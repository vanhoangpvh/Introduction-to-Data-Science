Gensoumaden Saiyuuki: Kibou no Zaika,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4476/Gensoumaden_Saiyuuki__Kibou_no_Zaika,"['Gensoumaden Saiyuuki: Kibou no Zaika continues the story of our protagonists on their journey to the west and as always they are involved in many problems and this time it is not the case.Basically the story is that one day they saw a mysterious light at first they believe that it is a shooting star but with the passing of history we become eternal that that mysterious light is the jade pearl that basically grants you any wish but as everything has its bad side Since if you have a good wish, that same one has its consequences in the course of the chapter we...meet a girl who turns out that she has the jade pearl just like we know her past (a bit interesting in my opinion) and there we have the group of Sanzou fighting to recover said pearl.In general, this OVA was quite good for me because of the story of the girl who, as I said, has something that catches my attention (not counting those that the original anime tells) since it touches a bit (or in a good way) It is difficult to be accepted and we seek to do whatever it takes without measuring the consequences as a phrase says ""one learns the value of things until they lose it"" I do not want to go into details on this point, better see this ova and write your opinionBut if we see it from a point, you keep seeing the same thing but longer and as always when there is a girl in the middle, it always ends up dying and Gokuu feeling bad for not being able to save her.So if you want to see it, I highly recommend it, I know that it is not the masterpiece but I assure you that it will not bore you. meet a girl who turns out that she has the jade pearl just like we know her past (a bit interesting in my opinion) and there we have the group of Sanzou fighting to recover said pearl.In general, this OVA was quite good for me because of the story of the girl who, as I said, has something that catches my attention (not counting those that the original anime tells) since it touches a bit (or in a good way) It is difficult to be accepted and we seek to do whatever it takes without measuring the consequences as a phrase says ""one learns the value of things until they lose it"" I do not want to go into details on this point, better see this ova and write your opinionBut if we see it from a point, you keep seeing the same thing but longer and as always when there is a girl in the middle, it always ends up dying and Gokuu feeling bad for not being able to save her.So if you want to see it, I highly recommend it, I know that it is not the masterpiece but I assure you that it will not bore you.']"

It's best to watch this first and then the movie before S2, since this recap does not mention the events of the film yet. Bell and Hestia provide some amusing dialogue while going over how far Bell has come as an adventurer. They show all the best fight sequences like the Minotaur and the titan-like monster.Jokes land well, Hestia gets jealous at romantic bits, all the usual stuff.Overall nothing new is added but it works for what it is and is worth a view.

Free! Movie 1: Timeless Medley - Kizuna - Character Butai Aisatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37858/Free_Movie_1__Timeless_Medley_-_Kizuna_-_Character_Butai_Aisatsu,"[""There are 4 episodes here, and it took a bit of doing to find them posted on Youtube, kindly translated also.Each episode is only 4 minutes and is supposed to be a preview the movie. Each episode focuses on different characters, and the beginning is the same spiel about how to get pictures taken (okay to take pictures, please do not use flash, okay to share etc.) The endings are the same also, more of the usual cinema public service announcements on using the correct exits in case of emergency, turn of your cell phone, etc. etc.  So needless to say, due to the...length and brevity there isn't much about the story (at all) and barely any character development although this does give us a chance to spend time with our favorite anime swimmers.This is kind of a glorified picture drama. The key part of each episode is the photo shoot. Yes. New content, posed, with plenty of props, featuring beautiful, handsome, eye candy for us to look at. And all of them are wonderful. There's even one with sailor outfits and dried fish in the background, while the characters quip with each other. I spent several enjoyable minutes pondering which guy looked the most photogenic in each photo, and wondering if these exist to use as wall paper for our electronic devices.Episode 1: Iwatobi relay 4 plus Rin in white suits with black shirts and white ties. Yummy!Episode 2: Iwatobi relay 4 in Sailor Outfits. Super cute.Episode 3: Samezuka relay 4 in street clothes. Hot!Episode 4: Iwatobi relay 4 plus Rin in striped pajamas.

Hakaba Kitarou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3710/Hakaba_Kitarou,"[""Hakaba Kitarou is the sixth adaptation of the original Hakaba Kitarou manga, which is more known as Gegege no Kitarou. It is a rather strange series that has a nice blend of comedy and horror. From the description and art, it may seem &quot;kiddie&quot;, like the other Gegege no Kitarou adaptations, but it is far from it. This series has quite a sense of humor, so those who like dark comedy may like this series.Story: Hakaba Kitarou does not actually have an overarching plot. Most of the episodes can stand on their own, and there is very little connection between what happens from the...previous episode to the next one, with the exception of one or two of the episodes. The titular character, Kitarou, is the last living descendant of the Ghost Tribe, and it is basically a story of his various encounters with different supernatural beings. The story in each of the individual episodes are interesting and a bit peculiar. The only downside though is that they become repetitive after the halfway point. A few of the later stand alone episodes felt like they were following a standard formula with variations here and there.Art: The art director, Takashi Kurahashi, is the same guy who did the wonderful art direction in Mononoke. I loved it there and I loved it here. The art style fits nicely in this series and is very distinct as each of the monster designs are original and unique. The series tends to use dark, gloomy colors, which nicely sets up the atmosphere, but when it uses brighter colors, it makes those colors more vibrant. This series also uses a lot of camera angles so the animation may seem a bit stiff in some parts.Sound: This series uses its soundtrack effectively to set up the atmosphere and mood. And unlike a lot of anime soundtracks, where they use musical scores and pieces, this soundtrack uses a lot of sounds. One of such often heard sounds is the clucky wood-hitting-on-wood sound. They also nicely utilize ghostly, supernatural sounds. The opening is very catchy, upbeat, and different from your usual OP, as it shows panels of the manga. It has also become one of my favorites. The ending, however, could have been better and is a bit bland compared to its wonderful opening. The voice acting is also very good, though I was a bit surprised at first by how low Kitarou sounded when he first spoke. His chuckle is very creepily well done.Characters: The majority of the cast are morally ambiguous. No one is entirely good and no one is entirely bad. You first have Kitarou, who is definitely not your average goody good shoe protagonist. He does things based almost purely on his own benefits. Then you have Nezumi Otoko, also called the Rat Man, who shows some antagonistic tendencies towards Kitarou, but is not exactly one. He is rational, and like Kitarou, does things if it benefits him. The side characters also show various shades of gray. It sounds as if I'm giving a lot of praise to the characters, but it works more like a double-edged sword. Although Kitarou and Rat Man's antics are amusing, I found myself not really caring for them for the most part. I should also warn that this series tends to kill off its character with little to no regard, so that may make it hard to feel for them.Enjoyment: I found some episodes amazing, I found exactly two of the episodes disappointing (the ones with a certain cat girl), and the others ranged from very good to decent. Many of the episodes could be hit or miss, so it basically comes down to whatever floats your boat. I enjoyed the majority of the episodes, save for the two that I thought were disappointing.Overall: I felt that this series did very well in how it sets up its atmosphere and weirdness. It was unique, had great art direction and an exceptional soundtrack, though the characters was what I felt as its weak point. They were not necessarily bad characters; I just didn&rsquo;t care for most of them. Who knows, maybe others will love them. The plot could have been a bit better in some of the episodes, but as a whole, it's unique as it is. Though, the series does leave certain things unexplained, but I guess they could always use the 'it's supernatural' explanation. Definitely a good and unique series, though it may not float everyone's boats. Final verdict: 7/10 previous episode to the next one, with the exception of one or two of the episodes.

And those who love to dwell in Japanese Ghost stories must have heard of or watched Ge Ge Ge no Kitarou (Spooky Kitarou) in their life. So what is different between Hakaba Kitarou (Graveyard Kitarou)- HK for short - and Ge Ge Ge no Kitarou (Spooky Kitarou) - GKfor short? Well, GK has been serialized and reanimated from the 1960s till 2018 almost 5 to 6 times and every time it has been about the haunting ghosts creating problems for normal humans and...Kitarou will save the day by purging these 'Bad Ghost or Demon, Obāke. But what about HK? Well, it's a new concept by Shigeru Mizuki sensei, the mangaka of these anime's manga, who crafted a new Kitarou who is not your hero but the Ghost Child. Watching GK, I have always wondered... There are ghosts in this anime but why is it not 'Spooky' as the title suggests? Umm... It is for children who got scared easily by any horror tale or story. GK is like the friendly Ghost stories that any grandparents would like to tell their grandchildren. But HK is not like that because it redefines the Kitarou from his horrified beginning from his birth and how this newborn child with the blood of Ancient Ghost Descendant or Clan will bring some spooky phenomenon to this world.For the story, I would like to give it - an 8, because it distinctly differs from the GK, and though some of the stories like Horror ride of the broken rail car, or Johnny the Vampire have been adapted from original work they hold their uniqueness in the retelling of the story and somewhat gloomy environment.For art, I should've given 9 but 8 would be sufficient. To talk about art, I have watched the black and white version of the 1960s up to the vibrant colorful version of 2007, each adaptation has brought its individualism but what is most amazing about HK is that it doesn't follow the old pattern but it brings out the very eerieness in the background of the very story. The darkened screen with less vibrant but effectively dense colors gives HK its very own horror surroundings.Sound... Well, it is 8 for me, again! Background music or Soundtrack gives you the spookiness of its own. You know, you're watching a horror anime but is it horror anime if there is no eerie sound of screeching door or heavy wind? HK gives you that pleasure.Character.... I'll say 9!! Why? Because I liked it that much! By omitting the original group of Kitarou's team members like Ittan Mommen and 3 more ghosts, this anime didn't lack any proficiency. But it did include Nezumi Ōtoko and somewhat Neko Onna in their sense. Without Nezumi Ōtoko there will never be anime comedy in Kitarou. And this Child Kitarou was like the Kitarou you'll never imagine because he's selfish, non-reliable and a problem child and that makes the difference.Enjoyment? Well, I enjoyed it very much that's why it's 8 from me, and you know why is that, right?Overall it stands at 8. Well, nobody is perfect but still, it's worth a try to give a modern adaptation a chance because you don't know how different may your perspective may change...Please give it a try...

However, knowing the truth about their existence isn’t as important when Youkai have undoubtedly played an influential role in Japanese art, history, culture, and identity. Youkai can be found everywhere in modern art, especially being referenced or playing huge roles in video games and anime. The modern revitalisation of Youkai can be traced back to the heavily influential manga Gegege no Kitarou by Shigeru Mizuki, which popularised Youkai culture in the mainstream in the 1960s. Gegege...no Kitarou’s idea of Youkai was that of creatures who had stories to be told, creatures that needed to be understood. Kitarou, the main character of the series, made it his mission to allow Youkai and humans to live in harmony. He wants to befriend both sides in the hopes that youkai and humans can understand each other. The themes and ideas represented in Gegege no Kitarou were undoubtedly incredibly influential, with anime like Natsume Yuujinchou and even Youkai Watch sharing a lot of common themes with Kitarou.Hakaba Kitarou represents almost none of these ideas. In fact, this series is almost the complete opposite of everything Gegege no Kitarou and its subsequent influences stood for. It’s actually impressive how different Hakaba is from its counterpart. So, the question now is: just what exactly is Hakaba Kitarou?Not to be confused with the renaming of the Weekly Shounen Magazine version of Hakaba Kitarou, which changed to Gegege no Kitarou in 1967, Hakaba Kitarou’s anime adapts the stories told in the Kashi-hon release of Hakaba Kitarou in 1959. This version of the story is much more gruesome and cynical than its counterpart, and this is seen most clearly in its characters. Hakaba’s take on the character of Kitarou is that of a self-fulfilling asshole, only seeking to perform actions that benefit himself and no one else. This is reflected in the episodes where Kitarou straight-up curses other humans, something you never see his future counterpart do. But, to give him credit where credit is deserved, Kitarou specifically curses those who are greedy and cause harm to others. But still, Kitarou doesn’t seek to unite Youkai and humans; on the contrary, he seems to have fun seeing humans being tormented. Throughout the anime, Kitarou seems to take a backseat, not really intervening with the Youaki or humans. This is an interesting difference from Gegege, since Kitarou in the main series acts as a hero who’s there to save the day. While there are moments where Kitarou’s humanity is shown, like in the Neko Musume story, Kitarou never shows any sign of alignment. He’s neither good nor bad, creating this moral ambiguity that the viewer can never be certain about.Hakaba isn’t afraid to show death in the most gruesome of ways possible, with many of its characters dying a horrible, and I mean horrible, death. There’s even a character who is a clone of Kitarou who just randomly dies one episode and never shows up again, which I found to be rather humorous looking back. This grim and macabre portrayal of death is one with very little subtlety, often used as the answer to greed and corruption within its world. My problem with this is the lack of substance to convey any other interesting ideas or messages. Hakaba Kitarou has very little value for human life, so much so that it is in complete opposition to the themes of Gegege no Kitarou. However, this is only a personal complaint, since this portrayal of death is certainly an aesthetic choice in conjunction with the anime as a whole.One thing you may immediately notice upon watching Hakaba Kitarou is that its art style is awfully familiar. Takashi Kurahashi, the art director of Mononoke, also played the role of the art director of Hakaba Kitarou. Many of Mononoke’s visual sensibilities can be found within Hakaba with the choice of colouring, shading, and texture of the drawings, as well as general shot composition with a focus on still wide angles that help create an eerie atmosphere during certain scenes. The sound design is also particularly noticeable, with a focus on the use of classical Japanese instruments and sound effects to assist with the overall eerie atmosphere. Hakaba Kitarou consistently has an unsettling aura to it, one that is only matched by the likes of Mononoke. It helps that the entire aesthetic style of Hakaba complements the overall atmosphere and pacing in a way that is incredibly unique to itself.If the sound of macabre themes and gruesome portrayals of death all wrapped within a creepy and atmospheric art style sounds interesting to you, then I highly recommend giving Hakaba Kitarou a watch. While it may be a huge departure from Gegege no Kitarou, and by huge, I mean a complete 180, Hakaba Kitarou is a great little series separate from the main decade-long anime franchise and provides an interesting insight into what Kitarou could’ve been. no Kitarou’s idea of Youkai was that of creatures who had stories to be told, creatures that needed to be understood.

Blood: The Last Vampire,https://myanimelist.net/anime/405/Blood__The_Last_Vampire,"[""Since this movie was short, I will make my review just as brief:It felt like I walked into the theater 15 minutes late, then part way in I forgot I had to be somewhere and had to leave 15 minutes early.The animation and art design is quite nice, but the lack of character development and very minuscule plot left me feeling so bewildered and confused - I still don't understand why this was apparently so popular at the time it came out. "", 'Blood: The Last Vampire represents something of a departure for Production I.G., and for anime as a medium, not in terms of plot or characters, but in terms of production. Traditional animation techniques were replaced completely by digital animation, whilst the character designs lost the standard ""clean and simple"" line structure that has been a mainstay of the animation field for many years. In addtion to these, the movie was also a departure in terms of audio, in particular because of it\'s dub, and also because of it\'s target audience (more on these points in a bit though).But is is any good?The story is a...fairly straightforward tale of violence, with vampires, girls in sailor-fuku, and big things with wings thrown in for good measure. Blood is nothing if not direct with it\'s approach, something which I applaud as the penchant for anime has often verged on the melodramatic, and one needs only to mention a fight from DBZ...Plotwise this is actually a rather enjoyable romp in the realms of fantasy action. Being an original concept, rather than a remake/re-envisioning/adaptation/copy, the writers had the advantage of being able to tailor the plot any way they wanted to, and with director Kitakubo Hiroyuki having artistic license with the material, it\'s only natural that Blood has an experimental feel to it at times. The story moves along from start to finish at a fair clip and, whilst there is very little in the way of background detail, what information is imparted to the viewer is done so in the same direct manner I mentioned earlier.There isn\'t really any beating about the bush here, which is refreshing to see, however the movie does have some problems here and there with it\'s plot, the main one being that it simply peters out instead of reaching a proper conclusion. This can give the movie an unfinsihed feel, and can make the viewing experience unsatisfying for some people (although I don\'t see it as a problem - explanation later on).As I\'ve mentioned already, Blood was made using techniques that were a clear departure from standard anime practices, but what does that actually mean anyway?In the simplest terms, Bood is a visual feast. The use of digital animation over tradition cel based methods means that the movie can run at a higher speed than normal. The result of this is that the animation is far more fluid than it would normally be. Likewise the ""rough and ready"" design of the characters, in particular the adoption of rough lines over smooth with character features and clothing, adds a far more natural element to the overall product. These two factors, when coupled with the movie\'s low-level of lighting and muted colour palette, produce some startling on-screen effects, in particular a kind of natural ""motion blur"" (ask me if you want an explanation).The movements of the characters and the Chiroptera are extremely natrualistic, far more so than one would expect. The use of rough lines also manages to convey a depth of emotion from the characters that is just not possible to achieve with clean, simple lines. Terada Katsuya, the chief character designer, explained in an interview that the use of rough lines in the movie was to reflect the fact that there are no clean and simple lines in real life. The movie uses this fact to provide characters that have some of the most expressive features I\'ve seen in anime.The other area of departure was in the movie\'s audio department. Blood, unlike other anime before, was made to have an English dub with Japanese subtitles (making it the first anime to do so). Production I.G. had made their target audience the Western anime markets and they had to make the movie appeal to Western fans. Ironically, the dub is also one of the reasons why the movie became a hit in Japan. Most Japanese fans found it a novel experience to watch an anime that was clearly Japanese, but in English with subtitles.Aside from the dub, the sound effects were truly astounding. The various crashes and bangs, the sickly, fleshy noises, the whines and screeches, and more besides, are all lovingly realised. The atmosphere is positively littered with noise of one sort or another, with no scene being truly silent (even though it may initially sound that way). This lends a depth to the overall atmosphere of the movie, and highlights the fact that whilst Saya may be fighting otherworldly creatures, the rest of the world is proceeding as normal.Musically the movie is actually pretty good. What music there is, is often atmospheric, but muted to a degree so that it doesn\'t impact too much on the scene. This is a pretty effective way of heightening the tension, and whilst it\'s nothing new in terms of visual media, it\'s nice to see the technique used to good effect here.Blood: The Last Vampire may be a visual and aural triumph, however this has come at a cost. The characters are individuals to a tee, however they are also one dimensional. The movie is very short, so there is little room for character development in any way. The viewer is given some hints about Saya, but these are nowhere near enough to satisfy the diehard character junkie. Everyone else though, will simply ignore this in favour of watching some great action.I, personally, think that Blood: The Last Vampire is one of the unsung heroes of modern anime. Not only does it have some of the best action available in the medium, it also pioneered several techniques that have become standard practice in the industry. The movie has received phenomenal success both in Japan and abroad, garnering numerous awards and accolades along the way.That doesn\'t mean that you\'ll enjoy it though.Because of the problems it has with it\'s characterisations, and the story that doesn\'t really go anywhere, it would be easy to say that this movie is nothing more than a glorified advert for the manga and light novels. This is a justifiable perspective, however I think that rather than focusing so much on those issues, one should simply watch this as if you were watching Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, any Schwartzenegger movie, Rambo, etc. This is actually the best way to fully appreciate the movie in fact, as it isn\'t meant to be a cerebral effort, but an entertaining one.If you haven\'t watched Blood: The Last Vampire, then you may be missing out. This is an iconic anime that pushed the boundaries of the medium, as well as reminding Western studios and critics that anime was coming of age. I found this to be a most enjoyable fantasy action romp that didn\'t require any deep thought or introspection. In the same direct manner of the movie, it did exactly what it set out to do.It entertained me. Nothing more, nothing less. fairly straightforward tale of violence, with vampires, girls in sailor-fuku, and big things with wings thrown in for good measure. Blood is nothing if not direct with it\'s approach, something which I applaud as the penchant for anime has often verged on the melodramatic, and one needs only to mention a fight from DBZ...Plotwise this is actually a rather enjoyable romp in the realms of fantasy action. Being an original concept, rather than a remake/re-envisioning/adaptation/copy, the writers had the advantage of being able to tailor the plot any way they wanted to, and with director Kitakubo Hiroyuki having artistic license with the material, it\'s only natural that Blood has an experimental feel to it at times. The story moves along from start to finish at a fair clip and, whilst there is very little in the way of background detail, what information is imparted to the viewer is done so in the same direct manner I mentioned earlier.There isn\'t really any beating about the bush here, which is refreshing to see, however the movie does have some problems here and there with it\'s plot, the main one being that it simply peters out instead of reaching a proper conclusion. This can give the movie an unfinsihed feel, and can make the viewing experience unsatisfying for some people (although I don\'t see it as a problem - explanation later on).As I\'ve mentioned already, Blood was made using techniques that were a clear departure from standard anime practices, but what does that actually mean anyway?In the simplest terms, Bood is a visual feast. The use of digital animation over tradition cel based methods means that the movie can run at a higher speed than normal. The result of this is that the animation is far more fluid than it would normally be. Likewise the ""rough and ready"" design of the characters, in particular the adoption of rough lines over smooth with character features and clothing, adds a far more natural element to the overall product. These two factors, when coupled with the movie\'s low-level of lighting and muted colour palette, produce some startling on-screen effects, in particular a kind of natural ""motion blur"" (ask me if you want an explanation).The movements of the characters and the Chiroptera are extremely natrualistic, far more so than one would expect. The use of rough lines also manages to convey a depth of emotion from the characters that is just not possible to achieve with clean, simple lines. Terada Katsuya, the chief character designer, explained in an interview that the use of rough lines in the movie was to reflect the fact that there are no clean and simple lines in real life. The movie uses this fact to provide characters that have some of the most expressive features I\'ve seen in anime.The other area of departure was in the movie\'s audio department. Blood, unlike other anime before, was made to have an English dub with Japanese subtitles (making it the first anime to do so). Production I.G. had made their target audience the Western anime markets and they had to make the movie appeal to Western fans. Ironically, the dub is also one of the reasons why the movie became a hit in Japan. Most Japanese fans found it a novel experience to watch an anime that was clearly Japanese, but in English with subtitles.Aside from the dub, the sound effects were truly astounding. The various crashes and bangs, the sickly, fleshy noises, the whines and screeches, and more besides, are all lovingly realised. The atmosphere is positively littered with noise of one sort or another, with no scene being truly silent (even though it may initially sound that way). This lends a depth to the overall atmosphere of the movie, and highlights the fact that whilst Saya may be fighting otherworldly creatures, the rest of the world is proceeding as normal.Musically the movie is actually pretty good. What music there is, is often atmospheric, but muted to a degree so that it doesn\'t impact too much on the scene.

The ending as is to be expected is pretty open-ended, although Blood+ can give you an additional fill if you want.Over all this OVA excells. The story is so well-written, it might not have that much in the way of character development due to how short it is, but the way they present the vampires is very believable, the director himself stating how he wanted to present vampires as in-between evolution, something few anime do, or overdue as is the case of Trinity Blood, where there is evolution, but it is accompanied with near magical powers. Blood...has none of this. The transformations are gruesome, and the end result a bat-like creature not unlike the one found in Batman. This is why the story and animation are great, they pull out all the stops to present this version of chiropterans (vampires) as something that might indeed exist.The main character is silent, so in terms of sound there isn\\'t much to say about her, but the screams of the chiropterans can be to some bone chilling, and the dialogue wastes no time ensnaring you in the story, with pretty well cast voice actors, and an ocassional scene thrown in to leave you confused and wanting more, you\\'ll know when and if you have seen it, particularly towards the end.Excellent story, inspired artwork, great battle scenes and loads of vampire goodness make this a must see for anyone into vampire or horror anime has none of this.

I thought it was really good (aside from the voice acting) up until the ending. It was extremely short and ended quite abruptly. I honestly thought the ending credits were a delayed beginning credit sequence.

Both of which had a lot of issues, but I felt were decent enough overall. The odd thing is that I\'ve never seen the movie that inspired them before. This is one of those rare cases where the anime film wasn\'t based on anything but had a manga, light novels and several anime based off of it. Of course, that doesn\'t mean it\'s necessarily good. It might be. It could also be rather dreadful or decent enough like the anime it spawned. Only one way to find out, this is...Blood: The Last Vampire.We open our story with Saya working hard to hunt chiropteran because... she can? It\'s never really explained. She\'s sent to a school on an American base where chiropteran are suspected to lurk and that\'s where the story elements mostly end and it becomes a long string of action sequences. This film does present some interesting ideas, the issue is that they aren\'t quite there. The chiropteran seem like an interesting monster, but you don\'t learn anything about them except that they feed on humans and can shapeshift. The organisation that Saya is working with seems like it could be really interesting, but you don\'t learn anything about it, it\'s just vaguely mysterious. It\'s hinted that Saya has some connection with the chiropteran, but there are no details or clues about what it could be. What little plot you get is kind of a standard monster hunting story.The characters aren\'t very well developed in this either. Saya is just an archetypal action girl with unclear motivations. David is largely a blank slate character. He supports Saya in battle, whether it\'s due to some sense of duty or a connection with her is never clear. Most of the remaining characters show up for one or two scenes before disappearing from the film. Except for the Nurse who pretty much just exists to get rescued.The art is pretty good. There are a lot of good details in the backgrounds and the chiropteran do have interesting designs. The action sequences are well paced and intense as well. Of course, the blood in this works nothing like real blood, that seems to be an issue with the whole Blood franchise. The facial expressions are also off, frequently looking nothing like the emotion that\'s supposed to be being expressed.The voice acting is one of the weaker elements. Part of the problem is that they did a lot of the dialogue in English. Which makes sense in the context of the story but neither Kudou Youki nor Nakamura Saemi has a great sense of the language. You can tell they\'re really trying, but a lot of the dialogue frequently sounds kind of stilted like they\'re reading from a script and there are some lines where you can just hear them struggle. Kudou Youki only has noticeable problems with more complicated words like ""jurisdiction"" or ""investigate."" Nakamura Saemi doesn\'t fare that well and just about every English line she gets sounds really unnatural. Then you have Joe Romersa who, although he has no problems with the dialogue, is just awful when it comes to acting. The music, on the other hand, is fairly well done, although it\'s nothing special.The yuri factor is a 1/10. There\'s no yuri in this.My final rating for Blood: the last vampire is going to be a 4/10. It\'s not a bad film and it obviously has some good ideas. However, the ideas aren\'t quite there and the execution is riddled with problems. It\'s kind of enjoyable in a generic action film way, but there\'s very little in terms of substance.

It looks and sounds great. It is probably worth checking out if you get the chance just for the lush visuals. It doesn't really seem like a real feature film though. It's only 40 odd mins long. There's no real plot, there's no attempt at developing any characters with any real depth, and there's absolutely no human emotion to be found anywhere. It hints at some kind of religious and political subtext but it never attempts to really explore those avenues. There is obviously a wider story going on underneath...but you won't find it in the film. Apparently there's both a manga and anime series so maybe those ideas are explored within those. They certainly aren't here. It's literally 40mins of someone running around chopping up demons with a sword (and at one point a spade). Let's be honest. A bit of mindless eye candy can be a lot of fun. Oh yeah, some of the English language voice acting in places is terrible too.As a proper film this probably deserves 5/10 just about. If you want 40mins of straightforward gorgeous looking action as distraction this will fit the bill. If you're an animation enthusiast or a student of cinema then technically there's a lot to be admired here and it really is worth checking out just for the 5 star animation and visual style.

Everyone has heard of the mystical vampire- and we have had a cultural fascination with them for nearly 200 years- since John Polidori\'s ""The Vampyre"" was released. There\'s something enthralling about the sanguineous, and its association with the occult, something we just can\'t get enough of.In 2000, Production IG went out on a limb and produced an anime original story about a vampire who fights...and kills insane, frenetic, bloodthirsty beasts called Teropterids. Nearly invulnerable, impervious to bullets, crushing, and concussive forces, the Teropterids are a formidable foe that can only be killed by one means: the blood of a vampire. The story takes place on halloween, 1966, in a US Air Force base in Japan and the high school for the kids living there. What happens on this night is something they\'ll never forget... unless they\'re told to, that is.The animation for this movie is near exceptional. Easily one of the better animations of the late 90s and early 00s, rivaling FLCL in quality- and as an original, did not benefit from the budgets that many contemporaries had. It has some of the best usage of 3D CGI Production IG\'s ever done, even better than in the Ghost in the Shell series, and the characters move with great fluidity and detail. Everything is very crisp and smooth, and the dark, subdued palette of blacks, grays, and red give it a sort of neo-noir feel.What\'s even more fascinating about this incarnation of Blood is the audio.This movie is unique in several ways- definitely a first out of many anime I\'ve ever seen- in that it has dual audio. This movie was never originally fully in Japanese, nor an English dubbed original. It was something of an experiment to feature both Japanese and American characters who spoke their respective languages (and for a handful, both)- and an experiment that works to great success. The voice acting is handled very well, and it\'s not just Japanese VA phoning in some bad engrish, nor is it American VA taking a stab at Japanese phonology.It\'s a true dual effort- with Japanese people voicing their language, and Americans doing theirs. As an anime watcher, I\'ve long wanted to see a show where the voices were handled this way. It\'s utterly silly to think that an anime can take place in a country like Germany or England and every NON ethnic Japanese speak perfectly inflected Japanese. Blood: The Last Vampire takes a very sophisticated approach to this issue, and benefits greatly from it, while making it a rare and unusual example of the medium.The story and characterization are sadly lacking in this, though. Where Blood+ had 50 episodes to build up characters and motives, in Blood: The Last Vampire, we\'re thrown immediately into the action. The movie is only 45 minutes long, but there\'s some real tension in the story, and some great action with the appropriate gore to match the crimson tone it sets for itself. At the same time, the motives and origins are muddled, and there\'s a distinct lack of a central antagonist. The characters themselves names\' are recycled in Blood+, but this story has no bearing on either it, nor Blood C.(The reader may be aware of the series Blood+ or Blood C- which are related, but this was the original version before the manga was written, which would then be adapted into the popular Blood+). It serves best as a standalone bloody action romp involving some familiar but different characters.Blood: The Last Vampire has a lot to offer in a little package- excellent animation that\'s held up very well, a mindless but fun action plot, and some very unusual, but well executed, voice acting.

It\'s short running time (48 mins) basically ensures that there is not a lot of time for character development and plot development.Blood: The Last Vampire is particularly noteworthy for two things; being an anime filmed almost entirely in English, and being completely digitally animated, a groundbreaking new way to animate when this came out in 2000. It even lead James Cameron, of Titanic and Avatar fame, to say ""The world will come to consider this work as the standard of top quality in digital...animation.""Essentially, Blood: The Last Vampire boils down to two things; action and animation. As alluded to earlier, the plot in this movie is razor thin and merely exists as a means to get one character into another fight scene. You almost have to view this as a prologue of sorts to a larger story, one that does continue in other mediums like manga and video games.Lucky for us, as a short, strictly action based movie, Blood: The Last Vampire manages to be compelling largely because of the aesthetics and animation. The movie is set in the American Yokota Air Base in 1966, amidst nervousness over a war in Vietnam. Our protagonist is Saya, a vampire-human hybrid os sorts tasked with killing Chiropterans, bat-like vampires that feed off of human blood. Quite literally, that is the entire plot. Even the number of characters with significant roles is kept to a bare minimum, outside of David, a member of Red Shield organization he and Saya work for, and a school teacher who gets to see all the carnage of the fights before her eyes, we really don\'t get to know anyone. Even Saya and David have precious little information about them revealed.But the film is really a sight to behold. The digital animation allows complex movements to be animated much better than traditional cel animation. Camera tricks usually reserved for live action films are used here, and everything has a fluidness and crispness that makes the action scenes extremely enjoyable to watch. The world itself we\'re thrust into is darkly gorgeous, too, full of grey and brown and muted lighting, the 60s setting combined with the darkness gives off an air of dystopian-esque retrofitting, even though it is not strictly a dystopian movie.And so, for a little under an hour, we are treated to a bevy of gruesome action scenes that work to impress us visually as well as impose a sense of dread. They do that admirably. Even though we don\'t get to know Saya and David all that well, we still find ourselves cheering for them in their struggle, the knowledge that these Chiropterans are bad imparted to us by the gruesome ways in which they kill people. This is truly a movie of actions speaking louder than words. Luckily for us, the action is fast, fluid, and exciting, and rarely feels over-the-top or unnecessary.Combining the great artwork with a great sound department also allows the dark, fearful atmosphere to escalate. While the voice acting isn\'t anything to write home about - Saya is very monotonous (intentionally) and David doesn\'t show too much emotion either, the creepy noises of the Chiropterans, the gruesome sounds of battle, and the eerie music all lend to the atmosphere. It\'s not exactly a horror movie; the action is too rampant for that, but it all helps to escalate the already dark mood that the animation sets.While Blood: The Last Vampire isn\'t a deep film, or one with a great plot or cast of characters, it offers a bevy of gorgeous thrills and chills wrapped up an a very aesthetically entertaining setting. It is strictly a no holds barred, non-complex action film and nothing more, but for what it\'s worth, it plays that part well.7/10 animation.""Essentially, Blood: The Last Vampire boils down to two things; action and animation. As alluded to earlier, the plot in this movie is razor thin and merely exists as a means to get one character into another fight scene. You almost have to view this as a prologue of sorts to a larger story, one that does continue in other mediums like manga and video games.Lucky for us, as a short, strictly action based movie, Blood: The Last Vampire manages to be compelling largely because of the aesthetics and animation. The movie is set in the American Yokota Air Base in 1966, amidst nervousness over a war in Vietnam. Our protagonist is Saya, a vampire-human hybrid os sorts tasked with killing Chiropterans, bat-like vampires that feed off of human blood. Quite literally, that is the entire plot. Even the number of characters with significant roles is kept to a bare minimum, outside of David, a member of Red Shield organization he and Saya work for, and a school teacher who gets to see all the carnage of the fights before her eyes, we really don\'t get to know anyone. Even Saya and David have precious little information about them revealed.But the film is really a sight to behold. The digital animation allows complex movements to be animated much better than traditional cel animation. Camera tricks usually reserved for live action films are used here, and everything has a fluidness and crispness that makes the action scenes extremely enjoyable to watch. The world itself we\'re thrust into is darkly gorgeous, too, full of grey and brown and muted lighting, the 60s setting combined with the darkness gives off an air of dystopian-esque retrofitting, even though it is not strictly a dystopian movie.And so, for a little under an hour, we are treated to a bevy of gruesome action scenes that work to impress us visually as well as impose a sense of dread. They do that admirably. Even though we don\'t get to know Saya and David all that well, we still find ourselves cheering for them in their struggle, the knowledge that these Chiropterans are bad imparted to us by the gruesome ways in which they kill people. This is truly a movie of actions speaking louder than words. Luckily for us, the action is fast, fluid, and exciting, and rarely feels over-the-top or unnecessary.Combining the great artwork with a great sound department also allows the dark, fearful atmosphere to escalate. While the voice acting isn\'t anything to write home about - Saya is very monotonous (intentionally) and David doesn\'t show too much emotion either, the creepy noises of the Chiropterans, the gruesome sounds of battle, and the eerie music all lend to the atmosphere.

Not that it\'s a bad movie at all. It fares pretty well despite the length, with no glaringly big flaws to pick apart.Being an action heavy movie, the action is obvious a very important aspect, and it\'s something that ""Blood: the Last Vampire"" delivers on all accounts. The action is fluid and bloody, fast and furious from beginning to end, with very little respite in the middle. The thickly atmospheric direction is brilliant at times, especially in the opening scenes....The artwork is fittingly dark and generally good all round, though the drawing of the characters themselves weren\'t so hot.In a break from tradition, ""Blood"" mostly uses English voices as it takes place in a US base. However, the original language being in English doesn\'t appear to have stopped the English voices from sounding lacklustre like it generally does on a dub.It seems like a lot of people feel very much let down by ""Blood: the Last Vampire"", and that\'s probably because of the story. The main storyline in this movie is very simplistic, and mostly self contained, but it does drop tantalising hints regarding a much bigger mystery that this movie is only a small part of. Could they have revealed more by making the movie longer? Perhaps. But then again, a longer movie might not be able to incorporate enough information to make this movie complete, and you would end up with an even less standalone work that\'s neither here or there. As it stands, I didn\'t find the presence of a couple of loose ends bothered me *that* much.Admittedly, though this movie managed to do quite well what little time it has, I did find it slightly lacking because it\'s so short - if you saw it at a cinema, you\'d probably ask for your money back for only getting to see half a movie. Outside the cinema though, you could do a lot worse than spend 50 minutes watching this.

If you want you can read my review in Spanish.When someone intends to immerse themselves in the Blood franchise, it should be noted that the starting point is found in the 45-minute medium-length film directed by Hiroyuki Kitakubo (Roujin Z, 1991; and Golden Boy, 1995-1996): Blood: The Last Vampire ( 2000). At the time this film triumphed, winning awards at film and animation festivals and praise from numerous fans and some critics. Part of this success was due to the fact that it was a film designed to reach foreign audiences, with attractive plot elements for a...non-exclusively Japanese audience and the filming practically in English. But its success also lay in the use of digital animation for various stages of the production process, such as coloring. At a time when anime was changing traditional methods for digital ones, it made it stand out among the majority, especially since the result was much more spectacular.Unlike other works in the same franchise, Blood: The Last Vampire can be classified as a simple introduction to its universe. In fact, very brief because it barely provides information on who the secret organization, Saya and the Chiropterans, would become. In simple terms, it is an action movie with horror elements that is about a powerful vampire slaying evil beings that threaten the human species. Nothing more. It could almost go through a chapter of some action series without much pretense because it is, from the point of view, basic even for the action cinema of that time. It hardly has a minimal context capable of answering the viewer\'s questions about the key elements of the narrative.However, outside of its excellent production we can point out more than one notable trait. One of them corresponds to its atmosphere, characterized by being gloomy and dull. The weak lighting, the brown, gray and black colors, the pale skin of the characters, the dominance of the night or the last moments of sunset, the silence or the cold demeanor of Saya. All the elements contribute to leaving this feeling that the whole is quite gloomy. A merit that is rare in Japanese animation, where even in horror works there are too many flashy and extravagant facts. Although what is most striking is that it is subtle in limiting dialogues and prioritizing silence, demonstrating that he knows how to communicate without words. An example is the scene in which Saya expresses compassion for the monster, since she is dying and she prefers to kill him using her blood.Another highlight is, of course, the action. Despite lacking the distinctive disproportion of the more violent anime, Blood: The Last Vampire is characterized by confrontations with monsters in which the action is gory and agile. He would have said fleeting, but Saya\'s fighting is complicated due to the lack of an effective weapon. A fact that, by the way, gives tension since Saya is not exactly a weak girl. Not having her sword in good condition and having to take care of a hostage, Saya experiences various situations where she is on the ropes. My biggest but, however, is that there are no great encounters. It all comes down to enduring and slowly damaging the monster while she waits for her new weapon to be brought to her. Mind you, the moments when she carries out her execution are incredible. See when she kills her prey on the train, with the lights flashing and the camera thrown.Unfortunately, the good points I\'ve just listed and explained don\'t excuse a big problem with the movie: the characters. The protagonist, Saya, is the biggest drawback because the character is dry and cold. At no time does she open herself to the viewer, but she limits herself to fulfilling her mission and looking for a way to carry it out. We know that she is characterized by being lonely, surly and antisocial with those around her, but at no time are the reasons behind it explored. Obviously, the subtext gives us to understand that her character carries an internal conflict related to the fact that she is the only one of her species and with her distance between her and us. In fact, the brief relationship between Saya and the nurse brings out this problem a bit because of the way he interacts with her in the midst of danger. However, the conflict finally remains in the shadows and the image that remains of this relationship is that of a woman who is screaming and another who tries to get rid of the first. There is less to speak of enemies because of the very ""bright"" hole in it. They could be replaced by other monsters with the same attributes and there would be no difference. Beyond suggesting a certain desire to survive, I find no question linked to these. The only credit I can find is her gruesome design, which illustrates how she is a creature less than a vampire.You can read my review here: https://elarmarioanimados.blogspot.com/2020/10/resena-blood-last-vampire.html non-exclusively Japanese audience and the filming practically in English.

What is more intriguing about her is that she works as an operative to a secret agency which locates and hunts down those demons....The setting is in an American Air force based in Japan and its surrounding civilian areas sometime in the 1960s.  Little time is wasted in introducing the main plot as it begun with Saya successfully hunting a Chiropterate in an underground train and the revelation on how the creatures have infiltrated the surrounding civilian areas, her job is to find and kill them before they could cause any more deaths. What follows is a search-and-destroy mission that spans a couple of land marks such as the local school, the US Air force base, and the town along the vicinity. The ending leaves something for the viewers to ponder about as it has many questions unanswered given the very short runtime of the movie.Animation is probably the highlight of this movie, it is a year 2000 animation but clearly it’s a class on its own during that time. The environment is very detailed and simply breathtaking, potentially rivaling even today’s best animations. The lighting effects are very well done and tiny details such as grain-like substance and motion blur in several fast moving scenes added even more impressive effects. The character designs somewhat resembles that of the original Ghost in the Shell movie, which gives this unique and detailed facial expressions that really describes what the feelings of the characters are and added the much needed seriousness as what the movie is all about. Other notable features of the animation are the smoothness of the character movements, the environment, and that of the transition scenes in general. The action scenes are also impressive looking, notable because on how the environment changes so much from being neat and tidy to a messy place due to the destructive effects of the fights. The debris, scratches, the blood-bathe, and other elements that make the place really looks like a fight did happen there are present.Sound effects are something the movie isn’t shy showing off. The soundtracks on the background is astonishingly good and convincing, especially since one of the setting is set on a Halloween Party complete with American music bands playing music appropriate for the occasion, it feels very American which is an added bonus to the viewers. Other sound effects such as shouts, screams, sword slashes, falling cabinets, and monster howls are also very well done; I personally got goose-bumps just from hearing the characters scream like there is no tomorrow for them. One of the important highlights of the movie is the dubbing which has both Japanese and English voice actors on it, so in effect the American characters really look like Americans because the dubs are obviously done by American voice actors, makes you think it’s done with western audience in mind while still feels very Japanese.Character is something the movie didn’t really focus on. The movie revealed nothing much about the main character Saya aside from the few things hinted on the movie, more so on the other characters which are not really that many by the way such as David which pretty much her companion in her mission, and the school nurse which has a vital role on the story. However, I like how everything flow smoothly, I can say that the producers did a good job in making an interesting movie that focus on its presentation and story, and not much on the characters.Blood: The Last Vampire is really a surprised find. The movie has an interesting plot accompanied by outstanding animation and sound effects that are truly impressive. My overall impression of this anime is that of very positive, this despite the relative shortness of the movie and lack of any character development as it didn’t really take away the enjoyment that I have in watching it other than the fact that I want more. I would recommend this to anyone who likes watching movies with supernatural and horror genres, as well as to anyone who simply wants a good anime to watch.

She did protect a completely useless character through the whole story, but that's where the peril came from. If not for here protecting a victim it would not have been as exciting.All in all, this was a really cool animated movie to watch. I definitely recommend it, and it does have high repeat value.

WHERE'S HAJI?!?! was my exact thoughts throughout the entire movie. But that aside, it was pretty good, the art reminded me alot of Ghost in the Shell and the dubbing was decent if I recall correctly. My only other negative comment is that the movie was a bit on the short side and it could've been a lot better if it was...a little longer. a little longer."", ""Τhe blood franchise is either hated or loved by the anime community. And while some of it's titles are not so  strong like the Blood C anime and it's movie that came after, ''Blood the Last vampire'' is probably the movie that even non fans of the franchise liked. The story is indeed interesting and because is the first entry of the series you don't need to watch any of the other anime of the series in order to watch this. It introduces you to Blood universe resembling more on Blood plus's though than Blood C's. The concept is the same a girl named...Saya is fighting a non-friendly to humans species named chiroptera. The movie is mostly a fight between her and those creatures so you expect only to see action, action and action. Which is exactly what this anime gives. So don't expect any deep story but an awesome fighting anime. The only thing I didn't like was the ending which was kinda rushed and  the length of the movie which was too short, not even one hour long. The art was simply flawless it reminds us why Production IG is considered one of the best animation studios in Japan. With it's dim drawings the anime gets you right into the dark world of Blood and with it's flawless animation it delivers amazing action scenes and fights. The sound section was remarkable. This anime is mostly voiced in English because some of the heroes are supposed to be Americans. And while the Japanese voice actors have a terrible history about terribly spoken English in this anime the results are wonderful. The voice actors are speaking English so fluently that initially I thought that I was watching the English dub of the anime. From the protagonists to the sideshows, either in English or Japanese language all of the voice actors were amazing. This proves how professionally this anime was made in all of its sections. About the characters I can't say much because due to the anime's short length the characters have no time for development and whatsoever. But you won't watch this anime for it's characters anyway (we have blood+ for that) but for it's awesome fights, so I don't believe any serious damage was done there. And also David from Blood+ one of my favorite characters in anime was playing a big role there so I believe this was a really good reason to give in the character section an 8.  Summarizing, ''Blood the Last Vampire'' was a really well-made anime, with a rather interesting story and amazing fights. Due to its really short length it's watched really easily and I don't believe that you will have a bad time watching it. Saya is fighting a non-friendly to humans species named chiroptera. The movie is mostly a fight between her and those creatures so you expect only to see action, action and action. Which is exactly what this anime gives. So don't expect any deep story but an awesome fighting anime. The only thing I didn't like was the ending which was kinda rushed and  the length of the movie which was too short, not even one hour long. The art was simply flawless it reminds us why Production IG is considered one of the best animation studios in Japan. With it's dim drawings the anime gets you right into the dark world of Blood and with it's flawless animation it delivers amazing action scenes and fights. The sound section was remarkable. This anime is mostly voiced in English because some of the heroes are supposed to be Americans. And while the Japanese voice actors have a terrible history about terribly spoken English in this anime the results are wonderful. The voice actors are speaking English so fluently that initially I thought that I was watching the English dub of the anime. From the protagonists to the sideshows, either in English or Japanese language all of the voice actors were amazing. This proves how professionally this anime was made in all of its sections. About the characters I can't say much because due to the anime's short length the characters have no time for development and whatsoever. But you won't watch this anime for it's characters anyway (we have blood+ for that) but for it's awesome fights, so I don't believe any serious damage was done there. And also David from Blood+ one of my favorite characters in anime was playing a big role there so I believe this was a really good reason to give in the character section an 8.

Not a particular great one, but hey, it's not half bad. It has some problems, but it also has a lot of bright points. I don't usually structure my reviews on here, but for this I decided to, so here's a list of pros and cons.PROS:-Beautiful animation. Seriously, for a anime movie from 2001, the art in this is gorgeous. It was like candy for my eyeballs, really.-The sound design and music are both excellent. Honestly, this could pass as an art film, it looks and sounds artsy enough and it's vague enough to appeal to people who...like their movies to be a little out there. If this were to come out today, people would eat it up just like they are Isle of Dogs, I guarantee it.-Really awesome fight scenes. Saya proved herself to be a really capable fighter in the hour or so that we got to know her, and I was glued whenever she was fighting a Chiropteran (which for those who havent seen the movie are what the vampiric monsters she fights are called)-Really interesting choices in script. See, instead of writing/filming the whole script in Japanese, they wrote it in English and made the main character bilingual, and even worked it into the story. The basic premise is that Saya is a vampire hunter, and she's assigned to investigate some murders at a high school located at an American military base in Japan where the teachers and staff are Japanese and the students are all American. Saya's handler, David, is also American, is so is pretty much every character other than Saya and the school nurse. It makes for a very interesting movie, and it definitely stands out from a lot of other anime films I've seen.CONS:-Way too short. Seriously, it kinda just feels like a really long short film. As a result, we don't get any sort of character development or anything of the like, and it's mostly just fight scene after fight scene with exposition dumps here and there. And even then, we really dont know much about the backstory. This movie raises way more questions than it answers, and this was made way before sequel-baiting was a thing.-The plot is extremely thin. Seriously, it feels kinda like a short film or some kind of proof of concept someone would make to convince an executive to greenlight a full movie or tv show. It doesn't drag or anything, but that's the problem-the pacing is way too fast in my opinion, and the movie feels like its ramping up to something that we never really get to see.-It's a little too light on the horror elements. We get a brief scene of some MP officer getting dragged up into a tree and eaten by one of the monsters, but other than that the movie never really gets all that scary. The only other unsettling scene in the movie is when Saya kills one the monsters in the nurse's office before she can transform, and that's just because at first you don't really realize what's going on and it looks like Saya just butchered this sick girl who didnt do anything wrong. Don't get me wrong, I like that scene because it establishes the monsters as calculating and cunning and it makes for a good shock factor, but I wish they had gone all in with the horror. This would honestly make an awesome horror movie.Do I reccomend this movie? Definitely. It's got some problems, sure, but there's nothing in it that I would consider godawful, and it had me pretty much hooked for the entirety of its extremely brief runtime. It's a shame they never made a sequel, I would've LOVED to see a second movie that explores Saya's past. (I'm aware there are two anime based on the movie, Blood+ and Blood-C, but those are both spinoffs that take place in alternate universe. They're both really good-particularly the first one-but neither one really seemed to enrapture me like the movie did. They also did a really crappy live action version of the movie around 2011 or so, and I DEFINITELY don't reccomend it. I don't reccomend ANY live action anime movie, actually. They all suck.) like their movies to be a little out there. If this were to come out today, people would eat it up just like they are Isle of Dogs, I guarantee it.-Really awesome fight scenes.

Instead of finishing off with a proper conclusion, it dwindles down and comes to a complete stop. This left me very confused at the end. What was up with that twist at the end? It ends up feeling largely unfinished. Nothing is really explained, thus we don't know what drives the characters to do what they do, like Saya, who just seems to be killing demons just because she can. Rather weak in this department.Characters: It suffers from the same thing the story does: The duration of the film....We aren't given enough background information, or more information in general, about any of the characters. All of them are flat and one-dimensional, even Saya, who's the main character and the one we are given the most information about. This also means that there's no room for characters to develop or for the audience to care about the characters.Visuals: Now we're getting into the real meat of this film! The art style is unique and stands out a lot amongst the average anime. It looks really damn nice! It utilizes rough lines as opposed to smooth ones, and combines them with other features, most notably the desaturated color palette and its low level of lighting. This creates some very pleasing shading, too. Not to mention the CGI in this film is mind-blowingly good. For something that came out in the 2000's, the CG holds up better than most anime today. The backgrounds and the movement of CG objects look fantastic! The animation, dear lord the animation! It's of exceptional quality, as expected from Production I.G! Tons of astonishing sakuga, very expressive character features, graciously smooth character movements and action sequences, and stupendous visual effects like the motion blur make this a true feast for the eyes! Definitely the highlight of this film!Audio: The dubbing, to my surprise, was really damn good! English has never sounded this good in an anime's original audio! The sound effects, like the animation, are top-notch. The music is also a treat. Mmm, exquisite.Overall: Blood: The Last Vampire is a film that although lacking in depth, is an anime that you definitely shouldn't miss out on. It along with other anime like FLCL, helped anime take a step forward in animation quality. Those looking for a short, action-packed, high production quality film that doesn't require deep thought will love this wonderful film; while those looking for something with more meat and less sweets probably won't enjoy it as much. 6.69/10, rounded to 7/10 for MAL score!

Back in 2001, Manga Entertainment were hyping this up as their next big movie.  It's certainly big in terms of production values.  But a movie?  It stretches that definition to the limit by being just over the 40 minute mark when the credits roll.  OAVs of that length are nothing unusual, but this one noticeably strains at the seams of its runtime.  Frankly, it's like walking in halfway through an 80s Hollywood B-movie.  The dialogue in the opening scene feels...like gibberish that's never explained, and there's a general lack of context throughout.  Plot is minimal, and characterisation is non-existent.It also suffers from being a bilingual production.  The American characters have that awkward patter to their voices that suggests Production IG just grabbed some random gaijin off the street and shoved them in the recording booth, as is often the case for live-action Japanese movies.  Saya and the school nurse (the fact she's never named, despite being the de facto main character, tells you how little they cared about the characters) are clearly Japanese VAs speaking English at times, and while their pronunciation is fine, they just can't act in English.So what works?  Well damn, this thing still looks good.  As a tech demo and artistic showcase for Production IG's skills, it's first rate.  The art, animation, and lighting are all astounding, and especially impressive when you consider what most digital anime looked like circa 2000.  The music is atmospheric too.  And...that's about it.  The action scenes are well directed, but you may be disappointed at how grounded they are.  Again, this feels like something that could have been shot as an 80s Hollywood B-movie.  It aims for realistic weight rather than anything flashy, and is perhaps too reserved as a result.  The 'fight' against the final monster is especially underwhelming in that regard.  Lastly, this was an early DVD release from Manga, and it hasn't aged well.  It has that aliased 360i look of an early Youtube video.If the visuals were as mediocre as the rest of it, I'd give this a 5, but they are still truly spectacular, so that drags it up a notch. like gibberish that's never explained, and there's a general lack of context throughout.

It lays the groundwork and carries loads of potential to be something grand.

In 45 minutes, the directors of this ""movie"" introduce a concept to us and leave it at there. The story is none-existent, character development is severely undercooked, and I watched the credits roll with more questions than answers.However, Blood: The Last Vampire...does a good job at setting up the character and world that we now know and love as Blood+.This ""movie"" (or long anime episode imo) is not a stand-alone piece and should not be seen as one.

It\'s all fine.I just don\'t think I\'ll even remeber having watched this.Maybe if I cared more about the characters.Also, there\'s a lot of english voice acting in this movie, and it\'s not great, to say the least. It\'s not even ""engrish"", they sound like english speakers, but their voice performances are jus really not good.At least it was short. I don\'t know wheter a longer runtime would have helped to flesh out the story and characters, but as it is,...I\'m fine with it being this short.

Apropos of the plot, Mamoru Oshii did a great work (good story in spite of being told in just 45 minutes), but the main strength of the film lays in its execution and direction.-- [This may contain minor spoilers about the ending] --About the plot, while pretty concise, the main idea behind it an the way it get developed according to the film\'s length is at least nice and ensures the idea that short doesn\'t mean incomplete...or bad at all. There\'re of course a lot of questions and doubts that remain in the air, like how and when did all this stuff begin, why Saya has her own restrictions with respect to her nature, or what about the relationship between Saya and the US forces she is cooperating with; but in spite of those unanswered issues the film itself is capable to tell what is needed to be told and it shows it in an amazing visual way.But those kind of ""plotholes"" are not plotholes at all indeed; they\'re just there in order to increase all the uncertainty and left the viewer imagination fill it as it happens with the nurse, which in a certain way is a ground wire in all this chaos whose point of view remains with the viewer til the very end.And respecting to the audiovisual part of the work, this is just outstanding. There could be tons of details to praise about it but the only thing I\'ll mention is the huge visual quality of every frame and special effects and lighting. It must be considered that, despite being a not so long feature film, made in year 2000, it was not shot in film at all. It\'s the entire film drawn digitaly and it still has better quality, visual details, effects and camera movements than any animated movie made on these days.Beyond that, the direction is superb, sublime. It\'s cinema. Nothing much different from one could expect for a Production IG feature film.The main issue i found is the voice acting. While it\'s pretty well done in the japanese dialogues (at least it sounds as always), the english ones are mostly really poor. There\'re some great line interpretations from David\'s VA during the climax eventually, but others scenes really sounds cringey. Sharon for example, she sounds as her VA was an 8 yo girl while reading a fancy book in her literature class at primary school (something I usually feel every time I hear an english dub version of every anime, which is why I cannot see any dubbed anime, but here it is more than just exagereted), which really can break the seriousness and also the creepy atmoshpere developed along the movie. This occurs with most of english spoken lines unfortunately.Anyways, as a whole this movie is an amazing piece of work. Could it be longer? Yes, and I\'d really liked it be at least 15\' longer, but for the plot and the stuff suppossed to must be shown it has a good length.

Hotori: Tada Saiwai wo Koinegau,https://myanimelist.net/anime/475/Hotori__Tada_Saiwai_wo_Koinegau,"['Over the decades anime has produced some of the most compelling works of visual fiction on the planet. Since the turn of the millenium though, it seems as though the medium has gradually matured in terms of content and focus. One of the reasons for this ""coming of age"" is critical and media attention, especially over the internet, however there is an even bigger impetus in this maturation process - recognition as a creator - and it\'s this driving force that fuels the award known as the Animax Taisho.Hotori: Tada Saiwai wo Koinegau (or, Hotori: I Only Want Happiness), is the script that won the...third Animax Taisho award, and was adapted into an anime in 2005. The original script was written by Miyazaki Maya (I don\'t know if there\'s any relation to the esteemed Miyazaki Hayao though), and the anime adaptation is, if anything, a singular example of the storyteller\'s art at work.The anime tells the tale of two children, a girl called Hotori, and a boy called Suzu, and the ensuing friendship and care they have for each other even though they are complete oppsites in the most basic and fundamental of ways.The plot is very simple and straightforward, yet possesses a complexity that is truly wondrous. The pacing never gets flat or stale, and the OVA approaches the bittersweet, yet hopeful, climax with a steady, unwavering tread. The story itself is both moving and sensitive, especially in it\'s depiction of the two children. Nothing is overblown or overly dramatic, and the whole show has a pervading sense of calm that belies the heartache of the characters.The most important aspect of the show is the question of what defines one\'s existence, purpose and place in the world - basically, what is a ""soul""? It\'s this one simple, yet extremely complex, question that is the cause of all the joy, pain, happiness and suffering for the characters, and it\'s to the credit of Miyazaki Maya that the tale takes a more sensitive and innovative approach than shows like Ghost in the Shell or Blade Runner. The idea of putting the question in the hands of two children, one of whom, is losing their ""soul"" while the other is gaining one, raises the OVA from being simply another bland concept anime, and while there will be those who view the use of children to be a play on the viewers sensitivities, the simple fact is that Hotori: TSwK works better because the main characters are children, and thus are more open to questioning the right and wrong of things. Adults would simply add complications to an already complex question.Visually the show looks very good. The characters are well designed for the most part, however their facial expressions are a little on the limited side. The backgrounds and settings are well realised. and there is a clear definition between the more naturalistic designs used for scenes in the greenhouse and outside the hospital, and the more clinical, detailed designs used inside the hospital and the Personality Plant. Animation is also pretty good, with the characters moving well for the most part, although there are on or two niggly little moments when something about the scene seems ""off"".One thing that is truly remarkable about Hotori: TSwK is the cast. All but one of the seiyuu have played leading roles in a number of well known shows, and it\'s a truly remarkable coup for a script written by a complete unknown to have such talented and experienced voice actors on board, regardless of any competition wins. As one would expect with such a great cast, the acting is very good throughout the OVA, and each of the seiyuu portrays their respective characters with a grace and sensitivity that is very much in keeping with the theme of the show.In terms of music the show is very well served for the most part, however there is one section where the track simply didn\'t fit the emotion of the scene. The OVA also makes good use of sound effects and silence, in particular during the opening few minutes of the OVA.As this is a single episode OVA, one would expect there to be little in the way of actual development in terms of the characters, however this is not the case with Hotori: TSwK. The fact that one person is gradually losing who they are while another is becoming someone else entirely makes for some strangely captivating development that, while semmingly sporadic, is very much in tune with the basic question of what defines a soul. The fact that the two main characters are children also acts as a buffer for characterisation, as one does not expect a child to be a fully formed individual, and because of this the characters, especially the two leads, work extremely well in their setting. Granted there\'s virtually no development to any of the other characters, however this is very much a secondary consideration when watching the show.Given that the script was written by an unknown in the anime world, it\'s surprising, but also pleasing, that Hotori: TSwK is as good as it is. The question of what constitutes a soul is handled very well, and while there is a similarity to other shows in certain ways, this represents a very different approach to the norm. While there is some definite science fiction elements to the series, they are downplayed in favour of a more human approach, and it\'s this that ultimately defines whether one enjoys the show or not.In essence, if you want your metaphysical questions put forward in a scientific or religious manner, then this may not be to your liking (it still doesn\'t hurt to give it a try though).Hotori: Tada Saiwai wo Koinegau is a remarkably simple story that encompasses a truly complex question, one that is epitomised by opposites and dichotomies, and it\'s to the credit of all parties involved in it\'s production that the show is able to impart it\'s message in such a clear and sensitive manner.

We seem to have an obsession with trying to define the undefined, and figure out exactly what element (if any) dwells within us, differentiates us from each other, and makes us more than just flesh and blood. Hotori: Tada Saiwai wo Koinegau (Eng. “Hotori: The Simple Wish for Joy”) is another one to add to the long list of anime about maintaining an identity in a technologically advanced world, but solid character concepts and good writing in...general are enough to make it a standout OVA that floats near the top of the mark.The story, set thirty years in the future, centers on a place called the “Personality Plant.” At the Plant, doctors create robots that are externally identical to humans, and slowly implant them with the memories of real humans who have died or are in the process of dying, thus allowing at least their personalities to live on even if their original bodies are gone. Suzu, a robotic child from the Plant, is being conditioned to turn into a replica of “Ryou,” the dead son of a pair of grieving parents. One day he meets Hotori, a girl suffering from a disease that eats away at her memories. The two share secrets with each other and become close friends. As time passes, Hotori's illness worsens, and the obvious question rears its ugly head: Should she have her memories preserved in a robot?It's not a complicated story, but it has a certain deviousness in the way it is structured to reflect the aforementioned theme of human identity. The OVA quietly asks whether it'd be better to fade away gently, or fight the inevitable and be forever remembered in a robotic replica. As humans, most of the cast members, Hotori included, seem inclined to think that memories placed in an artificial shell do not a human make; the devious part is that following this line of thought will lead to the conclusion that kind and helpful Suzu is not a “real” person, but an empty construct, a statement that no one, least of all Hotori, seems overly enthusiastic to make. The story and its narrative themes are cleverly interwoven, and the distinct lack of philosophical jargon or lengthy exposition is a definite plus.The OVA finds two noteworthy characters in Suzu/Ryou and Hotori. What makes them interesting is that they're fundamentally different in their illnesses—Hotori's memories are rapidly disappearing, while Suzu is rapidly gaining new ones—yet the effect on both of them is similar. They both feel like they're losing themselves, and question who they really are. So, despite the fact that they're opposites on one level, they're also capable of understanding each others' doubts and fears in a very personal way. This well-thought-out relationship is the driving force behind the OVA. At forty minutes, it wouldn't be fair to compare the character development found here to that of a feature-length film or a series, but given the rather limited time frame, a commendable job has been done. The pair might not be fully realized individuals in the way that we typically think of memorable characters, but they're strong concepts that are used to great effect.I'm generally wary of the use of children as main characters, as they're sometimes included for the sole reason of preying on the audience's baser instincts and generating cheap sympathy, but here, I don't think that's the case. The OVA works, in part, because it adroitly points out that children can sometimes have a much better sense of what's right—what should and shouldn't be done—than adults. When the pair finally decide on the path they want to take, they proceed with ominous finality. These are kids who believe in nothing but each other, and there exists a certain terrible gravity in watching them put their heads together to make decisions that would turn most rationally thinking adults into sobbing wrecks. We don't sympathize with them just because they're kids, we sympathize with them because they're kids who are forced to bear responsibilities that no child should ever have to bear, and make adult decisions when their only tool is the simplistic logic of children.The OVA's weakest link is the music. There's nothing wrong with the soundtrack itself—quite the opposite. Much of its strength lies in orchestral pieces that start off subdued, but slowly build to an explosion of strings when the moment is right. However, odd musical choices occur on a couple of occasions. These normally manifest themselves in the form of upbeat jazzy/contemporary songs playing at times when they really shouldn't be, leading to some strange mishaps in which the scene seems to be saying one thing while the music is saying quite another. Taken as a whole, the music is better than average, and these flaws, while noticeable, aren't worth getting in too much of a twist over.Artistically, it's a pretty good looking product for its day and age. For the most part, the characters are designed well, but they have extremely small mouths (even by anime standards) and there are several moments where they're speaking, but the lip-flap animation is near invisible, making it almost look like conversations occur in a voice-over. The visual centerpiece of the OVA is the secret greenhouse where Suzu and Hotori play—as it should be, given its symbolic role. It's an attractive design, with the radiant greens and blues, highlighted by sunlight, being an obvious contrast to the dark institutional halls of the Personality Plant. There's a noticeable lack of depth in the backgrounds, giving them a flatness that's not very appealing, but the distinct use of light to bring out their coloration balances it out.Overall, this is an impressive OVA. There are some minor missteps in the technical areas, but inside lies a cleverly written story that approaches its themes with applause-worthy care.

Hotori explores the interactions between a human girl with a terminal illness (Hotori) and an android in the form of a boy (Suzu) who interact with one another as they share the problems they both share with memories, the former whose illness is destroying her memory and the latter whose memories are being formatted to resemble the dead child of a couple looking to adopt him.

While I\'ve grown up watching anime, it wasn\'t until 2005 when I learned that anime was originally made in Japan, and I hadn\'t quite developed my preferences nor made a point of watching anime all the way through until about 2010, when I was in high school. That being said, I lurk on Anime News Network pretty much on a daily basis, and long ago, there used to be this really good weekly column series called Buried Treasure, where Justin Sevakis would...talk about an obscure anime, its history, his opinions on it, and its overall availability. Some were good, others weren\'t, but I remember always looking forward to those articles as I always found them very interesting. I actually found a lot of my favorite anime through Buried Treasure, and I\'m sad the column was shut down. I do remember the very first Buried Treasure article I saw, which was one talking about a short, little known anime short film called Hotori: Tada Saiwai no Koinegau, which translates to The Simple Hope for Joy, but I saw a subtitled version that translated it as I Only Want Happiness, but I\'m just going to call it Hotori for the sake of brevity. The film came out in 2005, airing on Animax and based on a story that was the third winner of the Animax Grand Prix, a contest held by the channel of the same name to see which stories they could adapt to animation in some form. I remember watching Hotori after reading about it and liking it, though I forgot about it for years. This year, I rewatched it, and honestly? I think it still holds up surprisingly well, as much so as it did when I watched it as a kid.In the year 2034, technology has advanced to the point where humanoid robots can act like actual human beings with memories implanted into them. In a facility known as the personality plant, a robot named Suzu is being prepared to become a replacement son to a family whose child, Ryou, died from a disease, and a nurse monitors his progress every day as he receives new memories and learns all about the complexities of being human, such as understanding emotions and human interaction. While out playing, Suzu encounters a young girl, Hotori, who he finds out is slowly dying from an Alzheimer\'s-like disease that\'s making her forget her memories. The two of them become friends and bond over their opposite situations, and slowly, Suzu begins to grapple with his own feelings and doubts about being a replacement for a dead child. But when Hotori\'s symptoms get stronger, she makes a frightening request: She wants Suzu to shoot her with a gun she found in a greenhouse, as she doesn\'t want to die having forgotten all that was important to her.One thing I definitely noticed about Hotori upon rewatching it is that while the film was made in 2005, it really doesn\'t look like it. It has the look and feel of hand-painted cel anime from the late 90s, complete with slightly foggy backgrounds and the muted color palette. I say this as a compliment though, as the animation itself is pretty okay. Nothing groundbreaking for a digipaint anime from 2005, and by Sunrise standards its budget isn\'t the highest, but it does its job fairly well. Though if I had one complaint, it\'s that the eyes on the child characters are a little too big, almost making them look like aliens. It\'s not as bad as, say, the terrible Ijime OVA, but the big eyes do give the kids this really uncanny look to them. The music fares better though, with every usage of violins, pianos, saxophones, harps, cellos, and acoustic guitars fitting like a glove. I could probably give the soundtrack two words: Restrained and contemplative, never going overboard with trying to make you feel for the kids and their respective plights.Really, restrained and contemplative are pretty good words to describe Hotori as a whole. The movie is slow and gently paced, and the main conflict is sad, but fairly down-to-earth, with no real antagonist in sight. Since the film has a small cast of characters, and runs for about 40 minutes, it doesn\'t have a lot of time to develop them fully, which is fine. Characters like Suzu\'s nurse Usui and Hotori\'s father and brother serve their roles well, and their personalities and problems are down-to-earth and relatable, even with the sci-fi angle the movie is going for. Suzu and Hotori, the two leads, receive the most screentime and development, and the film makes great use of them, total opposites of one another, but still managing to make them interesting and relatable, showing their weaknesses and strengths and having them subtly change, from Suzu learning more about feelings and emotions to Hotori being scared of losing her memories and all that makes her herself. It also helps that the movie is pretty heavy on ""show, don\'t tell,"" relying more on body language and facial expressions to convey what the characters are feeling than relying heavily on dialogue and exposition dumping, and the gentle, low-key atmosphere of the film only elevates it, and everything else, beautifully. Even if the characters aren\'t the most three-dimensional and layered, they don\'t really feel like stock archetypes, though I wish we could have seen more of Ryou\'s parents and saw how they came to like Suzu as he is rather than just a replacement for their dead son.Now, I\'m sure people are going to take issue with the fact that a child wants her similarly-aged friend to help her commit suicide, and I can understand why. As far as I can tell, Hotori tackles the subject fairly sensitively and delicately, without relying too heavily on pointless melodrama, milking it for pathos, or treating it lightly. And don\'t worry, the film isn\'t as depressing as I\'m making it sound, as it also has a pretty nice ending that neatly resolves Suzu and Hotori\'s arcs. That being said, there are a lot of questions Hotori leaves unanswered as a result of going for that ending, but there are other questions it doesn\'t really try to answer as well: Since Suzu is a robot, is he going to stay a child forever, or will he grow up physically in some capacity? I can understand wanting to leave some things to the audience\'s imagination, but...food for thought.To quote Mr. Sevakis\' article, Hotori ~The Simple Hope for Joy~ is a pensive little jewel that reminds us of the joys of simply living, of accumulating memories. It walks a delicate line, maintaining a solid balance between the joy and the sad in life. It\'s quietly unforgettable. It\'s a shame there isn\'t more of it, but I\'m glad Hotori is what it is, and I couldn\'t ask any more from it. talk about an obscure anime, its history, his opinions on it, and its overall availability.

The music fares better though, with every usage of violins, pianos, saxophones, harps, cellos, and acoustic guitars fitting like a glove. I could probably give the soundtrack two words: Restrained and contemplative, never going overboard with trying to make you feel for the kids and their respective plights.Really, restrained and contemplative are pretty good words to describe Hotori as a whole. The movie is slow and gently paced, and the main conflict is sad, but fairly down-to-earth, with no real antagonist in sight. Since the film has a small cast of characters, and runs for about 40 minutes, it doesn\'t have a lot of time to develop them fully, which is fine. Characters like Suzu\'s nurse Usui and Hotori\'s father and brother serve their roles well, and their personalities and problems are down-to-earth and relatable, even with the sci-fi angle the movie is going for. Suzu and Hotori, the two leads, receive the most screentime and development, and the film makes great use of them, total opposites of one another, but still managing to make them interesting and relatable, showing their weaknesses and strengths and having them subtly change, from Suzu learning more about feelings and emotions to Hotori being scared of losing her memories and all that makes her herself. It also helps that the movie is pretty heavy on ""show, don\'t tell,"" relying more on body language and facial expressions to convey what the characters are feeling than relying heavily on dialogue and exposition dumping, and the gentle, low-key atmosphere of the film only elevates it, and everything else, beautifully. Even if the characters aren\'t the most three-dimensional and layered, they don\'t really feel like stock archetypes, though I wish we could have seen more of Ryou\'s parents and saw how they came to like Suzu as he is rather than just a replacement for their dead son.Now, I\'m sure people are going to take issue with the fact that a child wants her similarly-aged friend to help her commit suicide, and I can understand why. As far as I can tell, Hotori tackles the subject fairly sensitively and delicately, without relying too heavily on pointless melodrama, milking it for pathos, or treating it lightly. And don\'t worry, the film isn\'t as depressing as I\'m making it sound, as it also has a pretty nice ending that neatly resolves Suzu and Hotori\'s arcs. That being said, there are a lot of questions Hotori leaves unanswered as a result of going for that ending, but there are other questions it doesn\'t really try to answer as well: Since Suzu is a robot, is he going to stay a child forever, or will he grow up physically in some capacity? I can understand wanting to leave some things to the audience\'s imagination, but...food for thought.To quote Mr. Sevakis\' article, Hotori ~The Simple Hope for Joy~ is a pensive little jewel that reminds us of the joys of simply living, of accumulating memories. It walks a delicate line, maintaining a solid balance between the joy and the sad in life. It\'s quietly unforgettable. It\'s a shame there isn\'t more of it, but I\'m glad Hotori is what it is, and I couldn\'t ask any more from it.']"

Ibara no Ou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6610/Ibara_no_Ou,"[""Every now and then a manga well deserving of praise is adapted into a fairly mediocre anime; unfortunately King of Thorn is one of those adaptations.The source material is six volumes long; a fine length to adapt into a film, and for the most part the pacing is handled with care. King of Thorn sees a colourful cast of cryogenically frozen characters awaken to a future ravaged by monsters. The introduction is well executed; it grabs your attention and gets you wondering. As the film progresses, it becomes rather typical of the survival horror genre, but the film exhibits a certain freshness as it isn't...a genre often tackled in anime. Despite certain predictable elements, it's an enjoyable venture away from the norm. The film can't keep up the momentum, however, and the plot drops in quality nearing it's final act; it becomes more tedious than exciting as the story treads mind-boggling territory. Ultimately, the plot evens out as fairly average despite a promising opening.The animation and art is reasonably well done, but certain aspects let it down. The backgrounds and characters are drawn in a traditional anime style, but the monsters are computer generated and don't blend particularly well with the surroundings. The detail is certainly there, the monsters themselves look the part, but attempting to blend two different art styles is often going to yield fruitless results. It's something you get used to as the film progresses, but ultimately it's something that could have been handled better. The more traditionally animated elements are wonderful, however. The visuals are crisp and clear, the Scottish scenery looks beautiful and the action is well drawn and choreographed.The sound and music is probably one of the stand-out aspects of King of Thorn. The music is used appropriately and is generally impressive, as are the sounds of the monsters; sound editing is an especially crucial aspect in a survival horror, and is utilised well in King of Thorn. The music - or lack thereof at times - builds great tension and helps create an eerie, isolated atmosphere. The more upbeat tracks used during the action segments add a sufficient amount of drama and excitement.The characters - given the runtime - are fairly well developed, minus a few who are there to up the kill count; such is the nature of a survival horror. The leading lady, Kasumi, does at times come across as a little irritating and certain character motivations and actions are a little puzzling. The characters are an adequate aspect of the film, but they fail to defy convention and never leave their moulds. At times they feel unfortunately underutilised.Up until the final act, King of Thorn is an enjoyable watch, with a couple of picky elements here and there. The survival horror aspect is a welcomed change from most anime productions, but the ending is very hit-or-miss. There is merit in there - certain redeeming factors - but overall King of Thorn comes across as an enjoyable, albeit satisfactory film. a genre often tackled in anime.

Here you have a sci-fi/thriller with killer virus threatening society, survivors trying to stay alive and mysterious monsters inhabiting the area of the last set of people. It sounds good doesn't it? Science fiction happens to be one of my favourite genres of films and on paper his anime adaptation has the potential to be great, however this is one of those films that have a good idea but the way it is executed leaves a lot to be desired.The first part of the film feels...good, the characters are unique and feel likeable and the way everything unfolds again feel just right. But as the film progresses and the true nature of the story comes out one feels starts to think differently about the film and by the end you'll feel like you were robbed. My main issue with the film was the story and the art. As I stated the film starts out fine but becomes tedious because of the speed of the film and focus on unnecessary people and there will be moments where you don't know where the film is going because of the pacing. In terms of the art the characters look good and the painted background look nicely detailed and suits the locations; however there is one fatal mistake that becomes blatantly obvious in certain parts of the film and that lies in the animation. At certain points the film tends to jump into the area of 3D animation with character models that look like they are cel-shaded and the movement looks terrible. The times when it switches are easily noticeable and just look bad.The music isn't too memorable nor is it a soundtrack worthy of brilliance, it's decent enough as it adjusts to each situation and works on a whole. The characters in the films start of okay but then feel like they just be killed off because their credibility falls over time. The little boy provides humour in some places and while Kasumi feel like a likeable lass because of her shyness and care for her sister Shizuku, but through her memories and the way she acts I found her just to be a worrywart and lost interest after quite some time. In terms of how you'll enjoy the film is entirely down to your preferences really, fans of complex sci-fi films and maybe disappointed with end result purely because the film doesn't fully give you the experience that you felt that would. The feeling of loneliness, claustrophobia, isolation and danger is done well for the most part eventually it just feels tedious then exciting and thought provoking.Overall the film is something that can be watched but just doesn't feel like it gives out what it planned to. It had all the right ideas and feels good for the first part but progresses questionably and leaves you feeling robbed at the end like you were expecting more. good, the characters are unique and feel likeable and the way everything unfolds again feel just right.

If you do not mind having some sort of twisted development that leads kinda away from what seems like an obvious plot, then you can watch it. I HATE HOLES in logic, even if its ANIME FANTASY LOGIC, I enjoy tightly constructed story lines.The art was decent, good enough action scenes, but the main character, honestly I sometimes question why almost half the anime world is made of main characters like this one. (weak, self righteous, adds nothing immediately to crew but somehow manages to survive past more capable...characters) I also was more interested in HOW humanity would have cured the disease or WHO plotted it to be a bio terrorism weapon,  not like  oh let me show one character who seems to be in charge of this whole scheme, have that person monologue and then choose not to continue with life... to sum it up, if you have no idea what this is about, like me, do not expect anything because the beginning makes the story seem worth it and exciting, but it just trails into something where the end product didn't justify the time it took to watch it. The ending made me feel like the creators got tired or sick of their own story and found mediocre ways to finish it that didn't even suffice......i gave high scores for the art, the sound, and some characters, but story and plot development and character development is most important to me, and this story lacked that... its strongest element is the suspense that later proves less than satisfying, and the action/art. With so much good anime out, this falls short of its stack.Like buying a Popsicle or ice cream bar and after finishing it, you kinda are more angry with eating a below average food while wishing you spent the calories and money on something else.....maybe the manga is much better as everyone else is saying, but after watching this, I don't want to spend time reading the manga even if it is better than the anime, because how much can it possibly deviate from the manga?

The move followed the manga completely... well actually for about the first 15 minutes. Then people who were supposed to be main characters died left and right.For example the Senator dies after he finds put that Medusa will kill him and sits in a hall to rot/ petrify. some other people do die but Katherine plays a very important role in understanding what Medusa is. Tim doesn't get controlled by Alice (who is alive, and explains her story...in the manga), the main villain actually shows up to the party, and Marco does a better job of leading everyone.All of the bad plot mishaps aside anyone who has not previously known about King of thorn will think this is a solid movie, and it is. Instead of the this is what happens aspect, Sunrise decided to take a Sleeping Beauty of Anime stance on the story. Now was the story any better than what i t could have been? I don't think so, but the voice actors of the Dubbed version are awesome. The accents are spot on and the results show near perfection.The only main issue I ever saw was the flip flop of animation and CG which is disappointing. Sometimes characters would be in CG right next to hand drawns and nearly all of the monsters were in CG. I'm not looking for Redline quality but if you were to buy a DVD or Blu-Ray it would be more than noticeable and very distracting.I would always recommend this movie on the coontingency that after the movie start straight in to the manga.

I mean, just, wow. Don\'t get me wrong, my rating has nothing to do with the animation, or even the plot, since it is a good plot, but it\'s just NOT ""King of Thorn."" They should have either done A) justice to the original manga or B) made a totally different movie with different characters. Don\'t ravage such a fantastic story as ""King of Thorn,"" just don\'t DO it!It felt like, mmmm, like I started in the author\'s world, and then halfway through mad scriptwriters took over and threw in every...stupid plot twist they could possibly imagine, all while stealing ideas from Studio Ghibli. The manga series has a discernible thread that actually makes sense. Fear plays a huge role in the way Medusa works, and Alice is a crucial, note CRUCIAL, character. Not to mention the actual VILLAIN, who has been totally IGNORED in the anime!

That having an actual villain for them to beat would never work? That, perhaps, doing the manga JUSTICE by having a twelve episode anime SERIES was too much to hope for. Argh, the frustration is killing me!The only thing I like, and like is such a strong word, is having Marco and Kasumi animated.

Anilogue filmfestival is being held in Budapest and Vienna, and one of the premier movies was King of Thorn, and I managed to get my hands on a ticket ^^Now back to the review.As I mentioned first of, this was a really-really eventful movie squeezed in a very short 90 minutes.Story:...In 2015 a new virus called meduesa raises it\'s head and spreads worldwide, leaving noone alive who\'s caught by this epidemic.However a pharmaceutical company, offers 160 choosen one to be put in deep sleep, to ensure their survival, until a cure is found. But something goes wrong, very wrong.That\'s where the new story of The sleeping beuty begins.And it makes you really want to know, what is different in this story, from the fairy-tale version. The princess has a lot more role (more [and maybe someone else], than you\'d thought!! just wait until the last 75 minutes !!!), but the princes weren\'t cut out from the cast-list either...The story would had had a lot more to tell about the circimstances, and the personalities of our ""knights"", ""servants"", ""gatekeepers"", but we\'ll have to be satisfied with the adventure and the princess\' story int this short 90 minutes.Art:Sunrise Need I say more. Oh, yess!!! And I\'m not saying this, because of my approvement.The creatures were fit to be animated in CG, but, by some parts (mainly gunfights) are little crew went through a little CG-fication too, witch would had been acceptable, if it would have appeared only in gunfights, but somehow, they\'ve put some of these technical solutions in simple dialogues, and running sceens, witch was a bit irritating, that they changed from one cut to the next into a blockhead, strife-haired, bottomless-pit mouthed characters. But it didn\'t kill the atmosphere, it was just, not unnoticable.Sound:Nothing to complain here (or I might be the stick-eared one). It reale made the atmosphere, what it ment to be felt like. Maybe at the end it was a bit more fittable for a Disney film\'s summit, but it didn\'t break the pot.Character:160 -153 killed right off leaving 3 knights (a former policeman, a prisoner [lookalike], a scientist) a fool, a maid etc.As I mentioned before, they don\'t really develop, only our ""princess"", and maybe the 3rd ""knight"", maybe a bit by the ""maid"", but it\'s really regrettable that the movie was cut so short. So no big progress by the crew, manly just by the ""princess""Enjoyment:Overall, it was great, but left me there with alot of other questions in the middle of nowhere. Okay, they weren\'t so cruicial, but I would had been really curious about the ""who?""s, the ""why?""s, the ""how?""s. I really was amased by the climax (no not the flying thingy, but the ""truth"") of the movie, I\'ve almost sh*t bricks. However the film was so short, it didn\'t have the time to develop, escalate, and expand itself so, that this climax would had a really Big-Boom effect. Still this climax one of the few WTF moments of my anime history.Really good movie, but surely would had much more pontential, in a form of a 13 episodes long series.Ps.: Note me on my profile, if you find grammatic glitches in the review, please.

Thank you!', 'I must admit, at the start of this movie I was very excited. The plot held mystery and intrigue in spades and I very much wanted to see where the story led. It only took about 30 minutes for all of my hopes to slowly dissipate as... everything went wrong, slowly but surely. Amid a story with so much potential, the film kept adding twists and turns and plot in the most befuddling ways possible, turning it into a jumbled mess near the end that was comparable to watching a train wreck in slow motion.The animation was, to be fair, certainly good enough. Nothing...jawdropping, nothing eye-wateringly bad (except for certain CG parts near the end). What was unacceptable to me, though, was the absolutely awful cast of characters. In the English dub, the small child character was grating to the point of insanity, and many other characters barely served any function at all besides to artificially add tension to a scene with throw-away lines that establish vague identities and not much else.In summation: this movie is a fever dream that I am glad I woke up from.

Do not watch.', 'Story: 9Honestly, I really loved this movie. It had me immersed from the first minute to the last, and while I can understand why some people dislike it over its ""lack of logic,"" I don\'t agree. For the first half, or even first 3/4 of the film, it seems rather realistic, almost as if it could be an alternate reality to our own. Undeniably, it takes an unanticipated twist at that point--and one that I felt personally bumped my overall enjoyment of the film from an 8 to a 10--there was no doubt in my mind that the change of pace was, for my taste,...a positive. With that said, I\'m going to keep this review spoiler free, so that\'s about as far as my review of the story itself goes--I decided on a 9 for this section, just because the very beginning starts off a bit too slow for me, despite it being the general establishing opening.Art: 8I am NOT a fan of CGI, and this movie depends heavily on it. However, for the most part (aside from some of the cringy monsters), I really didn\'t mind it when applied to the scenes and even the characters. The speed of the action blurred the 3D models almost enough to make the CGI undetectable, if you aren\'t an enemy of it (like me), and it was certainly better than the usual MMD standard.Otherwise, the hand drawn artstyle was somewhat generic, but definitely not something that negatively impacted the experience.Sound: 10I think that the soundtrack of this movie was picked perfectly. There are times, especially in flashbacks and in the conclusion of the film, that the outside noise is nearly or entirely muted, and the beautiful music has a moment to take over. Is it something most of us would listen to all by itself? Probably not. But it fit the scenes so while that doesn\'t even matter to me.Character: 9While there isn\'t anything extraordinarily spectacular about the cast, I really appreciated its diversity. At first glance, one might point the seven mains out as archetypes, but as the story progresses we learn that they REALLY aren\'t. The development is done well, even if it turns pretty entropic towards the end, and I wasn\'t left feeling like any of the character were familiar cookie cutters I\'d seen before. All that having been said, working with seven characters does mean that certain ones were given, if not more screen time in this case, more attention. And THAT having been said, this extra attention was done somewhat subtly and I\'d say was rather acceptable given the survivability of each character in the end (lol sorry I\'m not trying to sound all weirdly sophisticated, I\'m just trying my hardest not to spoil those major plot points).Enjoyment: 10 (see Story for why...sorry I got lazy and need a snack)Overall: 10 a positive.

At first glance, one might point the seven mains out as archetypes, but as the story progresses we learn that they REALLY aren\'t. The development is done well, even if it turns pretty entropic towards the end, and I wasn\'t left feeling like any of the character were familiar cookie cutters I\'d seen before. All that having been said, working with seven characters does mean that certain ones were given, if not more screen time in this case, more attention. And THAT having been said, this extra attention was done somewhat subtly and I\'d say was rather acceptable given the survivability of each character in the end (lol sorry I\'m not trying to sound all weirdly sophisticated, I\'m just trying my hardest not to spoil those major plot points).Enjoyment: 10 (see Story for why...sorry I got lazy and need a snack)Overall: 10', 'Everyone loves a good fairy tail, and most fairy tails often have darker origins than what anyone would suspect. This movie goes dark with a fairy tail back drop that tackles some interesting ideas but doesn\'t have the proper time to explore them thoroughly enough.*WARNING, this review is from the perspective of someone who has not read the original manga.*STORY: Mass disease is a damn frightening thought, no doubts about that. But one that turns you to stone? Oh shit! Talk about being ""stoned to death.""..................................................................................Ahem, anyways King of Thorns is a 110 minute movie made by Sunrise based on a manga series of the...same name. And I\'ll go ahead and be honest and say that I really enjoyed myself with this movie, or rather I enjoyed thinking about what ideas this movie offered.It begins with a mass media coverage of a virus called Medusa causing people to turn to stone in a mere 12 days, easily setting in a sense of dread for just about everyone in the world. While others will die eventually, a select group of people will be put into a cryogenic sleep at a castle like structure with the hope of a world cured of Medusa. Unfortunately they wake up prematurely to a new nightmare.King of Thorns mostly works as a B-grade horror survival flick with some sci-fi properties. Many horrific beasts kill and slaughter the vast majority of the people that were asleep, leaving only a select few to fend against the monsters and escape from the castle.The people among the survivors are as followed; Kasumi Ishiki, the main character of this movie and a shy and timid bespectacled young girl who lost her parents to Medusa leaving her and her twin sister to care for their selves. Marco Owen, your action super star and a criminal who won his way in through chance to be among those who will be in cryogenic sleep and knows more about what\'s going on than he\'s letting on. Ron Portman, an american police officer who also will be constantly bickering with his opposite on the justice system. Timothy Laisenbach, a young boy who can\'t help but to compare their dangerous situation to a video game he played. Katherine Turner, a woman who treats Timothy as her own child as he reminds her of her own child while providing the fairy tail back drop for this dark tale and several others that die soon after the massacre. Each of these characters have their own reasons for surviving, some more so than others, but each has their own compelling story behind them. Or at least I would think so...The major problem with King of Thorns is a simple one: The lack of sufficient time. The lack of time to thoroughly explain certain plot points. The lack of time to put more development into the main group of characters, save for Kasumi and Marco, they get the bulk of the character development and screen time. And the lack of time put into details about certain plot points that will be left hanging. Surely what time it has is used as well as it could have been used, with the plot never derailing from it\'s focus or never stopping the pace to show decent action scenes, but this movie would have benefited more by being adapted into a 12 episode series instead.Which leads into my second biggest grip about this movie, certain scenes were made in a way to prepare for the story\'s strongest point, a plot twist. Said plot twist makes this movies plot points tie into something unexpected but at the same time not something that was pulled out of no where making it plausible within the context of the film and not wasting any of the setups. Mainly because this movie makes sure you will see where all of it\'s scenes lead to, by practicably bashing your head in with hints and information. You will still need to pay attention without a doubt, but the lead up works like a double edged sword, making you anxious for what\'s to come and irritating you by making sure you see it coming and reminding you constantly.There are some other nit picks I have with this movie (Like how Marco is a pro at doing the impossible), but the ideas and the plot twist at the end makes this a movie one I\'d recommend, for at least the interesting ideas it comes up with.ANIMATION: With Sunrise in charge of production, you can expect some nicely done and consistent animation with some really bad forced in 3D animation as well. The 3D parts are completely unneeded and will only take you out of the movie if it annoys you as much as it did me. The character design are good and well diverse, as diverse the world\'s population (Fortunately with a male teenager absent, we have more than enough of those in anime anyway).SOUND: The background music is used effectively, and works wonders with the fairy tail back drop the story uses. While I didn\'t listen to the Japanese audio, I watched the new english dub by Funimation and they did solid job for the most part. While Brina Palencia does wonders for role as Kasumi with Patrick Seitz not falling behind her as Marco, Bob Carter is probably the weakest link in a dub that is filled with some awkward accents.OVERALL:The Mixed:+/- Interesting ideas within. / Doesn\'t spend much time with needed explanations on certain plot details.+/- Decent cast of characters. / Only the main leads get the most attention.+/- Great plot twist at the end. / Practicably holds your hand and guides you to it by constantly remaining you how it gets there in the first place.+/- Good english dub. / Dub is filled with accents that aren\'t particularly great.+/- Good animation. / 3D animation that is obviously used to save on production.The Bad:- Marco performs the impossible on a regular basis.I\'d honestly would rather have a zombie apocalypse than face a crisis that can wipe out the human race, because at least we\'re ready for that since we get remained of how to act in a situation like that with all of the movies remaining us how not to act.

It's a film that unravels it's mysteries bit by bit without giving it all away.Story: This is an unabashed survival horror title, it's got the genre's tropes down to a fine art, a facility over-run with thorns and weird creatures that attack survivors. But what's really great about the story of this movie is...that they keep unraveling mysteries as time goes on, the revealing of these mysteries are done perfectly and they mix these well with the action sequences so that your not sitting around listening to someone explain everything and boring you to death. The only real problem with the story is that near the end it becomes incredibly confusing and you have no idea what is real and what is not.Art: I want to make it clear the reason this gets a low grade is not because of the  absolutely beautiful 2D animation and backgrounds, it gets it because of some really really shitty 3D Animation, There is no reason to have the human beings become 3D out of nowhere and then suddenly shift to 2D, it looks jarring and out of place. This is what really brings down the movie in my opinion, if they kept it to completely 2D, this would probably be a near masterpiece, instead it really harms the movie.Sound: I watched this on English Dub, there are accents for all the characters except for Kasumi, Shizuka, Peter and Ron. The accents are perfect and are not out of place or take away from the story. Though at times I felt R Bruce Elliott's Italian accent slipped a little into Russian, however that's not as much of a big concern if you've watched the movie. The music on the other hand for this title is incredible, anytime a title makes you want to look up who did the scoring for it, you know you have good music. Toshihiko Sahashi did an incredible job with this soundtrack and payed great attention to detail with it, he included a little scottish flair paying homage to the locale of the Story.Character: I really love the Characters in this story, when you have a film that makes you care about the characters and what happens to them, You generally want to see these characters survive the hell they have found themselves in. I really would like to go in depth on this but I'm not very eloquent when it comes to talking about other people. I think what I really like about this film is the character development regarding Marco, when you first see him you honestly think this man is an complete asshole but over time you really start to learn he is a flesh and blood human being like the rest of us and that he too carries around wounds of the heart.Enjoyment: I absolutely loved this movie, I think I could definitely watch it again, if the animation could have just been fixed as well the ending just a tiny bit this may be one of the best Anime Films to have ever been made, I know I won't forget this movie.Overall: King of Thorn has it's flaws, but it has some of the most beautiful 2D Animation and Music you will experience in your life. that they keep unraveling mysteries as time goes on, the revealing of these mysteries are done perfectly and they mix these well with the action sequences so that your not sitting around listening to someone explain everything and boring you to death.

Then i realized that out of all the movies/television shows that i have seen this has got to be one of the greatest i have ever seen!While there\'s some strong overlap here, the difference is that King of Thorn strikes me as a lot smarter. Or maybe it isn\'t really, and that\'s just my perception. Maybe I\'m just overly impressed with the references to classical mythology and the psychological import of fairy tales (""Sleeping Beauty"" plays a key part in the plot and imagery). More likely, I can\'t help noticing that while Pandorum starts...sharp and gets more conventional on its way to its twist ending, King of Thorn gets decidedly brainier as it progresses to its impressive twist-upon-twist ending. (much like that of the movie inception)Better still, nothing from the early parts of the film is ultimately meaningless, which helps redeem passages that at the time might seem random or precious. The weird yet intense relationship between a pair of twins, the usual assortment of character types thrown together (cute child, hunky bad boy, ext.), the overall trippiness of the setting/mood when they first wake up--all of it signifies something, and the end result is a conclusion which is strangely satisfying. sharp and gets more conventional on its way to its twist ending, King of Thorn gets decidedly brainier as it progresses to its impressive twist-upon-twist ending.

A lot of game and film companies try to have unique ideas for a survivor horror tale and most of them are hit and miss. The original manga King Of Thorn was a surprise hit and while it didn't perfect the genre, it did leave an impression to manga readers with it's compelling characters, crazy storyline and moments of true tension. Now the animators at Sunrise (Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, Freedom and Steamboy) release their film adaptation to King Of Thorn. Now before I go on, I never read the manga (I'm not really a huge...fan of mangas) but I will try my best with details that were changed in the movie.The premise and ideas of King Of Thorn are incredibly unique but the problem is that the movie took a lot liberties with the material of the manga. They scrapped the backstories of the characters, the main antagonist Zeus did not appear in the movie and the ending was completely changed from the original story. For example in the manga, one survivor named Tim is a little boy who is mature and quite usable for the team but in the anime, he's a video game JRPG addict and HE'S COMPLETELY USELESS! These changes were just awful and really ruined the characters for me (minus the sisters though). We're talking about 7 people who must risk their own life to survive a place where thorns, a non-curable killer virus and monsters take over the place and what the writer did is scrap the emotional backstories of ALL characters. Also, important characters like Alice and Zeus were never used in the film since they did provide important story aspects in the original mangas. So yes, the changes to the characters and stories were inexcusable, they could have made this into a 3 hour anime film to provide us with emotional weight that these characters go through, character backstories and much story as possible. Overall, it makes the story convoluted as hell that it's too hard to appreciate the ideas that it offers for the viewers.The animation by Sunrise is hit and miss. When it shines, it's in the 2D animation department. The detail is great, coloring and backgrounds look fluid look wonderful and the character models are nicely drawn well and on the miss, it's the 3D CG animation. My god... Why? It looked horrible and the monsters in CG form looked like they popped out of a PS2 game. Hell, the character models in CGi look very ridiculous. I think the reason for this is that Sunrise had a low budget to make this movie and they incorporated CG to save up some money for the marketing. Next time Sunrise, balance out the budget so that this doesn't happen again. For all my problems I have with this movie, does it make it awful? Of course not. There are a few positives I had with the movie. The sisters were handled very well in the movie and you do feel sorry for them for what they go thorugh and Kasumi goes through more hell than anyone can ever imagined. i also love the scenes with lots of tension and gore and the dubbing by Funimation was not that bad. Brina Palencia was perfect for the role as Kasumi giving that vulnerable side to the character and Patrick Seitz was convincing as Marco and the whole cast did a solid job on their perspective roles. Although the accents of each character can be laughably bad at some points.If you're interested in seeing this, you might like this one as I did cause to be fair, it offers some great relationship moments with the twin sisters, great moments of tension and a nice dub provided by Funimation. However if your a fan of the King Of Thorn mangas, be very cautious with this one as it changes everything about the mangas including the backstory of all characters.

It actually IS very, very good, but only in the beginning. Or, let's say, throughout the first half of the movie. Then it gets unnecessarily complicated - I still don't get everything. It would've...been perfectly fine if they would've left out some of those many, too many twists. But there are also many enjoyable moments that caught me off guard. You know these moments when you think, okay, it cannot get any worse than this - and suddenly it gets MUCH worse? This movie is full of it, and THAT I liked.ART:The art is very fluent and enjoyable.

It wonderfully mixes with the dark setting, leaves a bittersweet taste. Simply beautiful.CHARACTER:The characters all have their own surprising little secrets, which sooner or later are revealed.

Does this unique combination of an old children's tale and a modern horror show, of psychology and fantasy, of action and thrill deliver on its premise? Yes and no. While highly action-packed for...the most part and entertaining and interesting throughout its entirety, King of Thorn does suffer from some massive flaws that unfortunately drag down the score of what might have been a benchmark creation for the survival horror genre. Does that mean that the movie is bad? Definitely not, and while far from perfect, it's still a very enjoyable flick with relatively high rewatchability and certainly one of the better ones in its genre.King of Thorn is an adaptation of the 37-chapter manga of the same name by Yuji Iwahara. The film adaptation takes many liberties with the original material, but I'll do my best to keep the comparisons with the manga at minimum, and judge the movie on its own merits.Sunrise, an old and established studio that has produced a multitude of different shows over the course of its 40 years long history ( shows like Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam SEED, Visions of Escaflowne, both seasons of Code Geass and the legendary Cowboy Bebop ) brings us this on-the-edge-of-your-seat thrill ride about deadly viruses and fantastic monsters, all to the background of a sci-fi research facility located underneath an enchanting and enthralling Scottish castle.Every background is highly detailed and there are several set pieces that are just jaw-droppingly gorgeous in their size, content, detail, superb colouring and they really leave a strong impression of being crafted with a lot of effort and care. Machinery inside the research facility and the architecture of the castle in which it is situated are meticulously drawn to the tiniest minutiae, giving it a believable and realistic look that manages to immerse the viewer into the story superbly. Particularly praise-worthy are the few short scenes set in New York City and a couple of shots of a deserted Scottish town, both of them at the beginning of the movie, and it's scenes like these that show just how much effort was put into it by the art department. Rather than being some generic depictions of how an average Japanese might perceive them to look like, streets of New York are incredibly realistic and detailed, with several examples of real-life architecture to complement more random but still very faithful art-deco and modernist buildings. And it's not just the architecture that's detailed and realistic; clothing, vehicles, even the railings surrounding the entrance to a subway station are crafted carefully to enhance the realism of the setting and make it as convincing as possible. Same goes for the Scottish village and countryside, which are featured for less then a minute, but the attention to architectural styles, shop fronts and signage is on the same fantastic level. The camera angles, shading and colouring are also excellent, making the visual experience cold, gloomy and ominous, and effectively conveying the sense of an impending doom that permeates the majority of the story, while still not sacrificing any of the realism by going overboard in any of these areas.The character designs are very good too, well-coloured, realistic and aesthetically pleasing; some of them like Marco ( with his extensive tattoos ) are even quite memorable. While they are far less detailed than the surroundings in which they move, the contrast between the character models and the backgrounds isn't that jarring, and the 2D elements all blend extremely well with each other.As previously said, the art direction, backgrounds, character designs and even the cinematography are all top-notch, but the animation itself is a very mixed bag and this significantly lowers the overall visual quality of the movie.The traditional 2D animation that is present throughout most of the movie is nothing spectacular, but it's still of high quality and very fluid, and there is hardly any cases of it going off-model. However, for some reason, the studio decided to render most of the monsters, and occasionally the characters as well, in 3D. The CGI models themselves are actually pretty good; they mostly move naturally and are quite detailed and well-shaded, but the contrast between the 3D CGI models and traditional 2D characters and backgrounds is so obvious, irritating and stark that it damages the viewing experience during those scenes. Some of the vehicles are also computer-generated and clash with the setting almost as strongly as the monsters.The problems in blending the 3D animation with the 2D backgrounds and character models are not easy to overlook and thus the visuals fail to get a perfect score, despite being overall very impressive, which is a great shame.The music, composed by the experienced Toshihiko Sahashi ( Full Metal Panic!, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED ), compliments the visuals well and even though it may not win any awards, it's still pretty well-written and well-used. The highlight of the soundtrack is the untitled main theme, featuring a beautiful combination of powerful, haunting and melancholic vocals accompanied by great instrumental performances on the strings and the flute. A very touching and emotional piece, it fits the general atmosphere and the underlying story perfectly. Other tracks are mostly instrumental and vocal variations to this main theme, with an odd electronic piece or an organ thrown in here and there. The ending credits song “Edge of This World“, written specifically for the movie, was performed by the popular Japanese singer Misia. The song is also a stand-out, along with the aforementioned main theme, and its lyrics are very fitting and poignant, a refreshing change from the practice to just put something that fits the movie or show tonally with little regard for the actual content. Overall, the music was very good and the quality of the tracks made up for the lack of diversity.Unfortunately, I cannot discuss the qualities of the dub as opposed to the subbed version, since the movie was only localised by Funimation a few months prior to the writing of this review and I haven't had the chance to watch the English version. What I will mention is that the director of the English dub made a wise choice of using various ethnic accents for the diverse cast of characters, from British ( Marco ) to Italian ( for the corrupt senator who manages to survive the initial slaughter ). The Japanese seiyuu did a very good job at portraying their respective characters and the vast emotional stress that they have to go through. Whether you prefer the English or the Japanese version, you won't be let down.Sadly, as much as I'd like to say that the story of King of Thorn is on the same high level as the technical aspects of the movie, I simply can't. There are some major problems with the execution of the story, and these problems largely stem from the limited running time; the movie doesn't have enough time to adequately cover all the plot points and finish the plot threads while still leaving an appropriate amount of time for the revelations and emotional impacts to properly sit in for both the audience and the characters.Adapting a 37 chapter long manga into a 105 minute feature is no small feat, and even though the writers decided to narrow down the focus of the movie by dropping some of the subplots and characters from the original manga, I still believe it would have been better had Sunrise opted for a 10-12 episode long TV show or an OVA series, even with the narrower focus of the anime adaptation. The more personal and emotional nature of the adapted story still needs time to unravel naturally and the audience needs time to allow for the drama to sink in, and the movie would have really benefited immensely if it had at least additional twenty or so minutes of running time.The plot can be roughly split into four acts, each act about 25 minutes long; the first act covers the initial outbreak of the Medusa virus which causes worldwide panic as the national and international organisations are powerless in the face of this deadly and extremely mysterious pandemic. A private corporation comes forth with a solution: they have managed to master the science of cryogenic suspension ( which they call “Cold sleep“ ) that will allow 160 lucky individuals to remain alive and safe from the virus until a cure can be found. The first act ends when the members of this “Noah's Arc“ are put to sleep. This first part is very well executed, managing to provide a large amount of exposition very naturally, mostly through a montage of television reports dealing with the outbreak and spreading of Medusa. The viewers are also introduced to the main cast of characters and everything is set for the second act in which the sleepers awake to find out that the world has ended. Or so it appears.The main problems of the movie and the principle flaws in the story-telling are present in the second and third act. By the end of the second act most of the 160 people that were put to sleep have been killed by the strange monsters roaming the castle that has in the meantime been covered in huge thorns. It is inferred that the noble motivations of the corporation that initiated the project weren't so noble after all, and during the third act the truth behind the Medusa virus is finally revealed and the remaining survivors manage to escape the thorny prison of the huge castle. These two arcs are extremely fast-paced giving no time for breathers neither for its characters as they run away from monsters while trying to find their way out of the maze of the underground complex and the castle's dungeons, nor for the audience that has to connect all the plot points and grasp the situation after several info-dumps which are extremely confusing on the first watching. Needless to say, this part of the movie puts a huge strain on the audience as it jumps from tense action scenes to the expository dialogue/monologue dealing with the backgrounds of some of the characters and the mysteries behind the current apocalypse, both of which are in turn regularly interrupted by the the main character Kasumi's flashbacks that gradually reveal her relationship with her twin sister, Shizuku.There's a lot of good stuff in this part of the story, primarily the development of Kazumi's character and the relationship between the two sisters, which turns out to be the main underlying plot thread around which everything else revolves. The background and the nature of the deadly Medusa virus is also very interesting and thought-provoking, even if the idea was already explored in some other sci-fi works [ sort of SPOILER ALERT], the best example being the 1998 psychological thriller “Sphere“ [END OF SPOILER].As I said, every minute of the movie is very entertaining and attention-grabbing, however, the fast pace and condensed story come with a heavy price. Those unfamiliar with the original manga will have a hard time digesting the revelations and the main plot twist, partially because they could have been worded a bit better and partially because the movie gives the viewer no time to digest the data before hurrying to move your attention to the next action scene in which the characters fight for their lives. The plot also suffers from numerous contrivances and the revelations can feel pretty convoluted, revealing potential plot-holes under the closer look.Character development is yet another victim that falls prey to the inadequate running time. The main cast consists of seven survivors of the initial onslaught. Apart from Kasumi and the ruffian Marco, who get the majority of screen time and are very well developed ( especially Kasumi ), the rest receive minimal character development. That is not to say that they are just cardboard cut-outs or plot devices. Even though they might not be very developed as characters, they all have personalities and feel and act like real people. Some of the characters had their backstories from the manga scrapped, but their backgrounds are still at least hinted at, and given the screen time they get and the fast paced nature of the story, character development was handled as best as possible.The real gold of the story, though, comes in the final, climactic arc, where the last, underlying plot line is finally resolved in a surprising, but ingenious and satisfying manner.King of Thorn draws the parallels between its story and the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty from the very start. In the hands of a less competent writer, this would just be a pretentious and futile attempt to add depth to a story centred around graphic violence and cheap thrills, but King of Thorn actually makes these parallels and comparisons meaningful and relevant to the story it's telling. As already mentioned, the anime adaptation did away with some of the plot lines and characters from the manga in order to focus on the relationship between Kasumi and her twin sister Shizuku, and it can be safely said that this was a very good decision that raised the overall quality of the film. Their story is well written and well presented, slowly building up towards the climactic finale, and it toys with the questions about true feelings and wishes of the Princess from the original fairy tale. Unfortunately, this beautiful and touching story has to carry around with it the baggage of the survival horror story that it's tied to. I believe it would have been wiser had the writers decided to take even more liberties with the original material; once they decided to significantly alter the original, they should have gotten rid of all the elements that weren't completely necessary for the central story of the two sisters. Namely, the “survival“ element of the horror story should have been toned down to the barest minimum, with the story focusing even more on the psychological effects of the catastrophe that has befallen the castle and the world. Nevertheless, the underlying narrative and its parallels with the tale of Sleeping Beauty are definitely the strongest and best executed part of the story and they make the movie stand out among the other works in its respective genre.Ultimately, King of Thorn is a good movie. Not a great or a perfect movie, but a good one none the less. The personal nature of the underlying story and some very intriguing themes and concepts that it brings up make it distinctive and certainly much, much better than other anime horror shows like Highschool of the Dead. It's a very mature and serious film that never stoops low to please the lowest common denominator. The action scenes are tense, entertaining and occasionally very gory but never gratuitous. While nothing spectacular in terms of animation, it features some gorgeous artwork and beautiful music that greatly add to the viewing experience. What prevents it from getting a higher score are the horribly used 3D CGI models, extremely fast pace for the largest part of the movie and the numerous contrivances and convoluted plot points. Combined, they make the story less enjoyable on the first watching and can unnerve the less resilient viewers to the point where the good stuff ( namely the Kasumi-Shizuku relationship ) just flies over their heads, making some of the plot twist feel more like something from M. Night Shyamalan's kitchen ( although he can only wish to create plot twists this convincing ).Overall, 7,1/10. the most part and entertaining and interesting throughout its entirety, King of Thorn does suffer from some massive flaws that unfortunately drag down the score of what might have been a benchmark creation for the survival horror genre. Does that mean that the movie is bad? Definitely not, and while far from perfect, it's still a very enjoyable flick with relatively high rewatchability and certainly one of the better ones in its genre.King of Thorn is an adaptation of the 37-chapter manga of the same name by Yuji Iwahara. The film adaptation takes many liberties with the original material, but I'll do my best to keep the comparisons with the manga at minimum, and judge the movie on its own merits.Sunrise, an old and established studio that has produced a multitude of different shows over the course of its 40 years long history ( shows like Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam SEED, Visions of Escaflowne, both seasons of Code Geass and the legendary Cowboy Bebop ) brings us this on-the-edge-of-your-seat thrill ride about deadly viruses and fantastic monsters, all to the background of a sci-fi research facility located underneath an enchanting and enthralling Scottish castle.Every background is highly detailed and there are several set pieces that are just jaw-droppingly gorgeous in their size, content, detail, superb colouring and they really leave a strong impression of being crafted with a lot of effort and care. Machinery inside the research facility and the architecture of the castle in which it is situated are meticulously drawn to the tiniest minutiae, giving it a believable and realistic look that manages to immerse the viewer into the story superbly. Particularly praise-worthy are the few short scenes set in New York City and a couple of shots of a deserted Scottish town, both of them at the beginning of the movie, and it's scenes like these that show just how much effort was put into it by the art department. Rather than being some generic depictions of how an average Japanese might perceive them to look like, streets of New York are incredibly realistic and detailed, with several examples of real-life architecture to complement more random but still very faithful art-deco and modernist buildings. And it's not just the architecture that's detailed and realistic; clothing, vehicles, even the railings surrounding the entrance to a subway station are crafted carefully to enhance the realism of the setting and make it as convincing as possible. Same goes for the Scottish village and countryside, which are featured for less then a minute, but the attention to architectural styles, shop fronts and signage is on the same fantastic level. The camera angles, shading and colouring are also excellent, making the visual experience cold, gloomy and ominous, and effectively conveying the sense of an impending doom that permeates the majority of the story, while still not sacrificing any of the realism by going overboard in any of these areas.The character designs are very good too, well-coloured, realistic and aesthetically pleasing; some of them like Marco ( with his extensive tattoos ) are even quite memorable. While they are far less detailed than the surroundings in which they move, the contrast between the character models and the backgrounds isn't that jarring, and the 2D elements all blend extremely well with each other.As previously said, the art direction, backgrounds, character designs and even the cinematography are all top-notch, but the animation itself is a very mixed bag and this significantly lowers the overall visual quality of the movie.The traditional 2D animation that is present throughout most of the movie is nothing spectacular, but it's still of high quality and very fluid, and there is hardly any cases of it going off-model.

The highlight of the soundtrack is the untitled main theme, featuring a beautiful combination of powerful, haunting and melancholic vocals accompanied by great instrumental performances on the strings and the flute. A very touching and emotional piece, it fits the general atmosphere and the underlying story perfectly. Other tracks are mostly instrumental and vocal variations to this main theme, with an odd electronic piece or an organ thrown in here and there.

I'll touch on a few points as to why;First, I have not read the manga so I have no point of reference in that regard. So from that standpoint this is a really good standalone movie that is done very well in a lot of ways, and I think it is unfair to compare the two as written material versus any kind of visual adaptation are often very different for a variety of reasons not the least of which is that many things that can come across great in a novel (or...manga, as the case may be) do not do so well when translated into a visual format like a movie so many times changes do have to be made.Second, I actually liked that there was a mix of the traditional anime style and the CGI monsters. Other animes have pulled this off in spectacular fashion, and I think it was done so very well here. It made the things from one part stand out from things in another part.Third, while the story was confusing and it may be worth reading the manga to get the full version I think for what it was it was told well. I was very surprised at the ending that I absolutely did not see coming, and at the end I kind of had to do a run through in my head to recount the movie and realize how it all ties together. In that particular aspect it's worth watching at least twice for that alone, to notice the little things you didn't the first time with the information at the end at hand.Finally, overall I thought this was wonderful. A great adaptation of a classic fairy tale with a little bit of a sci-fi element to it and a twisting flair that isn't found much these days. If you read the manga chances are you won't like this, but if you haven't then it's worth the watch because with nothing to compare it to I sincerely think this was great. manga, as the case may be) do not do so well when translated into a visual format like a movie so many times changes do have to be made.Second, I actually liked that there was a mix of the traditional anime style and the CGI monsters.

King of Thorn depicts a survival/ horror like story where several people put under cryogenic sleep due to being infected by a virus awaken to discover the institution they are at is covered in spiked thorns and swarming with violent monsters. On the plotting end, the series is effective for the most part in slowly building up its mystery surrounding what exactly is going on when Kasumi and the others awaken at the institution. Hints are scattered throughout the movie concerning what happened with some characters having hidden motives for their actions, some good and others are not...so much. Some characters are fleshed out in exploring their pasts with their past traumas having a role to play in later events of the series, especially in the case of Kasumi when the shocking truth surrounding the origins of the virus and activity in the institution are revealed.What does hurt the movie for me to a good extent is the pacing. The movie's events fly by a quick pace, which prevent any dramatic or suspenseful moments from encounters with the monsters or revelations from having time to sink in and allow for the maximum emotional impact to be felt by the viewers. In addition, some of the prominent characters in King of Thorn felt rather underdeveloped as either they had little depth or weren't given enough depth to allow me to connect with them fully. Also be warned, this movie can get quite violent at points as a number of characters die in very bloody ways thanks to the monsters they encounter.The visuals for King of Thorn were also a bit of a mixed bag for me. The regular animation had a great amount of visual detail put into scenery and character designs, with subdued color tones going along well with the tense mood the movie wanted to give off. On the other hand, the CG animation used in the movie, while fluid in action scenes, sticks out like a sore thumb in many instances in its rendering of vehicles, the various monsters and even the characters during action sequences for some odd reason. In the case of characters, their rendering looked quite rough compared to their regular designs and were not as well-detailed.But while having its issues with animation and pacing, King of Thorn is still a solid movie worth killing two hours to watch through thanks to its plot buildup concerning what led to the institution inhabited by Kasumi and others to become a hellish place they have to survive through. so much.

Somebody tries to invent a countermeasure for it, but things do not really go as expected.I have not read the manga, but from anime perspective alone it is a very solid horror/action movie, that becomes more dream-like and surreal as it goes on. Music is great, and shines in situations where the anime doesn't try to make characters talk. I would say it resembled me Gyo, in its atmosphere.Detailed breakdown below.Story: 6/10The story has weak...points when the anime stops action and lets character interact with each other. Character interaction is a bit awkward and is not that believable. IT also spends plenty of time setting up the events into full motion, but once it is done with talking parts it becomes more and more surreal and symbolic, acquires a bit of dream-like atmosphere and greatly enjoyable. I really liked later half of the moive.Art: 7/10Highly detailed backgrounds and fairly solid overall, however, there instances where certain creatures are done using CG, and it is noticeable. Basically, CG is not horrible, but it doesn't perfectly blend with hand-drawn parts, like it was done, for example, in Seikai Suru Kado or Sidonia no Kishi. So, the CG parts stand out. Having said that, realistic character proportions and decent amount of detail help a lot.Sound: 7/10:Some wonderful and fitting music in the later half of the anime, which contributes to the atmosphere.Character: 5/10:In the 2 hour time window there's not much time for proper character development, and in situations where characters do interact with each other it is not really convincing. It is not really horrible, but it isn't that well done, and this anime works better when characters are going somewhere, running for something, etc. I.e. during movement/action parts.Enjoyement: 7/10:I liked it. It started as a decent anime with some action and horror, and in later segment it became enjoyable due to more surreal atmospehre.Overall: 7/10:Definitely worth a watch. There are very brutal scenes, but it doesn't try to go over the top with on-screen gore, like some titles do. The atmosphere is interesting, and enjoyable, and in conjuction with nice music, later halves turned out to be very enjoyable.I definitely recommend watching it. points when the anime stops action and lets character interact with each other.

Basically, CG is not horrible, but it doesn't perfectly blend with hand-drawn parts, like it was done, for example, in Seikai Suru Kado or Sidonia no Kishi. So, the CG parts stand out. Having said that, realistic character proportions and decent amount of detail help a lot.Sound: 7/10:Some wonderful and fitting music in the later half of the anime, which contributes to the atmosphere.Character: 5/10:In the 2 hour time window there's not much time for proper character development, and in situations where characters do interact with each other it is not really convincing. It is not really horrible, but it isn't that well done, and this anime works better when characters are going somewhere, running for something, etc. I.e. during movement/action parts.Enjoyement: 7/10:I liked it. It started as a decent anime with some action and horror, and in later segment it became enjoyable due to more surreal atmospehre.Overall: 7/10:Definitely worth a watch. There are very brutal scenes, but it doesn't try to go over the top with on-screen gore, like some titles do. The atmosphere is interesting, and enjoyable, and in conjuction with nice music, later halves turned out to be very enjoyable.I definitely recommend watching it."", ""When i started to watch Ibara no Ou i didn't really have any expectations expect the fact that i probably going to like it.

The story started really great at the beginning but at some point in the halfway it didn't really go the way i was expecting and that somewhat turned me off. The story about how everything happened was for me somehow really rushed off.

Characters were too naive and the ending 30min felt rushed, main characters died with no shock factor. Would have been better in a 13 episode series but works well in a film format. Interesting reference ""Miracles don\'t happen without wishes"" ties into the plot...Notes while watching:Spoilers****plot seems interesting, the film begins with a lotof promise an outbreakleading to a seemingly worldwide apocalypse....Little too many unnecessary flashbacks.characters are so naive, e.g Kasumi is screaming her headoff to the developer yet he says nothing and dies.They could have both lived if he told her to shut upconsidering the creatures sense based on sound, surelymoving away from the source of the sound should be enoughto avoid being captured.Inconsistent mechanics, creatures are attracted to soundyet still chase characters running that aren\'t making anysound.ORcharacters know the creatures detect based on sound aloneLOL the blonde female character literally shouts ""BOY""in front of the f*cking creature.

The first half is top-notch stuff, with a phenomenal set-up and an even better follow through, but the second half gets a bit bogged down in nonsensical exposition and an attempt to make the film more profound than it needed to be, resulting in some convoluted and muddled plot threads.To clarify though, things never get too confusing not to be able to follow, but the first two-thirds of the film are so straight-forward and well executed that I didn\'t feel like it needed to go in the direction it did. This...would have been better off as a ""dumb"" genre flick instead of trying to be intellectual, and considering no one is complaining about anime classics like Ninja Scroll and Vampire Hunter D being true to what they are, this would have been fine going that route as well. Not everything has to aspire to be Ghost in the Shell. I would have probably rated this higher if it had a different final act, but it\'s certainly not a deal-breaker, and is still well worth checking out. would have been better off as a ""dumb"" genre flick instead of trying to be intellectual, and considering no one is complaining about anime classics like Ninja Scroll and Vampire Hunter D being true to what they are, this would have been fine going that route as well.

Not only it always comes with the too much thrill of staying alive while fighting monsters or staying sane amidst the confusion but it always has that mysterious and twisted plot that will reveal at the end of the story.The story was about a set of people who were bewildered by what they saw around them after waking up in a supposed long sleep. They didn’t had enough time to think because they had to stay alive from the mysterious monsters that...lurked around the facility they were kept. Not only they had to survive but they also had to figure out what happened to the world while they were asleep and just how long they’ve been sleeping.This movie exceeded what I was expecting from it. It’s not just a survival type of story that has a mysterious and twisted plot but it has a strong psychological touch which revealed at the end of the movie. You will be confused and puzzled after every revelation and so you really have to finish it to really understand the whole storyline.The animation was superb which to be expected considering it was done so recently. Accompanied with a nice soundtrack, this movie was definitely worth to watch. lurked around the facility they were kept.

That\'s the premise, and that\'s where it will all go bad.It\'s a psychological action/thriller survival horror with a spice of philosophy and adventure Anime. Hard to say much about it without spoiling, so I will only tell few general reactions and thoughts I had.I found the story my cup of tea. Meaning that it was ""edgy"" enough for...me and feeling of ""thought provocation"" was great. I found a start a bit boring yet intriguing, then after everyone went for a sleep, I thought ""eh, now rest of the movie will be their adventure of survival and getting out of the facility alive"". But in fact, it was much more than that, characters were irrelevant to select few and as progression went on, it became more and more difficult to keep track on. It went more eerie, intense and to a certain degree, quite spooky. But as someone who watches/plays/read or ""concept of understanding"" is to simply soak in things as I get and simply feel them. Rather than propose questions, which never pop in my head, I\'m a bit of a moron probably. Anyhow, I found a bit hard to grasp, took me a while to get the point of some things and probably some things I felt unanswered. But in the end the story had lot going on, lot of confusion, lot of mystery and lot of weird progression and ""truth"". So indeed, a fun trip of brain buggering.✦Art & SoundArt was quite good, but nothing too unique or amazing.As for sound part, cannot remember to be honest. Aside the main ost, cannot remember of any other ost/music in the ""sound"" category.

This was a difficult story to follow, which has influenced my review. That being said, no anime has ever made me want to light my head on fire as much as King of Thorn. By the end I could only laugh because I was so furious. The level of disorganization is absurd, and not in a cool way. King of Thorn is violently and sloppily absurd. Watch something else.At first, I was attracted to the dystopian sci-fi premise: two sisters caught in a deadly pandemic flee the city. One sister opts for cryogenic preservation...backed by a shady govt contractor, leaving the other sister behind. This is where all enjoyment of the movie ceased for me (~20 minutes in).Watching KOT is like strapping your brain to a mechanical bull for two hours. Nothing is explained in order except a movie-long chase scene, which is just a frantic labyrinth of dead ends and dei ex machina.Everything in KOT has the ultimate effect of a mosquito. Untimely, painfully annoying and disposable. The government, scientists, virus, monsters, computers, the castle, the characters… Everything marches to its own drum. It’s impossible to grasp a working relationship between anything at all, so it’s incredibly fragmented. There’s also a fairy tale theme throughout the movie. A fairy tale which, of course, nobody’s heard of. So, don’t be surprised to hear an aimless recitation about witches and spells from time to time. All of this is why I think the manga (hopefully) does this story more justice. It was obviously too complex for production.Characters do nothing but appear spasmodically and say nonsense. They will bring everything to a halt or a painful pivot, then disappear. Seriously, this is the most haphazard anime I’ve ever seen. They have awfully developed personalities, but since they’re always being chased, there’s little time to think about them. Don’t bother listening to what they say, either. Especially anything seeming important; it's a trap.The whole disaster is washed over with schmaltzy concept music, which no sane person would listen to in their free time. It does gets the point across, but not in a charming way.Finally, I give KOT’s animation a 1. All it does is trick people into watching, and it's mediocre.Unless you’ve read the manga, I do not recommend this movie at all.

I'm a fan of the manga. As a fan, I am disappointed with the movie. I enjoyed it, it hit all the major plot points, but it left out a lot and the overall feel and excitement wasn't the same.The movie starts off with a long drawn out sequence of explaining the Medusa Virus and taking the patients to the island. This didn't bother me all that much, as exposition is necessary, but I preferred how it was done it the comics - naturally brought up throughout the...series. It moves into quick, sudden action that pulls you through the few slower, dialogue based scenes.The story - 9Naturally, as a fan of the Manga - I like the story. The anime did leave out a few things, Details on Alice, left out a character, and some minor stuff. The movie hit the most important points which is all I ask for a movie adaption. It's still a shame it couldn't have been a little longer to fill out some of the things it left out though.Art - 3For the most part, the art is just fine. The problem is whenever there is a lot of movement or action - the characters are changed from drawn images to cell-shaded model (Think the graphics to early ps2 games). The movements became a bit off, and some of the switching between styles was weird. I ended up laughing at it a bit - which isn't what you want to do while watching a horror-survival movie.Sound - 7The voice acting of the English dub was good. No performances really stood out. I thought the accents that some people used were a bit awkward at first, but it didn't bother me as the movie sent on.Character - 7I give this a seven because most of the characters miss the development they get in the manga. Due to time constraints, I understand missing out on certain characters. What is most important with the main characters is kept in and done pretty well.Enjoyment - 7I enjoyed it. It wasn't good, but it wasn't anything very special.Overall - 7Overall, it's a good movie and well worth the watch. series.

I ended up laughing at it a bit - which isn't what you want to do while watching a horror-survival movie.Sound - 7The voice acting of the English dub was good. No performances really stood out. I thought the accents that some people used were a bit awkward at first, but it didn't bother me as the movie sent on.Character - 7I give this a seven because most of the characters miss the development they get in the manga. Due to time constraints, I understand missing out on certain characters. What is most important with the main characters is kept in and done pretty well.Enjoyment - 7I enjoyed it.

Key the Metal Idol,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1457/Key_the_Metal_Idol,"[""I first heard of this anime in an old RightStuf catalogue I got in high school. After reading the description, I knew it was a must see.Even though most people would rather see the japanese sub, I highly recommend the english dub. Not only the VAs were decent, but the music has all been remade to english, and is some of the most beautiful music of the mid-late 90s.Storywise, this had a great storyline. You could say this anime has a bit of a Pinocchio complex, as the main character (Key) is trying to become a human. How she does this is to simply make...30,000 friends O.O. How this works out remains a mystery until you get near the end of the series, where all questions will be answered. As Key is faced with obstacles, her human transformation takes place, and truly wows those around her. By the time you get to the end of this anime, you will also fee that you've become one of her friends.The artwork is somewhat outdated, but that's to be expected from an anime made in 1997. However, that's no excuse to toss it aside for it being so old. The character designs of the main cast and the robots raises some nostalgia for the classic Terminator movies. The special effects are truly impressive, worthy of giving this anime an award, if it doesn't already have one. Though there is some nudity, it's not so much to toss this in with ecchi Just enough for you to keep in mind that this is a serious story.Overall, I would have to say this anime is one of my top 5's. After seeing this the first time through, it really brings a tear to your eyes. T_T I highly recommend watching it. 30,000 friends O.O.

You made friends with those you connected with, feuded with those you hated, and largely ignored those that fell by the wayside.  However, there’s an incredibly likely chance you met someone you couldn’t easily categorize...  Someone who challenged your perception of how a fellow classmate should act and interact with the people around them.  Someone like Tokiko Mima, a quiet, strange girl who speaks in a flat, inflectionless voice, carries a broken speech pattern, and seems to have no interest in the world around her.  Now,...being young, you probably haven’t heard of the word Aspergers, so you’re more likely to use words like weird, creepy or gay to categorize kids like this.  Tokiko, or Key for short, has adopted a category of her own:  Robot.  And no, she’s not just saying that to troll you, or to offer up an easy explanation for her own behavior.  Talk to her Grandfather, and he’ll tell you that it’s true...  Or he would, were he still alive.Yes, Tokiko’s guardian has departed this world, and while she’s old enough by Japanese standards to begin living on her own, he’s left her with on final message;  If she goes to Tokyo and makes friends with 30,000 people, she’ll finally be able to become a real human girl.  She catches the next bus out, but it turns out the big city isn’t as friendly as she was expecting it to be.  In fact, the first few people that approach her make it very clear that they’re looking for something a lot more than just friendship.  Luckily, before they can take advantage of her, she’s rescued by an old friend who’d moved away a few years before her, and immediately takes her in.  It’s when they visit Sakura’s part-time job at a video store that Key catches a glimpse of an idol concert, and decides that in order to make 30,000 friends, she has to become a pop idol!  Will her climb to the top see her becoming Japan’s next big national treasure, or will the robot assassins and even more cold-hearted music executives standing in her way prove to be too dangerous of an obstacle for her to overcome?Key the Metal Idol was an OVA series that was released by Studio Pierrot between 1994 and 1996.  There were no deadlines to contend with, and they were able to release the series gradually in single episode VHS chunks, so they were allowed a lot more leniency with their budget than they would have been with a televised anime.  This lack of a financial burden shines through beautifully in what I have to call one of the best looking anime of the mid-nineties.  I admit that the art style and limitation of movements may immediately give away it’s age, but it’s held up surprisingly well over the years, even well into the modern age when a show as attention-demanding as this one would likely have obscure visuals and camera angles compensating for all the dialogue going on.Instead of relying on those kind of cinematography tricks, Key has a much more realistic visual style...  Well, realistic with a few anime tropes thrown in, like big-eyes female characters and the all-important villain with long white hair...  And it goes a long way in making this old-school anime environment look immersive to the viewer.  Stereotypical anime expressions are nowhere to be found, which is something I don’t think I’ve ever said in a review, but it makes even the most useless character look relatable in some way.  The difference in lighting and color between Key’s mountain home and the big city, along with an attention to detail that captures every spot of grime and turning gear, tells you all you need to know about both locations.  Random people in the background don’t always move, but with smart editing, you’ll tend not to notice this enough for it to bother you.The realism also extends to the character designs, as almost everyone in the series has your typical dark Japanese hair, which helps Key to stand out in contrast, being the only character other than a certain white haired Russian to have a lighter, grayer tone of hair than anyone else, and the choice to have it go back to brown every time she’s unable to control her emotions makes it easy for us to distinguish between her robotic and human selves.   The robots roaming the city also look like about what you’d expect them to...  Giant, bulky brutes covered in way too much armor, like the original Ironman suit.  All in all, the decision to make almost everything look and move in realistic ways is in deliberate service to the themes of the story, which deal with certain facets of humanity, but aren’t really apparent until future rewatches.The music is also a clear indicator of the show’s age, as you’d probably expect a show about a girl who may or not be a robot surrounded by beings that are definitely robots to be dominated by EDM or Dubstep in today’s market.  While there are mechanical sounds in a few of the tracks, particularly the first few beats of the opening theme, this soundtrack is pure rock and roll, with a few slower ballads thrown in for good measure.  Being that it’s an anime about musical artists, there are of course a lot of tracks including vocal performances, mostly from voice actor Chiyako Shibahara, who is an insanely good singer, and she takes care of the stark majority of the in-universe songs.  The rest of the tracks are performed by Sario Kijima, including the haunting tunes from the opening and closing videos.Speaking of the themes, the opening is just mesmerizing, and it employs a style where every single dreamlike shot connects in some way to the shot following it.  I know that Railgun and Index also did this at one point (each), but it works so much better here in the way that the constant motion relates to the narrative of the series.  The ending theme may have equally beautiful music to the opening, but since the series was released episode by episode, the ending is presented as more theatrical than what most anime viewers are used to, with a scroll of text on a black background, and a slide show of images eventually appearing on screen underneath them.  There are also a few background tracks that don’t really fit into the rock definition I mentioned earlier, but they’re fairly low-key, and they serve their purposes fine.Before I start talking about the dub, I should probably take some time to acknowledge the thing that most of you will notice right off the bat...  If you’re old enough to have experienced the original Ocean Studios dub of Dragonball Z, you’ll already recognize at least half of this cast.  This Canadian dubbing company doesn’t specialize in anime, rather in western animation, but they do have a few anime to their name, and Key was one of them.  Moving on, if you’re a brony, you’ll probably do a double take when I tell you that the role of Key, the flat-voiced girl who says everything with an artificial-sounding mechanical tint, was played by Nicole Oliver, who played a very small number of anime roles...  the tragic hero Naomi Misora may ring a bell... as well as the duplicitous Princess Celestia, who could be a more different character from Key.  It’s difficult to act when playing such a monotonous character, but Oliver makes up for it by exploding with complexity and emotion every time her human side takes over.In other words, she’s the perfect actor for the role, but her best friend stands in stark contrast to her.  Megan Leitch provides the voice of Sakura, and while she does a decent job about a quarter of the time, she can’t nail down the tone of a scene to save her life.  Her voice roles can be counted on one hand, and thank god, because she replaces all of the warmth and comfort that Miki Nagasawa brought to some scenes with over-the-top melodrama, and when she tries to give the character an attitude, she sounds like a child actor from an old Charlie Brown cartoon.  She does emotional scenes well enough, but she’s still the weak link that the rest of the cast has to compensate for.  Two of their male allies are voiced by the original dub actors of Recoome and BOTH Goku voices, and they do just fine, especially with the obscene amount of dialogue they have to soldier through in the abysmal episode 14.John Novak, Mark Gibbon and David Sobolov haven’t had much credits to their names, but they managed to play exceptionally intimidating villains as the terrifying record executive Ajo and his cold-hearted henchman Sergei.  Brian Drummond, who played the original Vegeta and supplied the world with it’s favorite anime-based meme of all time(“Its over 9000!) plays my favorite character in the series, Hikaru Tsurugi, a talent trainer who’s obsessed with raw genuine emotion and disgusted with the idea of people trying to succeed by showing him what they think he wants to see.  He saw the human side of Key once, and was immediately hooked by how honest and fragile it was, which led to him targeting her as a pupil...  A pupil whom he would stare at for hours on end, cruelly provoking and depriving her in the hope of seeing that face again.  In his first appearances, he comes off as slimy and arrogant, the sort of over-privileged man who’s been spoiled by his own success, but as the methods to his madness are revealed,he goes further and further off the deep end until he finally starts resembling the grinning Death Note Shinigami that would eventually define Drummond’s career.Is there anyone else left who’s worth talking about?  Well, you know, nobody in particular, except for Saffron freaking Henderson.  If you don’t know who that is, she played not only Goku in Dragonball, but Gohan in the follow-up series DBZ, at least in the Ocean dub.  So who does she play in Key?  Some little kid, maybe one of the main characters in a childhood flashback?  Nope.  Not only does she play the idol character Miho that got Key into becoming an idol in the first place, she sings the English version of almost every single song on the soundtrack.  And she sounds phenomenal in them.  With her primary character, she has to play not only the healthy sounding robot version, but the weak, shriveled up slave version that nobody gets to see behind the scenes, and she never stops being convincing through any of it.  While Sakura may be a special exception, I highly recommend this dub.As you may have surmised from my plot summary, this is a series who’s deepest details are shrouded in mystery, and at times, it can be a very confusing tale for first-time viewers.  We’re offered many questions to ponder as Key begins her journey, but thankfully, the first one we’re encouraged to focus on is whether or not she’s actually a robot.  This plot point will eventually fade away as the more serious plot elements start to take form, but as a jumping off point, this one is handled really well.  In addition to the hair colors that I mentioned earlier, the series is very careful with how much evidence it gives us towards one conclusion or the other.  We never see Key eat, and her grandfather makes a point of telling her that he recently made a new body for her...  Which is designed to create a small plothole that’s just hard enough to decipher to make the viewer feel uneasy about what they’re being told.The only definitive detail clue we’re given is that when Key’s hair color changes, she’s somehow able to subconsciously perform supernatural feats, such as levitating people and objects, and making machines go on the fritz.  She’s often shown nude, particularly in the first episode, but these scenes are so clinical and cold that they can hardly be called fan-service at all.  It feels more like seeing C-3PO with his gold plating off than a seventeen year old girl in her birthday suit.  Oh, and before anybody suggests that the animators just don’t know how to create a sexy nude scene, her friend Sakura has a shower scene that exudes sexuality, despite being ten seconds long and fitting into context as a hygienic shower between jobs.And yes, that’s another plot point that makes the possibility of Key being a robot more apparent...  Her best friend is unmistakably human, to the point that I’m pretty sure I’ve known about a dozen people like her, both male and female.  While Key just kinda exists in Sakura’s apartment, taking advantage of the shelter being offered to her, Sakura is off working three different part-time jobs to pay for her rent and food costs.  And they’re not particularly glamorous jobs, either...  Pizza delivery, garbage truck directing, and video store cashier.  Most people in that kind of situation would look for some kind of break, right?  Well, earlier, I mentioned that Sakura saved Key from some shady individuals that were looking to produce the first ever robot-girl porno.  What I didn’t mention is that they made a similar offer to Sakura when they caught up with the two girls later.  Now, Key showed a mild sign of humanity when she realized what they were doing and tried to excuse herself, right before being rescued, but Sakura reacts a little differently.  She identifies them as the sleaze that they are, and refuses to work for them...  Until they bring up the money she’d make.  She doesn’t accept their offer, but she does falter, however briefly, as it would be a break from the daily grind.We all have morals, we all have standards, and we all have certain extents to which our dignity can hold out...  But when we’re treading water, magical solutions can become tempting.  Would Sakura have accepted if her friends hadn’t been there?  I don’t *think* so, but the fact that she’s able to choose her own abilities and work ethic over a magical solution that may end up hurting her in the long run is the exact opposite of Key, who doesn’t believe she has the capacity to make 30,000 friends without the magical solution of becoming an Idol, which in this series turns out to be a way more dangerous pursuit than porn.  This difference between them plays up not only the robotic elements of Key’s personality, but also the ultimate theme of the series...  The dilemma between reality and fantasy.There are two rather popular topics that Key the Metal Idol likes to discuss in relation to this theme...  They’re topics I’ve seen brought up many times before, and they both have a lot of room for different perspectives.  The first one is, obviously, the true life of being an Idol.  This is far more a Japanese subject than it is anywhere else, as Japan’s Idol culture is a monster in it’s own right.  Perfect Blue explored how Idols are subjected to the controls of not only the people managing them, whom they have to do uncomfortable things to please, but by the perceptions of their fanbases, whose acceptance or refusal of the changes they make can have devastating impacts on their careers.  A more recent show called Love Live took a different route, showing how hard and sincerely people have to work to become idols in the first place.The second topic is the relationship between man and machines.  Chobits is perhaps the most noteworthy example, as it explores the hikkikimori’s mind set, with a focus on how a computer may be more equipped to offer a man the perfect, idealized woman than actual women are.  Other titles like the Matrix franchise have explored the idea of creation, and how the machines we birthed could eventually conquer us and take over the world, turning on their creators as man have with God.  There’s also a lot of fiction dealing with artificial intelligence in this way, but shockingly, Key the Metal Idol doesn’t even touch the subject of AI.  Instead, it has more in common with the Fullmetal Alchemist idea that you have to trade life to create life, even if it’s just the illusion of life.Through it’s plot, Key combines these two topics in many intriguing ways, particularly when it comes to Ajo and his business ventures, one of which manages the idol Miho.  Key believes that becoming an idol like Miho will help her transition from robot to person, but what she doesn’t know is that(and this is only a small spoiler) the real Miho is locked away backstage, attached to a headset, controlling a robotic puppet on-stage while she withers away, her life itself unappreciated by those who own her.  What Key expects is the exact opposite of what’s really happening, because becoming an idol in this universe is a process where a human becomes a robot, and not the other way around.  In other words, an object wishes to become a person through means that actually turns people into objects.  Add that to the fact that robots can’t move on their own, and are powered by human life force, and you have the perfect metaphor for human beings trying to create life in their own image, attempting to play God and failing miserably at it.And if you need more proof about the religious angle of this theme, there’s an actual religious cult that plays a major role in the plot, painting Key’s abilities as miracles, and putting every ounce of effort into protecting her from her aspirations to join the world of Idolhood...  Which, if read from the perspective I mentioned earlier, is a pursuit removed from God.  When in the service of this cult, Key’s powers are used with more benevolence than at any other point in the series...  She even brings a sick little boy back from the brink, something she didn’t even try when a far more tragic death occurred right in front of her towards the end of the series.  The significance of religion in this equation is established even more firmly by the fact that robots eventually wipe out this cult, as if to say that man, as God’s creations, have created something that kills God...  An idea further supported by a metric butt-ton of expositive backstory later on.  And thus you have the main driving theme of the series...  The reality of humanity vs. the fantasy of created humans.  Robots that are built to fight wars for us or even just perform for us need to drink our life force to work, just like how idols that are meant to simultaneously uphold our moral ideals as well as our standards for youth and beauty are just being unrealistically objectified.Key the Metal Idol brings us a tightly written narrative, flawlessly weaving different topics into a theme that beats at the very heart of the story, all while inviting us along for a poignant mystery as to how any of these circumstances came about, what it means to the world, and just where it’ll all take our adorkable android heroine.  There would have to be some serious flaws in it’s execution for me to give it anything less than a perfect score...  But alas, that elusive 10/10 will not be reached today.  For you see, even though the animation holds up over twenty years later, and even though the plot is dripping with depth, the mystery still needs to unfold properly...  And it’s with this element that Key fumbles.  See, the final two episodes are each feature-length, at over 90 minutes apiece, and it deeply saddens me to say this, but episode 14 is borderline unwatchable.In order to justify basically everything that had happened thus far in the story, the writers needed to explain to us who Key was, what she was, and how these life force eating robots came to be.  And here’s the beautiful part;  They could have done this by airing a 26 minute flashback episode from Key’s grandfather’s perspective.  Instead, the entire story...  Intricate details, motivations, speculations...  Is fed to us in the form of exposition while Grandpa’s story is shown to us in the background.  It’s bad enough that the majority of it is revealed in conversation between two supporting characters, but the rest of it is coming from some random old dude who telling his tale to literally nobody as he constructs a new robot.  And all the while, the two main characters are huddled in their apartment, hugging each other.  How’s that for female lead characters?  They don’t need to know what’s going on...  They just need to be emotionally supportive while the men-folk work things out for the audience.  The final episode manages to improve immensely from there, including delivering a heartbreaking death scene out of the clumsy, stupid set-up that 14 gave it, but at that point, the damage was already done.Key: The Metal Idol was originally available from Viz Media, but has unfortunately been out of print since 2004.  You can find the three individual DVDs online for a variety of prices, or you can find them with the official series box for anywhere from sixty to 100 dollars.  Copies with the slim-pack CD Soundtrack still inside of them will run you quite a bit more, although I was able to find my copy at FYE for 26 dollars.  It can be viewed legally on Viewster.com, and pretty much nowhere else.  Soundtrack CDs can be found in varying online locations as well.This series came so close to being perfect that it tortures me to see it fall so far short right at the end.  I guess you can blame the sudden lapse in judgement on the huge time lapses between each episode’s release...  There was a seven month gap between episodes 13 and 14, and I while I have no idea what happened in that time, I have to assume that somewhere along the way, Director Hiroaki Sato must have gotten bags of letters from angry fans that he’d made the mistake of treating with respect and intelligence saying that they didn’t understand what was going on, and wanted him to stop playing coy and lay it all out on the table.  I mean, what else could it be?  This series was in production for three years, with fans loyally picking up each volume, even though they were coming out at month-long intervals at best, so that in 1997, after going all winter without a solid release, fans just over-reacted and started demanding closure, even at ass-expensive Japanese VHS/DVD prices.  I can’t entirely forgive it for this blunder,  whatever the reason behind it was, because the unwatchable episode is NOT skippable, but you know what?  I can still whole-heartedly recommend this series, even with that small warning attached to it.  If you’re looking for a mature anime with R-rated content and deep, complex themes to back it up, and you don’t mind getting over one major hurdle at the end, I highly recommend checking this series out.  You’ll feel challenged in a way that’ll have you coming back to it over and over again, just like I did.  I give Key the Metal Idol a 9/10. being young, you probably haven’t heard of the word Aspergers, so you’re more likely to use words like weird, creepy or gay to categorize kids like this.

Brian Drummond, who played the original Vegeta and supplied the world with it’s favorite anime-based meme of all time(“Its over 9000!) plays my favorite character in the series, Hikaru Tsurugi, a talent trainer who’s obsessed with raw genuine emotion and disgusted with the idea of people trying to succeed by showing him what they think he wants to see.  He saw the human side of Key once, and was immediately hooked by how honest and fragile it was, which led to him targeting her as a pupil...  A pupil whom he would stare at for hours on end, cruelly provoking and depriving her in the hope of seeing that face again.  In his first appearances, he comes off as slimy and arrogant, the sort of over-privileged man who’s been spoiled by his own success, but as the methods to his madness are revealed,he goes further and further off the deep end until he finally starts resembling the grinning Death Note Shinigami that would eventually define Drummond’s career.Is there anyone else left who’s worth talking about?  Well, you know, nobody in particular, except for Saffron freaking Henderson.  If you don’t know who that is, she played not only Goku in Dragonball, but Gohan in the follow-up series DBZ, at least in the Ocean dub.  So who does she play in Key?  Some little kid, maybe one of the main characters in a childhood flashback?  Nope.  Not only does she play the idol character Miho that got Key into becoming an idol in the first place, she sings the English version of almost every single song on the soundtrack.  And she sounds phenomenal in them.  With her primary character, she has to play not only the healthy sounding robot version, but the weak, shriveled up slave version that nobody gets to see behind the scenes, and she never stops being convincing through any of it.  While Sakura may be a special exception, I highly recommend this dub.As you may have surmised from my plot summary, this is a series who’s deepest details are shrouded in mystery, and at times, it can be a very confusing tale for first-time viewers.  We’re offered many questions to ponder as Key begins her journey, but thankfully, the first one we’re encouraged to focus on is whether or not she’s actually a robot.  This plot point will eventually fade away as the more serious plot elements start to take form, but as a jumping off point, this one is handled really well.  In addition to the hair colors that I mentioned earlier, the series is very careful with how much evidence it gives us towards one conclusion or the other.  We never see Key eat, and her grandfather makes a point of telling her that he recently made a new body for her...  Which is designed to create a small plothole that’s just hard enough to decipher to make the viewer feel uneasy about what they’re being told.The only definitive detail clue we’re given is that when Key’s hair color changes, she’s somehow able to subconsciously perform supernatural feats, such as levitating people and objects, and making machines go on the fritz.  She’s often shown nude, particularly in the first episode, but these scenes are so clinical and cold that they can hardly be called fan-service at all.  It feels more like seeing C-3PO with his gold plating off than a seventeen year old girl in her birthday suit.  Oh, and before anybody suggests that the animators just don’t know how to create a sexy nude scene, her friend Sakura has a shower scene that exudes sexuality, despite being ten seconds long and fitting into context as a hygienic shower between jobs.And yes, that’s another plot point that makes the possibility of Key being a robot more apparent...  Her best friend is unmistakably human, to the point that I’m pretty sure I’ve known about a dozen people like her, both male and female.  While Key just kinda exists in Sakura’s apartment, taking advantage of the shelter being offered to her, Sakura is off working three different part-time jobs to pay for her rent and food costs.  And they’re not particularly glamorous jobs, either...  Pizza delivery, garbage truck directing, and video store cashier.  Most people in that kind of situation would look for some kind of break, right?  Well, earlier, I mentioned that Sakura saved Key from some shady individuals that were looking to produce the first ever robot-girl porno.  What I didn’t mention is that they made a similar offer to Sakura when they caught up with the two girls later.  Now, Key showed a mild sign of humanity when she realized what they were doing and tried to excuse herself, right before being rescued, but Sakura reacts a little differently.  She identifies them as the sleaze that they are, and refuses to work for them...  Until they bring up the money she’d make.  She doesn’t accept their offer, but she does falter, however briefly, as it would be a break from the daily grind.We all have morals, we all have standards, and we all have certain extents to which our dignity can hold out...  But when we’re treading water, magical solutions can become tempting.  Would Sakura have accepted if her friends hadn’t been there?  I don’t *think* so, but the fact that she’s able to choose her own abilities and work ethic over a magical solution that may end up hurting her in the long run is the exact opposite of Key, who doesn’t believe she has the capacity to make 30,000 friends without the magical solution of becoming an Idol, which in this series turns out to be a way more dangerous pursuit than porn.  This difference between them plays up not only the robotic elements of Key’s personality, but also the ultimate theme of the series...  The dilemma between reality and fantasy.There are two rather popular topics that Key the Metal Idol likes to discuss in relation to this theme...  They’re topics I’ve seen brought up many times before, and they both have a lot of room for different perspectives.  The first one is, obviously, the true life of being an Idol.  This is far more a Japanese subject than it is anywhere else, as Japan’s Idol culture is a monster in it’s own right.  Perfect Blue explored how Idols are subjected to the controls of not only the people managing them, whom they have to do uncomfortable things to please, but by the perceptions of their fanbases, whose acceptance or refusal of the changes they make can have devastating impacts on their careers.  A more recent show called Love Live took a different route, showing how hard and sincerely people have to work to become idols in the first place.The second topic is the relationship between man and machines.  Chobits is perhaps the most noteworthy example, as it explores the hikkikimori’s mind set, with a focus on how a computer may be more equipped to offer a man the perfect, idealized woman than actual women are.  Other titles like the Matrix franchise have explored the idea of creation, and how the machines we birthed could eventually conquer us and take over the world, turning on their creators as man have with God.  There’s also a lot of fiction dealing with artificial intelligence in this way, but shockingly, Key the Metal Idol doesn’t even touch the subject of AI.  Instead, it has more in common with the Fullmetal Alchemist idea that you have to trade life to create life, even if it’s just the illusion of life.Through it’s plot, Key combines these two topics in many intriguing ways, particularly when it comes to Ajo and his business ventures, one of which manages the idol Miho.  Key believes that becoming an idol like Miho will help her transition from robot to person, but what she doesn’t know is that(and this is only a small spoiler) the real Miho is locked away backstage, attached to a headset, controlling a robotic puppet on-stage while she withers away, her life itself unappreciated by those who own her.  What Key expects is the exact opposite of what’s really happening, because becoming an idol in this universe is a process where a human becomes a robot, and not the other way around.  In other words, an object wishes to become a person through means that actually turns people into objects.  Add that to the fact that robots can’t move on their own, and are powered by human life force, and you have the perfect metaphor for human beings trying to create life in their own image, attempting to play God and failing miserably at it.And if you need more proof about the religious angle of this theme, there’s an actual religious cult that plays a major role in the plot, painting Key’s abilities as miracles, and putting every ounce of effort into protecting her from her aspirations to join the world of Idolhood...  Which, if read from the perspective I mentioned earlier, is a pursuit removed from God.  When in the service of this cult, Key’s powers are used with more benevolence than at any other point in the series...  She even brings a sick little boy back from the brink, something she didn’t even try when a far more tragic death occurred right in front of her towards the end of the series.  The significance of religion in this equation is established even more firmly by the fact that robots eventually wipe out this cult, as if to say that man, as God’s creations, have created something that kills God...  An idea further supported by a metric butt-ton of expositive backstory later on.  And thus you have the main driving theme of the series...  The reality of humanity vs. the fantasy of created humans.  Robots that are built to fight wars for us or even just perform for us need to drink our life force to work, just like how idols that are meant to simultaneously uphold our moral ideals as well as our standards for youth and beauty are just being unrealistically objectified.Key the Metal Idol brings us a tightly written narrative, flawlessly weaving different topics into a theme that beats at the very heart of the story, all while inviting us along for a poignant mystery as to how any of these circumstances came about, what it means to the world, and just where it’ll all take our adorkable android heroine.  There would have to be some serious flaws in it’s execution for me to give it anything less than a perfect score...  But alas, that elusive 10/10 will not be reached today.  For you see, even though the animation holds up over twenty years later, and even though the plot is dripping with depth, the mystery still needs to unfold properly...  And it’s with this element that Key fumbles.  See, the final two episodes are each feature-length, at over 90 minutes apiece, and it deeply saddens me to say this, but episode 14 is borderline unwatchable.In order to justify basically everything that had happened thus far in the story, the writers needed to explain to us who Key was, what she was, and how these life force eating robots came to be.  And here’s the beautiful part;  They could have done this by airing a 26 minute flashback episode from Key’s grandfather’s perspective.  Instead, the entire story...  Intricate details, motivations, speculations...  Is fed to us in the form of exposition while Grandpa’s story is shown to us in the background.  It’s bad enough that the majority of it is revealed in conversation between two supporting characters, but the rest of it is coming from some random old dude who telling his tale to literally nobody as he constructs a new robot.  And all the while, the two main characters are huddled in their apartment, hugging each other.  How’s that for female lead characters?  They don’t need to know what’s going on...  They just need to be emotionally supportive while the men-folk work things out for the audience.  The final episode manages to improve immensely from there, including delivering a heartbreaking death scene out of the clumsy, stupid set-up that 14 gave it, but at that point, the damage was already done.Key: The Metal Idol was originally available from Viz Media, but has unfortunately been out of print since 2004.  You can find the three individual DVDs online for a variety of prices, or you can find them with the official series box for anywhere from sixty to 100 dollars.  Copies with the slim-pack CD Soundtrack still inside of them will run you quite a bit more, although I was able to find my copy at FYE for 26 dollars.  It can be viewed legally on Viewster.com, and pretty much nowhere else.  Soundtrack CDs can be found in varying online locations as well.This series came so close to being perfect that it tortures me to see it fall so far short right at the end.  I guess you can blame the sudden lapse in judgement on the huge time lapses between each episode’s release...  There was a seven month gap between episodes 13 and 14, and I while I have no idea what happened in that time, I have to assume that somewhere along the way, Director Hiroaki Sato must have gotten bags of letters from angry fans that he’d made the mistake of treating with respect and intelligence saying that they didn’t understand what was going on, and wanted him to stop playing coy and lay it all out on the table.  I mean, what else could it be?  This series was in production for three years, with fans loyally picking up each volume, even though they were coming out at month-long intervals at best, so that in 1997, after going all winter without a solid release, fans just over-reacted and started demanding closure, even at ass-expensive Japanese VHS/DVD prices.  I can’t entirely forgive it for this blunder,  whatever the reason behind it was, because the unwatchable episode is NOT skippable, but you know what?  I can still whole-heartedly recommend this series, even with that small warning attached to it.  If you’re looking for a mature anime with R-rated content and deep, complex themes to back it up, and you don’t mind getting over one major hurdle at the end, I highly recommend checking this series out.  You’ll feel challenged in a way that’ll have you coming back to it over and over again, just like I did.  I give Key the Metal Idol a 9/10.', ""Story: The story for Key the Metal Idol is relatively simple at first.  It's the generic 'go on a quest' type.  For Key she has to get all these fans so she can change from a robot into a human, relatively blah right?  Yeah, it kind of is.The story does get really good at the end but getting there takes forever and the pacing of the series isn't good.  It's relatively boring for about three or four episodes and then BAM! something just exciting enough happens so you keep watching the series a little longer to see how it...ends.Up until the end practically nothing really makes any sense at all.  However, the ending is quite good and it wraps up the series nicely and with no loose ends.  And the story, once it gets going, is rather original and ... strange.Art:  About the art there's not much to be said.  It was released mid-90s so it has the generic art type from that time.  Nothing really spectacular about it, it's above average, little else.  There is one saving grace about the art though: the robot designs.  They are excellent, the problem is you don't get to see them too much.Sound:  Here comes the one thing that really hurts this series.  The sound isn't very good at all.  The voices are altogether cheesy and halting, espicially Key's.  By the end of the series you just want Key to shut up because her voice is so annoying.  It's the generic robot voice that you can listen to on your computer.  They didn't even need a voice actor for her part.Also, there is a lot of singing but only one song is really any good in my opinion and that's the lullabye.  (Can't really describe it without spoiling the series.)  Besides that the songs just aren't vrey good, espiecially the opening theme which nearly turned me off before I even got two minutes in.Character:  At first all the characters seem rather generic and boring but they start to get better around the halfway point of the series.  This goes espiecially for Key as you can probably guess why.Also, the pasts of the power players in it are really good since the series pretty much remade the history of the world of robotics from the forties on.  (It's fun to watch, espiecially if you are into robotics.)Enjoyment:  The series will make you happy ... if you can stick with it.  I had to watch about four episodes at a time and then take a few hours break before returning to it.  If you do it this way, you won't fall asleep ... most likely, and you'll get the most out of it.  The ending really makes it worth struggling through the first thirteen episodes.Overall:  This series is a good series, if you can make it through.  It isn't very action oriented but the conversations are pretty deep and the plot twists are excellent ... though some of them are a little obvious.  Everything does come together at the end and it's an excellent ending.Although this isn't the greatest show ever released, it's worth a look espiecially if you like strange anime or if you like your sci-fi with a little twist.  It may not be your favorite series ever, but you won't be disappointed. ends.Up until the end practically nothing really makes any sense at all.

Conceptually speaking, it definitely had potential, but this would go largely unrealised. Given the fact that Key's final two episodes are each an hour and a half long, it's possible that scheduling and/or finances are the reason/s for this squandered potential.Key's story is a fairly obvious criticism of the idol industry in Japan. As a Western viewer, it's hard to deconstruct this aspect of the story in any meaningful way since idols (in this context) are a cultural phenomenon exclusive to Japan. That being said, it is interesting...in the way it depicts idols as robots/puppets, and how a human's life force is drained controlling these idols. Having the titular protagonist Key struggle with the ambiguity of her being either a human or a robot also gives at least some reason to watch through to the end. Her naïvety also leads her into some...interesting situations, to say the least. The tense moments towards the end, as well as the painfully long build-up, make the ending satisfying enough in the moment, but certainly not worth the slog that precedes it - especially episode 14, which just dumps a bunch of information on the viewer.The characters are bland. They mainly act as a medium for the story - each serves their purpose, but you probably won't end up caring for any of them, even if the Japanese voice acting is decent. I doubt many people would get excited seeing any of these characters in another story, or as merchandise.Whilst the art is OK, the animation is terrible. In almost every situation the bare minimum is done to make it watchable. At one point, they don't even bother to properly animate a group of people sitting down, they sort of just awkwardly fade downwards. A lot of people put this down to its age, but there were plenty of anime at the time that looked leagues better. Key is far below average. As expected, the exception to this is the opening, which looks cool, if a bit awkward at times. The ED is just credits on a black background. Unfortunately, these issues with the visuals are compounded by the poor DVD quality of the anime. Anime DVDs looked bad in the 90s. This isn't a problem for the more popular ones (see: Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop), since they got Blu-Ray releases. It's definitely a problem for Key, which didn't receive nearly enough attention to warrant a Blu-Ray version. The footage is jittery, a bit unclear, and the subtitles are a bright yellow, which would have helped legibility when watched on the CRT TVs it was designed for, but is a complete eyesore nowadays. (Oh, and I counted 11 typos/mistakes in the subs- but I'd be interested to see if anyone could find more.) Come to think of it, it's probably not a good sign when the part of an anime you feel the most strongly about is the visuals.Sound-wise, it isn't anything to write home about. The opening song is good, but nothing else - not sound effect nor song - sticks out as good. Or bad, for that matter, so it at least doesn't actively harm the experience. That being said, I like how they used the full version of the opening song to start the final episode off, combined with footage from previous episodes - an early AMV of sorts.Overall, Key the Metal Idol aimed fairly high, but ended up an unimpressive bore - one fated for obscurity. in the way it depicts idols as robots/puppets, and how a human's life force is drained controlling these idols.

Tokiko Mima, nicknamed Key, is a robot girl who lives in the Japanese countryside. When Key’s grandfather, Dr. Mima passes away unexpectedly, he leaves her a dying message about how she can become human by making herself 30,000 friends. In order to fulfill this goal, Key heads to the busy streets of Tokyo where she quickly encounters her best friend, Sakura Kuriyagawa who had moved away years before. Thus, the two begin a quest to help Key become human, believing the best way to do so is to make Key an idol singer, like...the well-known Miho Utsuse.Don’t let the premise fool you, this is both a dark show as well as a very intellectually fulfilling one. The similarities to Pinocchio are there with Key’s main goal to become human, but this is not a story for children. This become apparent from the very first episode where the naïve Key gets tricked into being recruited for pornography and is only saved by the coincidental appearance of her friend Sakura. The show has a considerable amount of violence and nudity, and contains several scenes focusing on the almost sexual fetish that the main villain, Jinsaku Ajo, has for the robot soldiers he creates. The show also does a very effective job at showing that the life of an idol singer is not as glamorous as it appears to be. Key idolizes the singer Miho, but we get a lot of background on the life Miho truly lives and it’s not pretty.Also interesting is the mystery surrounding the titular character. A big mystery delved into by the show is whether Key really is a robot, or if she simply thinks she is one. While Key has no doubt that she is a robot, the fact is that there is no evidence that she really is one. She is completely human in appearance, displaying no robotic parts, and while she has a tendency to mysteriously pass out at times, this is very possibly just her suffering from anemia. Key certainly has a robotic personality; the character is very similar to Rei Ayanami from Evangelion (and she may have been an inspiration for said character). But that doesn’t mean she’s a robot, it could be she suffered some traumatic event as a child that caused her to think that way. Even Key’s best friend Sakura simply thinks Key is living under some kind of delusion. But then if she human, what will happen if she makes 30,000 friends?The show has a very interesting interplay among its main storylines; Key’s quest to become human, the life of Miho the idol singer and the mysterious company behind her led by Ajo. All of the storylines are intrinsically linked with one another and scenes in one storyline often can have big impact on other ones.Technically, the show is fairly up there for its time. Being an OVA, the animation is typically of good quality throughout the show and the character design is strong. Given that idol singers is a big part of the plot, having a strong musical score is critical, and the show really delivers there, both with the instrumentals and the lyrical songs. The English dub is also quite strong, arguably as good as the Japanese one is. Megan Leitch as Sakura and John Novak in particular as Ajo put in great performances, but there isn’t really any performance here that I would say is below average. The songs are all dubbed in English as well and don’t really lose anything being in English. One flaw with the dub is that 2 of the major characters get recast halfway through the show.Unfortunately the show does have its flaw, and that resides with the final 2 episodes. Much like with famous TV shows like The X-Files or Lost, when you build up such mystery throughout the show, when it is time to provide the answers you can risk not pulling it off right and alienating your audience. I think this show really does that towards the end. The second to last episode, which is 90 minutes in length (as is the finale) is composed primarily of us being narrated all of the background information of the show. While we do get certain flashbacks of this, a large portion of this is either told via a couple of characters sitting on a bench, one giving all this info to another, or an old man working by himself, recollecting the past. Being able to show, not tell is a critical thing a director needs to be able to do in the visual medium, and that simply isn’t the case here. Even if the answers themselves are for the most part interesting and fulfilling, the manner in which they are told is a massive failure. The director should have figured out a way to better disperse these answers throughout the storyline rather than presenting it to us in this manner.The final episode is a considerable improvement, doing away with this style as we work our way towards the conclusion. In particular it is very emotionally powerful. One of the show’s significant characters dies; I won’t say who but can say that said character’s passing was and remains one of the more emotionally powerful ones to me in anime. Not because of the manner of said character’s death, but the way the character’s life ended up and the effect their death had on another character did a very good job at eliciting an emotional reaction out of me. Unfortunately the show starts to hit some pacing problems as it hits its conclusion; the writers and director knew where they wanted to get us, but the way they got us there was not as believable as it could have been given how quickly it took place.Anyway, this is a very highly recommended show. It’s unfortunate that the show has some problems near the end which means it isn’t as great as it could have been, but that aside, this show was a very entertaining viewing experience and something that many anime fans should enjoy. the well-known Miho Utsuse.Don’t let the premise fool you, this is both a dark show as well as a very intellectually fulfilling one.

The second to last episode, which is 90 minutes in length (as is the finale) is composed primarily of us being narrated all of the background information of the show. While we do get certain flashbacks of this, a large portion of this is either told via a couple of characters sitting on a bench, one giving all this info to another, or an old man working by himself, recollecting the past. Being able to show, not tell is a critical thing a director needs to be able to do in the visual medium, and that simply isn’t the case here. Even if the answers themselves are for the most part interesting and fulfilling, the manner in which they are told is a massive failure. The director should have figured out a way to better disperse these answers throughout the storyline rather than presenting it to us in this manner.The final episode is a considerable improvement, doing away with this style as we work our way towards the conclusion. In particular it is very emotionally powerful. One of the show’s significant characters dies; I won’t say who but can say that said character’s passing was and remains one of the more emotionally powerful ones to me in anime. Not because of the manner of said character’s death, but the way the character’s life ended up and the effect their death had on another character did a very good job at eliciting an emotional reaction out of me. Unfortunately the show starts to hit some pacing problems as it hits its conclusion; the writers and director knew where they wanted to get us, but the way they got us there was not as believable as it could have been given how quickly it took place.Anyway, this is a very highly recommended show. It’s unfortunate that the show has some problems near the end which means it isn’t as great as it could have been, but that aside, this show was a very entertaining viewing experience and something that many anime fans should enjoy.', 'I\'m not really an avid anime watcher, as if you leave out pokemon, yugioh and sailor moon I\'ve only watched maybe 3 other full animes, but this one drew me in just by the title.The title which I think could be understood as idol in all definitions.  The more I watched the more confused I got but as it was drawing to a close everything I was confused about got answered.I had a great time watching this anime and would recommend it to anyone. It is quite dated, as my boyfriend loved to point out. He\'d say things like ""Whoah, that is so...late 80\'s early 90\'s"" and ""Wow, that animation looks old"". Nonetheless,  it is a great watch.So take it from someone who doesn\'t really watch animes XD This is a great anime! late 80\'s early 90\'s"" and ""Wow, that animation looks old"". Nonetheless,  it is a great watch.So take it from someone who doesn\'t really watch animes XD This is a great anime!', ""This is a 17 yo classic, while both animation character design and music show their age, they are still impeccable and very good if you look at it from a classics's perspective...The best about The Metal Idol, is the Intricate story that develops really slowly but very deeply and very detailed, episode 14 at 97m was almost mind washing, almost everything is explained, all the secrets and mysteries built and there is a lot of character development, this all continues in the last episode where they continue to build up and prepare for the last assault, there are many sacrifices in the path for Key...to become Human once again but in the end everyone is saved with her Lulaby...The cast for this anime considering its age its very well composed, specially the male V.A. i could reckon them all in recent anime with a single exception of one actor that isnt very well known...This is a great classic, maybe a little sad but a very mature look and story... to become Human once again but in the end everyone is saved with her Lulaby...The cast for this anime considering its age its very well composed, specially the male V.A. i could reckon them all in recent anime with a single exception of one actor that isnt very well known...This is a great classic, maybe a little sad but a very mature look and story..."", 'Is she, or isn\'t she?Key: the Metal Idol is the story of a young girl, or more accurately a robot, named Mima Tokiko, or as most people refer to her, Key, in her quest to become ""human"". This mission is given to her by her Grandfather Doctor Mima on his deathbed, recorded on a tape as his last will with the simple instructions to ""make 30,000 friends"" and humanity will be hers. With such a vague explanation and so little restrictions given, how would you go about fulfilling this request? Attempt to make 30,000 individual friends? Maybe start a cult and gather 30,000...followers? Or would you possibly become an idol and gain 30,000 fans? It\'s with these dying words that Key is spurned on to move from her home in the quiet rural village of Mamio Valley to the city of Tokyo, searching for her humanity and unaware of the numerous trials awaiting her, as while she makes her way toward the city, a rival from her Grandfather\'s past who\'s enamored with the warfare potential of robotics, Ajo Jinsaku, sets a deadly plan in motion.To quote one of the best scenes from the series itself, ""It\'s still too early for spoilers"", so I\'m going to try avoid giving too many specific details on the plot, as I found that one line to encapsulate the series as a whole perfectly. The premise sounds unique yet simple, and I certainly haven\'t done it justice with my short description, but it\'s the type of anime that\'s best appreciated going in with a blank slate, and the increasingly cryptic story takes almost the full run of 15 episodes for all the mysteries to unravel and secrets to come to light. Huge comparisons can be drawn to well known and beloved series like Serial Experiments Lain and Boogiepop Phantom in terms of story-telling and cinematography, with Watanabe Takashi having worked on both the latter and this series, and while some people may find it a little ways off measuring up to either of those series, I believe it still manages to hold its own and cement itself as an original story with something to tell. Its the type of series where the more I thought about it after finishing it, the more I was recognizing recurring themes and ideas that were prevalent from start to finish, with more minor focus on some ideas such as the iron mask almost of all of us live behind, showing our best face to the world, while concealing our true one, and also the more majorly explored ideas such as man creating machine in his image as God created man, and the potential consequences, not to mention how great a cost that may come at, or the pursuit, and eventually obsession, with perfection and likewise what would be required of you and to what fate would you eventually be resigned. Arguably though, I would say the most obvious overarching theme is the commentary of Japan\'s idol culture as a whole, and the depiction of the idols as nothing more than puppets on strings that could be cut at any given time if they don\'t dance to their owner\'s tune is all over this series.To comment on the animation, the series was released through the mid 90\'s, so a portion of the animation looks a little dated now and some character designs can be a tad bland, but there are several noticeably higher quality scenes, particularly the fight scenes, which are few and far between but when they appear, the word graphic isn\'t exactly apt, the violence is more-so simply brutal. Crowds always look detailed, costume design was good particularly for the idols and Sakura, and the majority of environments and backgrounds still have a touch of quality and are highly varied, but where it truly excels is in it\'s robots. Not only is each robot as a whole superbly designed, from the Terminator style mechs of Ajo Heavy Industries to the collection of oddities and prototypes designed by Doctor Mima, the close up shots and the deep delves into the inner-workings of these machines themselves, showing their ticking gears, firing pistons and swirling liquids are always mesmerizing when they burst onto the screen. Speaking of mesmerizing, the intro sequence; a perfectly ominous string of shots, alluding to events to come, and events long passed too. Key\'s gentle prancing down an endless checkered corridor, her exiting through a pool of liquid as her human exterior is washed away to reveal her cold, steel interior, and the night-time city depicted as massive, churning cogs, as it\'s shadow is cast down on a lonesome Key and she steps between each of the cogs spokes, very reminiscent of Steins;Gate\'s OP, are all so simple yet so eye-catching to see at the beginning of each episode, accompanied by a haunting and melancholic song of loneliness and wishing to be found, to connect. This show is chock full of simple to interpretive imagery right up to it\'s final moments, but even without trying to discern the messages within, you can easily appreciate how pretty the image is in itself regardless.I did say that the show was lacking a little in character design, but the one stand out by far in terms of design is key herself, which is a bit of a double-edged sword. She\'s as robotic as they come, with the most deadpan expression and monotone voice you could imagine. Her hair is frizzy and bordering on grey, her skin is near-translucent and frame is excruciatingly thin, and her eyes are glassy and unwavering. She truly stands out as memorable visually, but like I said, it\'s a double-edged sword. She\'s so deadpan and robotic in every single scene that she ends up overshadowed by the majority of the other cast in terms of likability, but even when it comes to screen time, most of the other characters are put in the limelight far more often than Key to push the story forward. What does keep you interested in her as a character and her journey though, and the reason I put that question at the very top, is that you find out pretty early on... that nobody believes Key is a robot at all. Even though she\'s the very definition of a robot and introduces herself as a robot to anybody and everybody, even her best friend Sakura thinks she\'s just delusional. Everyone else would be forgiven for not believing her, since the general population believes robots to be no more than a concept in their world, and nobody is aware of who Key\'s Grandfather is either, except Sakura knows full well who he is, since she also grew up in Mamio Valley. The evidence for vastly outweighs the evidence against, yet Key is treated as a child with some form of trauma or potentially autism, despite clearly being more than a regular teenage girl. This is just one of the mysteries that keeps you embroiled in her character and the story as a whole, as you even start to doubt yourself as to whether or not the robot is a robot, or just a confused little girl.When I saw this series was titled ""the Metal Idol"" and had the music tag, I was expecting a lot more songs than there actually was, but thankfully it turned out not to be such a bad thing, as the songs that were included were of exceptional quality. There was plenty of pretty good background music in each episode, but as for the main songs the highlights by far were Key\'s ""Lullaby"" by Shibahara Chiyako, Miho\'s ""Memories of Sand"", also by Shibara Chiyako, and my personal favourite, the OP mentioned above, ""In The Night"" by Kijima Sario. None of these three songs are at all what at least I would expect when I hear the term ""idol music"". They\'re tragic, heartfelt and beautifully sung, and to be honest I\'ve had them playing on repeat constantly, even while writing this review, and I can still vividly recall each piece of the series they\'re attached to as they\'re playing. The sound design was pretty good over the course of the series in other aspects too, particularly again when it comes to the robotic aspect. Hearing the sound fade out as the gears crunching in Key\'s head get louder and louder, before they\'re abruptly cut off by a static crackle or a blast of steam being exerted always sounds so satisfying, and as each episode ends we\'re inevitably given another close up of Key\'s iron mask accompanied by the swelling, foreboding tones of the series ED, ""I\'m Standing By You"" by Kijima Sario.The only true issue I think I had with this series was the pacing. While I was thoroughly engaged in the story and everything it was bringing to the table, some episodes really did crawl by at a snails pace, with scene after scene of dialogue and very little of it being of real substance besides maybe adding more mystique, and the biggest criminal for this was episode 14. I\'d have finished this series about three days ago and typed up my review, but for better and for worse, when I sat down to watch the final two episodes, I realised they\'re both an hour and 40 minutes long, each. While every other episode is the average 24~ minutes, the final two are about the length of a regular film. At first I was delighted to have so much extra content, but episode 14, to put it bluntly, is 100 minutes of exposition. No exaggeration, almost the entirety of it is split between two scenes, going back and forth, of characters laying out the entirety of the history, background, and the answers to near enough to every riddle laid out during the previous 13 episodes, and while it was incredibly informative and cohesive, it honestly came across as lazy to reveal so much in a gigantic info dump in the penultimate episode. The cohesion and how well every single dot was connected were what kept me sitting there for the entire duration, albeit a little annoyed, but the saving grace, when we\'ve finally reached the climax of the series, is the explosive final moments of this second-to-last episode, leading into the finale. While I was more than a little wary going into the last episode, I enjoyed it to the point that I actually watched it twice, with a grand ending more fitting than I could have hoped for. Episodes 14 and 15 are like night and day, and while I understand the necessity for 14 to be dialogue heavy if they want to tie-up the copious amounts of plot-lines and give 15 the true ending it deserves, I can\'t forgive it for how much it dragged on, no matter how good the pay off.I really didn\'t think my review would go on so long, but there was so much I wanted to talk about, and so much I loved, that even while trying not to go into plot developments I just kept typing and typing. I had initially even planned to give it a 7 upon first typing this up, but decided I\'d re-watch the finale, rewrite this a tad and bump up the score to a well deserved 8. It can be slow and a little dated, but it\'s a series that has something to say, with solid art, and enough lurking in the shadows to keep you coming back for more each time. Severely underrated and not even 4,500 people have it completed.It has to be at least 30,000. followers? Or would you possibly become an idol and gain 30,000 fans? It\'s with these dying words that Key is spurned on to move from her home in the quiet rural village of Mamio Valley to the city of Tokyo, searching for her humanity and unaware of the numerous trials awaiting her, as while she makes her way toward the city, a rival from her Grandfather\'s past who\'s enamored with the warfare potential of robotics, Ajo Jinsaku, sets a deadly plan in motion.To quote one of the best scenes from the series itself, ""It\'s still too early for spoilers"", so I\'m going to try avoid giving too many specific details on the plot, as I found that one line to encapsulate the series as a whole perfectly.

A pulpy dive into the spiritual psyche underneath the superfluous mask of artificial intelligence―as well as corruption and abuse in the corporate world and idol industry, and much more than that! This series is drunk on color, a prophetic odyssey that is oozing with uncomfortably numb gore and nudity. Something that distinguishes itself on the basis of its peculiarity alone.•\tThe visual direction is striking. Hiraoki Sato’s directorial sense in this series is something that surpasses the work of Satoshi...Kon. While I do think that the directing is too out-there, as well as more stagnate than any anime should be at its climax, during episodes 12-13; the rest of the series made me feel like I was a child picking out their first anime DVD from a video rental store.

The imminently argot-filled dialogue throughout this series can be hard to follow; the word “geist” that gets slung around, similar to Gundam’s infamous use of “Minovsky particles,” is something that’s practically left up to interpretation.•\tThis series is not something to watch if you’re looking for an anime with likable characters. Like many other OVAs in the 90’s, the focal point of this series is the story. The characters are more like visually-memorable tropes, rather than characters that you’ll actually grow to care about.

I think there is a genuinely good anime here but its hidden under some really odd pacing issues and inconsistent art.For episodes 1-13 you are only getting scant clues as to whats going with the plot details, but its a good level of mystery. I felt I was pulled through those episodes while maintaining interest , but once you get to the last 2 episodes which are full feature length and act as massive exposition dumps which can be hard to sit through.Some details of the story I'm still a little confused about and I'm...still deciding if the ending was satisfying or not, it did have some cool visuals at the end though.The 2 main girls undergo some good development as their relationship gets a little rocky at times but gets patched up by the end. Part of this was a sub plot about the very relatable struggle of living in the city and being short on money and having to put personal dreams on the backburner while working to pay the bills.I watched the dub which was fine for me, Key was appropriately robotic sounding which wasnt necessarily nice to listen to at times but it made sense. Some of the supporting characters voicework was a little camp, which fit the character designs for them being a little dated and camp as well.The english songs were great though and the OP is probably in my top 10 favs now its super stylish. The ED is nice too and I like how the episode fades into the ED which is just a small personal preference. I think Black Lagoon did similar and I liked it there too.So all in all its worth experiencing it, its an odd show with an odd pace but I cant deny I was drawn into it. still deciding if the ending was satisfying or not, it did have some cool visuals at the end though.The 2 main girls undergo some good development as their relationship gets a little rocky at times but gets patched up by the end.

Some parts are jerky while some parts were well connected. Other than that, I will lie to say that I didn't thoroughly enjoy this anime.The story: As seen in the description of the anime, it may seem like this is a generic anime about a robot girl just trying to be human again. However, this anime is more than that. What we see in the story is the main character, Key, is going through obstacles that test her emotions and mind of the state. This is also seen in the people around...her. Like finding 30,000 friends is insane to make a show about, but that what makes this anime enjoyable. There were so many mysteries unraveling for her to find 30,000 friends to become human again. Though the pacing of the story starts off slow in the first few episodes it didn't stop the story from going downhill later in the series.Artwork: Since the anime was made in 1994 from 1997, I do expect the artwork to be outdated. However, the year shouldn't stop others from judging the character design. I'll say the artistic approach of making the robots gives out the nostalgia of robotic designs in sci-fi movies such as Akira. The robot's design was just spectacular in this anime, though there weren't many seen in the anime. I also have to say that this show has some nudity but not for fanservice, which made nudity fit perfectly in this show.Sound: All I have to say is that the soundtrack in this anime is amazing, and love the placement it filled in parts of the episodes.Character: The strongest parts in the anime in my opinion are Key and her best friend. We get to see a sign of Key development when has an encounter with her friend. At first, their relationship started to get a bit shaky, but as the episodes went on, it seems both of them understood their circumstances. Other than that, I enjoyed Key as the main character a lot.I enjoyed this anime, but again my problem would be the pacing of the show. I also have a problem with details in the story being a bit jerky for me. I'm not sure if I am satisfied with the ending because it seems like some gaps should've at least be open. Overall the is a good anime. I'll give it a 7/10. her. Like finding 30,000 friends is insane to make a show about, but that what makes this anime enjoyable.

The robot's design was just spectacular in this anime, though there weren't many seen in the anime. I also have to say that this show has some nudity but not for fanservice, which made nudity fit perfectly in this show.Sound: All I have to say is that the soundtrack in this anime is amazing, and love the placement it filled in parts of the episodes.Character: The strongest parts in the anime in my opinion are Key and her best friend. We get to see a sign of Key development when has an encounter with her friend. At first, their relationship started to get a bit shaky, but as the episodes went on, it seems both of them understood their circumstances. Other than that, I enjoyed Key as the main character a lot.I enjoyed this anime, but again my problem would be the pacing of the show. I also have a problem with details in the story being a bit jerky for me. I'm not sure if I am satisfied with the ending because it seems like some gaps should've at least be open. Overall the is a good anime. I'll give it a 7/10."", ""I am making no exaggeration when I say that the best part of this anime is the intro. Absolutely beautiful singing, and the singer even has two versions, an English and Japanese one, if I'm not mistaken. The story starts off somewhat interesting and proceeds to fall off as it goes on. The art is good for when it was made, but no big deal now. Same with sound design. Most of the characters are one-note. If you really MUST watch this show, either stop after the 13th episode to maintain the mystery (if that's your thing) or only watch the intros. Better yet, just...look it up on YouTube: In The Night Key by Kijima Sario. look it up on YouTube: In The Night Key by Kijima Sario.""]"

I expected a criminal drama, where our mc tries his best to find out the truth while being caught between two fighting gangs. What I did not expect was to see a bunch of boy scouts instead of a gang who do such horrible gang crimes as dance performing, helping single mothers and immigrants and guarding peace in the neighborhood. If it does not sound even remotely close to crime drama - you are not the only one confused. 10 episodes out of 12 are wasted on showing how mc is a good ""fixer"" guy. I...may be wrong, but that kind of introduction should only take an episode or two at best, not most of the season. I could get it if those stories were linked in any way to the actual drama, that is shown in the last two episodes - it would be some insanely long build up, but if executed correctly it would justify all those unlinked meaningless stories. But you see, when you put a bunch of those stories and forget to give them any link to or place in the main plot line - what is even a point of having them? It felt like the first 10 episodes were a giant filler, and they are here just to waste viewers time instead of showing them the show they came for. As for me, cause of this mess I arrived at ep11 already bored and there was not a single chance that anything would redeem this huge waste of time. I doubt I have ever seen such big problems with pacing before.If we move from discussing the plot - things are still pretty bad. Characters for example - there are lots of them. But only a few have a constant place in this show, and even those few are pretty undeveloped and feel more like the tools that mc uses to solve problems in the neighbourhood. Like what do we know about the King, who is literally the most influential character around and a great pal of our MC? Well, he is cool and respected, basically it. The rest of the cast either gets that kind of treatment or even worse.Visuals? They are fine, being a real world it is not really hard thing to draw adequate, but nothing more is done to make the visuals stand out and be something above mediocre.Sound? Well, the choice of tracks fits the theme, but it is not my type of music so I can\'t call opening and ending good. For bgm in episodes themselves - I can\'t even recall if there was a bgm to be honest.Enjoyment? Story and paicing ruined any enjoyment for me.Conclusion: a huge unfun waste of time. You may like it if you like unconnected shallow stories, but for most people I would advice skipping this anime entirely. may be wrong, but that kind of introduction should only take an episode or two at best, not most of the season.

You may like it if you like unconnected shallow stories, but for most people I would advice skipping this anime entirely.', 'The anime that is in every sense of the word, akin to Durarara!!, yet the majority of the people make the assumption/mistake that this series was a rip-off of the former. In actual fact, this show came FIRST (debuted in 2001), and the former (debuted in 2004) was merely inspired from it (that was leaps better in every way). If you\'re watching this show, please take note of this pointer.I do have a legitimate worry for people and studios trying to capitalize on decades-old source materials that were lost in time. If you remember the 2 shows that aired in Spring 2020: Yesterday wo Utatte...(produced by Doga Kobo, based on a manga) and Kitsutsuki Tanteidokoro (produced by Liden Films, based on a novel), both were late-90s source materials that if were adapted right and close to their original magic, could usher in the new revival of old-school adaptations. Sadly this wasn\'t the case, with the former getting a rushed adaptation (for the 2nd half) and the latter being better in its original material (because it\'s so boring to watch). Fast forward to Fall 2020, and Doga Kobo is back with adapting another early 2000s classic: Ikebukuro West Gate Park (or IWGP for short), written by Ira Ishida and based off a novel, a live-action TV series and a manga (that was a loose adaptation of the live-action TV version).But what is this show about, you ask? In a nutshell, as mentioned in the beginning, think of it like Durarara!!: the crime-ridden city of Ikebukuro, where majority of the city is ruled by violent gangs and frequent clashes of turfs for the taking, only less refined. The MC is the city\'s gang mediator-cum-troubleshooter, Makoto Majima (who\'s living together with his single-family mother). A 20-year-old guy who often sees himself getting caught in frivolous acts of crime from seemingly both related and unrelated cases, and has ties with the gang that has a majority stake of Ikebukuro: the G-Boys, lead by his old schoolmate, the goofy and serious two-faced Andou ""King"" Takashi. In this aggravating city where crime does not pay, the single-family supporting son must tread through the vast wilderness of violent outbreaks that range from rival factions to sporadic situations, and even requests from strangers and close friends requiring protection to loved ones being victimized for revenge in the process, solving these various cases and resolving them faster than the local police could, before more lives are lost.Now here my problem with this adaptation: Ira Ishida\'s material undoubtedly gives off the old-school vibe, but to adapt the 4 volume manga seems like a waste in comparison (as akin to just watching the 2000 TV version instead, albeit with a few differences). So, I\'d presume that the scriptwriters made up their own version of IWGP by composing entirely new story scripts to reflect the modern-day standards of Japan in the classic episodic story format, and truth be told, the execution is both hit-and-miss. There are some instances where the episodes are really good (I love that one story where they focused on Japan\'s treatment of foreigners), but the rest were just the same-old cardboard cut-outs of unlinked, repetitious self-contained stories with mindless rival gang fighting over turfs that maintain the power balance of the gang environments (if you don\'t count the episodes featuring another formidable gang: the Red Angels). If you\'re looking for a story to be worth investing your time into, this show will most likely turn you off from its episodic format as there are little overarching plots (that span 2-part episodes at max).Unfortunately, there is little to highlight about character development, as most of them tend to be 2-faced: neutral, or (un)necessarily triggered. For the few (like Makoto\'s mother), they do have personality and past histories to back their hard-lived environments and growing-up circumstances that shape their ""organizational behaviours"" to both friends and strangers through kinship, but sadly those are far and few in-between for a setting like this (that I\'d really like to see more of). Most of the gang members (between both G-Boys and Red Angels, save for the respecting leading duo of King and Kyouichi, along with troubleshooter Makoto) are one-note, and is about what I\'d expect of the typical one-note bad rap of gangs that are in for the violence and overflowing revenge.Doga Kobo\'s in-house director Tomoaki Koshida is back from Senko-san to direct this series, and the visuals are just about as expected: replicating Yesterday wo Utatte\'s old-school palettes of art and animation to match, only this time, adding the dark mystery vibes that are associated with drama-type shows, and I have to give some good credit to the studio for a pretty good and consistent production from start to finish. Sure, there isn\'t as much Sakuga that you can cherry-pick with some decent action, but at least the action was solid, no questions asked. Good job Doga Kobo, double thumbs up.The music...is another hit-and-miss department, I\'m sad to say. I remember watching the horribly-made adaptation of ""Junji Itou: Collection"", and THE PINBALLS\'s OP ""Shichiten Battou no Blues"" (that screams ""ISOLATION DOPE!!!"") was so freaking excellent, it has remained memorable to me (even to this day). So to my amazement when ""Needle Knot"" came out, it was...OK at best. The same ""in-your-face"" bombastic quality signature of the group, but kinda missing the ""OOMPH!"" factor somewhere in between. A good effort, but nothing close to the quality that was once hearkened. And what better way to reflect the gang setting through the rapping ED by INNOSENT in FORMAL, but to be frank, the more I hear this song, the more I relinquished it as pure white noise. Their 2nd ED song ""Omou mama"" on the other hand, it\'s a calm and collected, but fantastic sounding song that I\'d wished had appeared more. Maybe it\'s my personal preference of a bias to have heart-warming songs that are in stark contrast to dark and mystical shows like this, but in this case, along with the fine line of different story plots, this payoff really worked well.In a season full of many average-to-decent (and few great) shows, this show I can only classify this as part of the middle-road package of being decent. Nothing eye-popping really stands out (other than the lore of gangs/crime aspect), and since this show hasn\'t had a clear direction (other than both start and end points), it\'s easy to be distracted by boredom, even if you tell yourself to ""stick to the end"". Let this sentence ring true: ""If it ain\'t CGDCT (which is Doga Kobo\'s work ethos), you\'re gonna be hung about a 50-50 chance of watching a good or bad show."" Nevertheless, for the 3 of you who likes gang/crime settings like Durarara!!, this is the show for you, otherwise, give this the unquoted 3-episode rule treatment.

The term gang definitely has a negative connotation, but in this series a gang is merely a group of people, that protect each other and can be hired for certain services. It actually shows that a gang can also be a good thing. Even though the gangs in the series become agressive very quickly, which is definitely a flaw that they still have, their main intentions are to make their district a better place and provide...security for thir members.I think this concept was very interesting, but the thing that definitely carried the show the most was its Main Character. The outside perspective that he has on these gangs gives the perfect angle to narrtate the story, which is honestly otherwise not that great. His role as problemsolver shows what a genuinely good guy he is. He helps people just to make sure as many of the citizens of Ikebukuro as possible are happy. And the thing that deifferentiates him the most from alll the other ""good guy"" characters is that he neither brags with his good deeds, nor does he talk excessively about his philosophy. He just helps people because he wants to and doesn´t make a big deal out of it. But he has also a very impressive side to him, which he shows in the way he solves all the problems he is confronted with. The way he makes use of his connections to all kinds of people (including the gangs) and his way of thinking make him a very cool and admirable character.That alone managed to make the series great for me. security for thir members.I think this concept was very interesting, but the thing that definitely carried the show the most was its Main Character.

Considering that Ikebukuro has exactly this same two genres, and maybe drama, as it's main highlights, it's covering a niche that is fulfilled with other shows that I consider better overall, and that makes for a pretty mild and average show for the season it's airing, and that I would only recommend for people that really like the 'street gang' vibe or that are here just to see some hot dudes having badass and beautifully animated fights...against some bad guys that no one cares. But well... the series is not unbearable either.Story - 5The anime follows episodical conflicts that somehow involve our MC, Makoto, and the street gang thematic. So far we've got some drug dealers, some vandals hired to put pressure on exploited employees of a restaurant, the cringiest youtuber that you'll see in your goddamn life and a retrospective murder case of a gang leader that was so far the best and most human. Structure of 3 first chapter is almost the same, like 'there is a trouble, we investigate the trouble, some twist happens and it ends up with the badass gang beating the shit out of the bad guys'. In the first two chapters is acceptable, and the ending scene of episode two might be the more cathartic so far in the anime, but by the third episode it got really tiring. Thankfully, it changed on chapter for so maybe we can hope for more variety on new stuff. By now, it's just mediocre.Characters - 6Excepting Youtuber-san from episode 3 that I don't even dare mentioning here, the characters are pretty neutral. I mean, they're mostly cool, and some of their design makes me really question my heterosexuality (specially Red Angels leader), but the only glimpse of development to anyone of them just showed up on episode 4, so not much to highlight here.Art - 8Doga Kobo is one of the studios that, when I see their making an anime, I'll made sure to check it out, since they almost never miss (btw two of my three favourite anime, Yesterday wo Utatte and Yuru Yuri, are produced by Doga Kobo). The studio may be mostly known by moe and comedy such as Nozaki-kun or Gabriel Dropout, and having director of Senko-san in charge of the anime must seem to confirm this impression, but they're more mature and serious style is just as good, if not better, as the moe one. Direction is not stellar, but it's incredibly solid, and animation is always consistent and fluid. The anime is not as sakuga-packed as Jujustsu Kaisen, but it does never feel lacking either, so it looks genuinely great.Sound - 8OST is very nice, specially enjoyed the jazz tracks on ep 4. Sound desing is correct too, nothing special but pretty consistent from what I noticed. The thing that made me classify sound as very good was the incredible opening, Needle Knot. The song has a punk rock style which I really enjoy and the psychodelic visuals are a great complement to it. Prossibly best op of the season.Enjoyment - 5As I said before, the anime is just fine at the best 'till now. I really disliked ep 3 but the others were a fine watch, nothing outstanding but nothing that made me drop it either.Overall - 6 against some bad guys that no one cares.

I am enjoying it with what it has so far. It maybe because I am a sucker for gangs in anime and this is around that alley. I also kind of like the real life look on things. Synthetic marijuana, possible gang beef, workforce stress. Sad to say, the youtube one as well even though that was truly awful to watch that really shows how these Youtubers are and how viewers eat it all up. That kind of ""real"" about the show is entertaining. I see why...the 3rd episode was the reason why the show was dropped but I\'m happy I watched the fourth episode. I am hoping for an actual story/plot to come along though, I\'m not a huge fan of the little stories on each episode but it could be worse. I\'ll stay hopeful and continue to watch.

I wold say this is for those who would focus on storytelling over anything else, the story is very well told and i cant wait to see what will happen next in this compelling story. Its not as fast paced as some would like but thats what makes it so good as well, you get very well developed characters with this slower pace. In my opinion this kind of storytelling us well worth watching if you...are mature and patience enough to take the time to reflect on the story. So with this anime, focus on the story, nothing else, this is a perfect piece of fiction close to the real world yet keeping the flare of being a work of fiction. As that its maybe not for everyone i can see how this would be something for me as a movie nerd rather than the casual watcher. I would strongly suggest this anime for those willing to go deep in to the story. are mature and patience enough to take the time to reflect on the story.

When I started it I figured it was \'just another gang anime\', I was sorely mistaken. It\'s about dealing with real life issues that many watching probably don\'t experience. There\'s very little linear story, it\'s more of a collaboration of short-stories told through the protagonist\'s pov.As of writing I just finished ep.5. One of my favorite points is each episode has a lesson to it, like fables (Short stories that teach a lesson). In ep5 the lesson was something akin to ""Even though where you are...may have problems, you are blessed because others have it far worse."" I found this to be very relatable.In short I think IWGP is well suited towards an older audience, and I applaud the breaking of the mold of the writers and producers. I gave it a 9 because it\'s different, and I enjoy different. may have problems, you are blessed because others have it far worse.""

It made me scream with exciment, cry(ep 9 hit hard), laugh hard. This show's got it all.The Soundtrack and the OP/ED are bangers too.The duality of Majima and the underground of Tokyo plays very nicely with the shows atmosphere and the way Majima goes about doing things is...just too satisfying. Even though the show is semi-episodic, it gave me closure after each episode and there was very noticeable character with Majima.Give this show a try and you wouldn't regret it! just too satisfying.

I pretty much only started watching it when episode 10 aired after a friend told me he was watching it and I decided to give it a shot after reading the synopsis. Here\'s my review of Ikebukuro West Gate Park.This is my first review on MAL after 4 and a bit years of using this site and I know I wanted to write one about this anime because I honestly...enjoyed the episodes I watched. Essentially, IWGP follows our mc Makoto Majima who lives in Ikebukuro and he is the Mr. Troubleshooter, going around fixing different problems. Makoto is involved with the leader of the biggest gang operating in Ikebukuro, King (Takashi Ando) and he helps them out as well while not officially being part of his gang which is called G-Boys.What I think IWGP does well in is the representation of the gang life, which I found to be relatable, as I come from an area with prominent gang activity and basically being like Makoto outside of the fact that I don\'t risk my life doing half the stuff he does. It\'s so common to see youths getting revenge on their opposition because one of their own got attacked/harmed in some way and IWGP shows this happening consistently with the turf wars between the G-Boys and the Red Angels (the main rival gang) and the G-Boys getting back at the antagonists of the episodic structure IWGP uses with Makoto dealing with different individual\'s problems. So yeah I enjoyed that.Like any series or medium, IWGP does have its cons, which I don\'t think are game changing, but hold it back from being a super good anime to me in my opinion. I mentioned earlier about IWGP\'s episodic structure of Makoto being handed a problem he has to solve and the episode is spent with him resolving that issue. That is all fine and dandy to me but the synopsis does not highlight this at all, when that\'s how the majority of IWGP. That is not the fault of the anime, but by the person/organisation that wrote the synopsis. The event where Makoto ""losing a loved one"" and the ""rising tide of violence"" doesn\'t even happen until the latter episodes, when the synopsis makes it seem like that\'s the series is going to focus on, I don\'t know, just lets my expectations down a little bit. I feel like they could\'ve spent much more episodes on that conflict when at this point, we\'ve seen a good amount of how and what Makoto does in Ikebukuro so we didn\'t need more ""Hi Makoto, I got a problem for you to solve.""Concluding here, Ikebukuro West Gate Park was a fun watch for me, I enjoyed Makoto solving problems throughout his town and how he deals handling with the chaos that ensues in Ikebukuro\'s ongoing gang activity.

Right of the start, let me be clear - it's by no means extraordinary and a must-watch, but I do think you shouldn't just skip it without giving it a try.Story 7/10The story revolves around street gangs in Ikebukuro, with the main protagonist Makoto Majima not really belonging to any of them (even though he is the best friend of the guy leading one of the gangs).Each episode so far (5 episodes as of writing this review) is a stand-alone one in terms of story, but I wouldn't...be surprised if some of them connect in the future episodes.That being said, the main tone of the stories is exploring social problems, such as bullying, overworking, discrimination, drugs... A person with a problem approaches Makoto and asks for help. The solution to the problem at times may be obvious, but the process of getting to the goal and social interactions are in the focus. Each problem is presented from several perspectives which really gives it some depth and room for thought, which is the main thing getting you invested in the show.Art 8/10The art style fits the setting. Characters have a nice and distinct design and there is some fluidity and natural feeling to their movement. The animation is consistent and at the level you'd expect for a seasonal anime.Sound 8/10While there are no soundtracks that really stand out, every scene is accompanied by a fitting one which I find most important. As an analogy, imagine sitting in a bar with someone you want to hang out and have a chat. The ambient music is welcome for the mood, but you don't want it to be distracting you from the conversation. Well, in the same sense, this music here fits just right. It gives the right vibe to the scenes, without really standing out.Character 8/10It's early in the anime, and already we have a lot of characters and each one from the main cast had some development or small side story. There are quite a few very charismatic characters and I look forward to seeing more of them. I like the approach of developing characters through specific situations, instead of just giving a backstory for each individual character.Enjoyment 8/10Regardless of the mood I find myself in at the time of watching the episodes, I enjoy watching them.Overall 8/10There are a lot of shows coming out this season, and I wouldn't really say that this one stands out as something special, but the same could be said about a lot of the other ones as well. I feel that the overall quality of anime has skyrocketed in the past few years, making the standards higher then they should be.I personally try to judge the anime I watch in the context of what it wants to accomplish, and not by comparing it to others, as I really think that each story is it's own thing and can't be easily compared to another one. Basically, it's just a matter of expectations. I have certain expectations for the show I'm watching based on how much potential the initial setting provides.

The synopsis sounded amazing. Quote: ""Crime-ridden Ikebukuro is a haven for violent gangs, the Yakuza, and home to Makoto Majima -- when a rising tide of violence results in Makoto losing a loved one, can he ride out the storm, or will he drown in all the spilled blood that floods his streets?""Does that not sound amazing? Gang warfare, intrigue, mystery, blood and violence. Complicated criminal and gang activities while following the perspective of a 3rd party. And while there were certainly moments that had aspects of this, they\'re incredibly...watered down. To the point of near non-existence. And what little there was had such wasted potential. It wasn\'t bad, but there\'s very little I could recommend. Very much style over substance, and it will not leave a lasting impression.In summary, I would not recommend this anime. It\'s mediocre personified at best and a let down at worst. For a spoiler free explanation and recommendation for similar anime, please continue reading.From what I understand, IWGP was an urban mystery novel produced in the late 90\'s. And again going by the synopsis I figured this sounds like a great premise for an anime. My major worry however came when I read the synopsis above, and saw the show with no rating (I believe this has since changed to PG-13). There was a massive disconnect to what was happening in the show and what the description of both the original novel and anime. Ultimately this had led to the disappointment that most will feel when thinking back on this show. This however was not the only negative I found when watching. The actual structure of the anime was in my opinion, lacking. For a 12 episode anime I was expecting rather tight story telling. But after finishing I feel like I\'ve watched 9 episodes of fluff and filler (emphasis on the fluff as a lot of these episodes completely contradict the synopsis), and barely 3 episodes of the main story. And I say the story very loosely as most of it was pushed through in post episode narration. A lot of it was told at the end of an episode through exposition and flash forward. There was no time given to reflect or to think about what had happened and effects these may have. But worse is that most episodes had no lasting effect or any play in future episodes. It was very episodic in nature.Further to this, it felt like the story was shrink-wrapped down and only the bare minimum was allowed to seep through the cracks. There is a wide cast of interesting looking characters. Perhaps in the novel these are expanded upon but in this show they are mostly for window dressing. I couldn\'t really tell you any of their names other than the MC, and even the ones that appear more regularly are not given any time to be fleshed out or explained. At most, they are just there to turn the tide over while the story is told around them. There was a lot of wasted potential here.I wouldn\'t say the entire show was bad. The art direction was OK with interesting characters and the show had a catchy intro and outro. That being said I wouldn\'t say there was anything standout, and any BGM playing throughout the show is forgettable.In all I was hoping for a lot more but in the end they were all dashed. I was hoping for an in-depth look at interesting characters in a gang warfare setting. There was very little of that latter and the parts we got to see were not that interesting. I was hoping that the episodic and sporadic nature of the show would come together for an amazing ending. While it did try to do that with the final 2 episodes, it again felt rushed and wasted compared to what it could have been.I can not recommend this anime to anyone interested in it unless they have a lot of time, and even then I would likely say to watch something else. For an alternate recommendation I would go with:Banana Fish - Similar setting with gang warfare and intrigue, but a slower paced feel giving you time to breathe.

I wasn't sure what I'd make of it. Turns out, the answer to that is quite a lot.Conceptually, this is pretty simple. It's a show about gangs in Ikebukuro, a guy working as a troubleshooter doing his best to keep the peace, and solving the various problems that get pointed at him on a regular basis. There's plenty of fun to be had with this premise. Think 'Durarara!!' without any of the fantastical aspects. And those parts are well done. Ikebukuro feels like a well-fleshed out...setting, with the titular park being a great central location, and the other recurring settings feeling lived-in and distinct. The two main gangs we see both feel like they have some substance to them, we get to know a handful of members of each, and generally find everyone interesting and likeable. The two leaders, Takashi and Kyoichi, feel unique and distinct, and both the mutual frustration and respect they have for each other is really compelling.And, of course, there's our protagonist Makoto, the man who stands in the middle of all of it and makes sure it doesn't blow up in everyone's faces. He's perhaps not the most unique protagonist in the world, but he still fits the bill perfectly; charming, caring, a little awkward, but incredibly smart in the ways he needs to be, always coming to the best solution to any problem. It doesn't always quite go to plan, but he makes the best out of bad situations and always comes out on top.With all of that, there's a clear and simple show that comes out of it, which is, in a lot of ways, more or less what you'd expect. But, as I watched it, I found something sitting under the surface, and I find it absolutely fascinating.Because this show, about the grimy world of crime, about gangs and con-artists and hitmen, manages to be one of the most wonderfully kind-hearted shows I've seen in a very long time.I know that sounds ridiculous, but, honestly, what this show is about, more than anything else, is empathy. That's probably the key thing that I tactically ignored that makes Makoto the protagonist he is; a deep sense of wanting to understand people, and an acceptance of who they are. Through that, the show engages with a variety of social issues; immigrant workers' rights, the difficulties of single parenting, far-right nationalism, as well as taking a nuanced look at themes of justice and crime and forgiveness; hell, it even takes time at one point to specifically state the validity of sex work as a form of legitimate labour. It's a small thing, but I don't think I've ever seen that in an anime before. Maybe not a TV showAnd what all of this gives us is a show that is deeply invested in some really important ideas; be curious about people, do what you can to learn about them, and there are no misunderstandings that can't be cleared up. This show about small-time gangs is about empathy, and about the importance of seeing things from someone else's perspective, about learning to accept others for what they are and learning to live in community together. To make a show about criminals, about people at the fringes of society who don't always behave in ways we can entirely approve of, and to make it about the reality that humans are so much more than 'good' or 'evil', that even hardened street thugs can be people you can understand and accept... It's the sort of story you don't see often. It's certainly not the story I was expecting.Honestly, I think that this messy show about messy people living messy lives is, in its own way, kind of radical. And it's the sort of show I want to see more often. setting, with the titular park being a great central location, and the other recurring settings feeling lived-in and distinct. The two main gangs we see both feel like they have some substance to them, we get to know a handful of members of each, and generally find everyone interesting and likeable. The two leaders, Takashi and Kyoichi, feel unique and distinct, and both the mutual frustration and respect they have for each other is really compelling.And, of course, there's our protagonist Makoto, the man who stands in the middle of all of it and makes sure it doesn't blow up in everyone's faces. He's perhaps not the most unique protagonist in the world, but he still fits the bill perfectly; charming, caring, a little awkward, but incredibly smart in the ways he needs to be, always coming to the best solution to any problem. It doesn't always quite go to plan, but he makes the best out of bad situations and always comes out on top.With all of that, there's a clear and simple show that comes out of it, which is, in a lot of ways, more or less what you'd expect. But, as I watched it, I found something sitting under the surface, and I find it absolutely fascinating.Because this show, about the grimy world of crime, about gangs and con-artists and hitmen, manages to be one of the most wonderfully kind-hearted shows I've seen in a very long time.I know that sounds ridiculous, but, honestly, what this show is about, more than anything else, is empathy. That's probably the key thing that I tactically ignored that makes Makoto the protagonist he is; a deep sense of wanting to understand people, and an acceptance of who they are. Through that, the show engages with a variety of social issues; immigrant workers' rights, the difficulties of single parenting, far-right nationalism, as well as taking a nuanced look at themes of justice and crime and forgiveness; hell, it even takes time at one point to specifically state the validity of sex work as a form of legitimate labour. It's a small thing, but I don't think I've ever seen that in an anime before.

Having a main character helping out delinquents and the like despite not being a part of a gang himself was super-intriguing.The layout of the eipsodes was nice where one person got help each episode. And they still mangaed to tie the episodes together for a wholesome storyline that made sense. Many people we got to see again and it was nice to see they hadn\'t been discarded immediately as supportive characters when they had fulfilled their purpose in one episode.They went back and forth with different issues and morals and showed how thoughtless actions can have (very) severe...consequences.The characters felt realistic despite the fact that they exist in a different world, in the sense that they are mostly a violent bunch of delinquents. They weren\'t ""just"" violent, but could show kindness and reason with people which I like since sometimes characters only show one side to themselves, and that\'s not realistic at all imoho.There were few parts I didn\'t appreciate as much, but all in all, Makoto made a super nice main character that was levelheaded pretty much all the time. It was a nice breath of fresh air. Their design was nice and the colour scheme of the gangs, while kind of classic now, spiced it up.I recommend it a lot ♥ consequences.The characters felt realistic despite the fact that they exist in a different world, in the sense that they are mostly a violent bunch of delinquents.

I feel it had potential to be very good, but in the end, it didn\'t. That being said, this is still a decent show, that could potentially be enjoyable for many (either way, OP bangs, so at least check that out~)The story is relatively straightforward. We have our MC who is involved with a gang (but not actually a part of it). You get introduced to some interesting characters, and then you see some examples of the ways our MC helps Ikebukuro with the help of his connections that...he has for some reason. Except that ends up being the entire show. Every episode, we get a new problem come up, or a new person to help, and Makoto (the MC) works to solve them. Rinse and repeat. Some of these solved issues end up being somewhat relevant in the future, in the sense that some character interactions develop, but that is essentially limited to small interactions. Their influence on the overall arc (which exists, don\'t get me wrong) is relatively small. Thus, this is essentially a slice of life, following someone that has a bit of an uncommon daily life. I will add that there are some pretty dark themes, which you may expect from a setting involving gangs, but it gets quite serious in some episodes, so keep that in mind. So at this point, you can gauge whether or not you would enjoy this. I was expecting this to be a longer story where we\'d be able to explore the setting and the characters because that was the vibe I felt from the first episode. If you are expecting something like that, then you\'ll be disappointed. However, if you go into this knowing that the format will in fact be essentially a slice of life, then you may get more enjoyment out of the show, because there are things to like about it.Because of the set up of the show, we don\'t end up with any actual fleshed out characters. Actually, that may be slightly wrong. There are actually some character development, but it\'s pretty much entirely reserved for the side characters who are helped in each episode. They may start with a problem, and develop and grow by the end of it. And then we don\'t see them again for the most part. But the actual main characters don\'t change much. They are pretty interesting, but we don\'t learn enough about them, so realistically, they end up being a bit bland. The setting itself was interesting, and there are many moving parts in the background that culminate in the final arc (which is two episodes), but I don\'t personally feel like enough was done in the setting.So, should you watch this show?

On one hand, it explores serious real-world issues like racism, but on the other hand, it attempts to fit those conflicts and tell episodic stories with its diverse cast of characters that can sometimes hit home greatly, or miss by a long shot.Story-wise, IWGP is an interesting take on the “gang” genre. The main character gets involved with different kinds of conflicts and attempts to resolve them without using forceful methods for the most part, but occasionally seeks help from his friend, who is the leader of a gang, to help him out when things aren’t...smooth-sailing. These conflicts are certainly great choices to tell multiple stories that happen in Ikebukuro, but there are times where it feels as if the episodes that tackle some of these conflicts feel like they are lacking the extra punch or “oomph” to really give viewers an impact that will be felt long after the ED plays, save for a few that are actually pretty solid because it does have that extra punch like the two-episode arcs.On the positive side, IWGP’s characters feel grounded to reality, which makes sense as this anime basically is grounded too. Their experiences in life mostly revolve around the conflicts that the episode tackles, which is a good way to set up the mood of the episode. While on the topic of characters, the main character, Makoto, fights for justice and will use any means necessary so long as violence is avoided for the most part. Aside from that, he also empathizes with those who seek help from him and help them out to make Ikebukuro a better place. Of course, there are characters that are one-dimensional, but they are mostly just there for the plot and are unimportant for the most part. One drawback, however, is that I don’t really feel interested or invested with some of the characters, but for most of the time, they manage to keep my interest.Moving on to its art and music, it’s certainly not bad. Its minimalistic take on its character designs reminds me of another anime from this year from Doga Kobo, which is Sing “Yesterday” for Me. Speaking of Sing “Yesterday”, IWGP is kind of similar to it in a way that it doesn’t really use too much music aside from a few scenes, which makes me more focused with its dialogue and what’s happening on the screen. Now while all these things sound positive, I think that overall, there is really nothing to write home about with IWGP in terms of art and music, as I think it doesn’t really make enough effort in order for it to at least let its art and music stick with me.In conclusion, Ikebukuro West Gate Park is neither a great nor bad show. It is simply an “okay” show from Doga Kobo, and here’s to hoping that they manage to produce great shows in the future. Would I recommend it? If you have the patience, I’d say go for it, as there are certainly aspects of the show where I can see people enjoy it, but if you don’t have the patience, it would be in your best interest to skip it, as you are not really missing out on a ton.

People came in expecting action, violence, and romance and got neither of those things and so they didn't waste time downvoting it. By the time I started watching, which was around the time of airing 3rd or 4th episode, the score was already well below 7, which was unfair at that point in time.Durarara comparison also did not help. While the two shows are not that similar, one thing connects them, the unity of the characters. Even if the two characters do not know each other, certain Ikebukuro rules connect them, and it seems like...everyone living there is a part of something bigger. The difference here is that in Durarara, we watch as those relationships grow, while in IWGP most relationships are already established.The story follows one of the best protagonists in fiction, young Makoto, who uses said relationships to help people in need.Every episode follows a similar route: trouble-> Makoto is asked to help the person in trouble -> conclusion. During the helping part, we are introduced to various characters, who mainly serve as a helping hand to Makoto and his troubled customers.For the most part, everything was super enjoyable, every episode had its own unique story with unique characters, and with every episode, you gain more respect towards Makoto. Willingness to sacrifice your time, body, and mind to help someone you don't know, and to fight for justice should be the highest quality a person can have. Makoto has it, and because of that, every person we meet is ready to help him. That is the enjoyable part. It is nice to see a good person getting respect and rewards for his actions.Unfortunately, the fun stops at the second to last episode, a strong contender for the stupidest episode of all time. It was a wish come true for those demanding gang fights and violence. At some point, trouble was expected, but the way it was executed was ridiculous. It's like Saika came and stabbed everyone and everyone became brainwashed, and the only thing they can think about is violence. Relationships that were established both previously and during the show were no longer there, and almost all of the likable characters immediately became unlikable.The last episode was much better, as it fixed some of those things. It was still quite stupid and felt rushed, but at least it was enjoyable.Score by episodes:Episodes 1 to 10 - 10Episode 11 - 1Episode 12 - 6It's unfortunate that the most important episodes are the last ones.

Until the final act the series consists of a bunch of smaller stories from each episode woven into each other and connecting with re-occurring characters etc.Some of the stories also tackle underlying problems in society (main focus on Japan ofc) and humans. Of course it’s also made to be enjoyable to watch but the underlying themes are still there.The art itself is a stylistic view on gangs with bright colors and exaggerated leaders. The leader of the G-Boys walks around in a dress all the time while...the leader of the Red Angels dances ballet in his free time.But it still manages to hit that sweet spot between stylistic but not over the top unrealistic costumes/ gang attire.The characters are sometimes very well written and sometimes cliche but they work good together overall.When I initially went to the MAL review page I saw many lukewarm reviews of this anime.

The reason might be because it is easy going(slow pace). The show somewhat highlights the problems faced by very highly developed cities/country. The Fight scene are dynamic too. I loved the ""Smoking Kills"" T-shirt of Makoto (which was funny). There is not any romantic moments at all, so those who are looking for some romance this might not be  for you. Its the must watch if you love slow anime. My favourite character will Majima Makoto(obviously). Makoto Does not any special...fighting skills but he has the ability to make friends very quickly.

So here ya go, ezra_aket.Story: 5There is no central story for this series. 8 episodes in and it is like each episode is a stand alone story, which I guess makes sense since this is based off a series of novels about a guy that mediates for his local gang and solves their problems. That\'s it. the mc is given a task, he investigates task, and he solves task. Rinse and repeat for every. Single. Episode. There is not a single centered plot in this whole show to...get attached to.Art: 7I will give it this. The art is probably the best part of the show. It is well drawn and animated. The only thing I can really sat this series has going for it.Sound: 6Honestly I never know how to score this subject. Sound is decent. It sounds fine.Character: 5Okay here is something I can give a better analysis. Characters in this look cool but I haven\'t learned anything about any of them besides their basic info. I feel like if you have to be a fan of the book series to really enjoy this because I know absolutely nothing about Makoto and his acquaintances.Why is he friends with Takashi?

There is some flavour missing here, some crispiness there... not too much, but you notice it subconciously.The themes are great. The MC is nice and has a quirk (he orders everything he eats with fruits, his Ramen looks like a fruit salad), the side characters are interesting...But sometimes the pacing is off, sometimes it's the delivery of the plot twist - sometimes the whole motivation of some characters.It's a 6/10 for me - above average, but not much.

While still being about that, it also included very real and current issues humanity faces. It has a great story and switches it up every episode, while each smaller story still relates to the whole. It shows how gangs are not always violent, and how they do care about the place they occupy. If you want an anime with good feels, this is it. It has been portrayed as a hard core violence however, it is a well thought out show with twist and turns and a very good show ', '*spolier free*This anime isn\'t for your run of the mill gang violence media lovers. Imho it offers some insight on how everything works in japanMost of the negative stuff I see is ""muh where r the guns"" or why are they peaceful but gang violence in Japan is almost never as violent as it is in the west and that can be seen in this anime as well.The characters could use some more development imho, there was so much left unsaid but I\'m assuming we\'re going to get more in the future.From the technical side(art sound and animation) everything is up to par with what...you would expect in a modern anime you would expect in a modern anime', ""Okay so this was the first anime that I actually read the reviews for before watching, and based off of the reviews I was debating on whether I should even give it the time of day.

I saw some reviews saying this anime was the worst thing ever made, some saying the exact opposite and some in the middle.I would say it's kind of in the middle for me. I say that just because the storyline was...a little shaky in the begging, but it came together pretty decent in the last two episodes.

After episode 3, I knew I should\'ve listened to my gut and drop the series because of how mediocre each episode was. But I still kept watching it because I expected the plot to go into the gang aspect of the story. What I got, in the end, were redundant PSA episodes, characters that have one-note personalities, and a very lackluster and disappointing ending.Story (3/10)Right off the bat, IWGP had the potential to be a good show with Makoto acting as a mediator between the G-Boys and the Red Angels. Two rival gangs could cause a turf war...and Makoto being the only one who can stop it from happening. However, instead of gang wars, we got PSA episodes telling us how society is all kinds of messed up and that weed is bad and getting YouTube clout is bad. Why? From the synopsis, the story sounded dark but it turned out to be a total lie, and instead, we got Makoto being everyone\'s errand boy that had little to do with gangs or even the G-Boys and the Red Angels. Episode 3 is by far the worst episode because of how cringey it was that the producers were trying to be up to date with the youth by making an episode about a YouTuber. As the story went on, I realized something: There is no conflict. Whatever conflict there is, it\'s solved quickly like it was never there to begin with. Only 4 episodes had some type of conflict but they were done quickly that it feels rushed.I say each episode is like a PSA because they are and that\'s what really ruined the anime for me. Not to mention each episode talking about whatever PSA it was is only surface level. I expected an anime about gangs, not watch PSA episodes.Characters (3/10)Along with the story, I had issues with the characters. Everyone is so one-dimensional and boring. Makoto is a random fruit seller that everyone goes to for help and to solve their problems for some reason and it\'s never explored why he\'s the way he is. Personally, Makoto is the textbook definition of a Gary-Stu. He\'s so boring yet he does all these things and manages to resolve problems no other person could. He\'s never shown any development and remains the same all the way in the end. He\'s just so boring.The anime also has the gang leaders, Takashi and Kyouichi. A.K.A. The most useless gang leaders I have ever seen. Both Takashi and Kyouichi are the equivalent of the Tuxedo Mask meme from Sailor Moon where Tuxedo Mask says ""my job here is done"" and Usagi says ""But you didn\'t do anything."" Takashi and Kyouichi are Tuxedo Mask and Makoto is Usagi. Makoto does all the leg work for the both of them and yet they are these respected gang leaders when in reality they do nothing. If anything, they\'re laughably bad with how poorly written they are.The side characters aren\'t really that interesting either. Literally, one of them is used for plot convenience in 2 episodes and is otherwise forgettable. The same can be said with just about everyone else.Art (5/10)The art isn\'t really something to write home about nor is it bad. I thought it was decent enough.Sound (5/10)The OP and ED songs are the highlight of the anime. The rest of it was kind of forgettable.Overall (3/10)Ikebukuro West Gate Park is a disappointment. It failed to deliver in a lot of ways in regards to the plot. The characters are all one-note characters with no backstory to either of them, and the show overall was mediocre at best. Not the worst show but it could\'ve been better. I would recommend (if possible) to watch the TV show instead. If there is one anime I recommend (aside from the obvious recommendation of Durarara), I would say watch Akudama Drive. Akudama Drive makes IWGP look like a slice of life. If you want fights, interesting characters and plot, then Akudama Drive is one I would recommend.What else can I say about IWGP other than it was a disappointment. and Makoto being the only one who can stop it from happening.

Being settled in one of the most rough neighborhoods in Tokio it may come up as unoriginal when covering the ""gang"" concept. It has nothing that stands out, but it was smart about...that too. If the story was being focused on the main characters and their stories it would probably be really boring, but it doesn\'t. IWGP adds an slice of life format with everyday stories, everyday drama, all scattered around many people. From long time inhabitants, to turists from outside and inside of Japan, so we don\'t have to think of just one person that is just casually involved in many events of his life, rather an outsider that just wants to get to know these events. If you want action and deep mystery, this is not the anime you need. But that doesn\'t make it bad, a slow paced story with unrelated events each episode is a format really common in the slice of life genre and is executed smoothly in IWGP.ABOUT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:The only characters we meet regularly and actually get some backstory from are the ones who are actually interesting. Not everybody has this dramatic and intense backstory. Look at Makoto, our protagonist, he is too basic of a guy when we talk about backstory but he\'s still an educated, humble and really caring human being.ABOUT THE OPENING SEQUENCE: 「NEEDLE KNOT」The song ain\'t a masterpiece but it\'s really fitting, since it describes Ikebukuro as that place you know is not paradise, but you love because of that. I believe that it\'s really fun nonetheless. The art and animation ain\'t great either, but investing on a really neat and elaborated opening sequence would\'ve made this apply to ""The Best Opening of the Year"", but it ended as wasted potential. The scenery references a lot of elements of the anime and of the real Ikebukuro neighborhood, the melting pot created makes it realistic without branching far off the plot.ABOUT THE ENDING SEQUENCE:「AFTER SONG」「OMŌ MAMA」「BŌKYAKU NO SORA」They all have a really similar vibe to them but it\'s again really smart how the animation has really sutile changes dependeing on the episode and how it ends.

First of all the synopsis for this series isnt quite reflected on the episodes. Only 4 or 5 episodes are about the struggle between the local gangs the other are about the so called middle man Makoto doing choirs for local residents or immigrants. There is not the drama implied in the description. Also action is limited and the episodes arent well connected with each other. In the end the anime isnt horrible but dont have high expectations for it. It could have been much much better. ', ""Look, I know this isn't one of the most well liked animes out there and maybe its just me but I really enjoyed the limited storyline and quick story that Ikebukuro West Gate Park provided us with.Yes, I do admit there is a lot, and I mean a LOT of 'filler' episodes for this 12 episode anime but I think that we the community are looking at this anime through a wrong scope. Instead of judging it based on our conventional, 'is this good bc of the storyline/art/enjoyment/sound...' we should be looking at it like how we look at classical art:What does the director...want us to see in this?Personally, I feel that if you looks at this anime through a more artsy lens and try to find and theorise deeper meanings of this anime, we can come back with a different (and hopefully) more positive review.Side Note:I love Takashi Ando, best character in the anime :) want us to see in this?Personally, I feel that if you looks at this anime through a more artsy lens and try to find and theorise deeper meanings of this anime, we can come back with a different (and hopefully) more positive review.Side Note:I love Takashi Ando, best character in the anime :)"", 'Blue or Red?Ikebukuro West Gate Park was what I\'ve expected, an anime engaged with gangs, drugs and some mysteries but it lacks a little bit in storytelling.This has his own formula, a problem, our main character searches info and then he resolve the mystery but in the process we see a sneak peek ok what it\'s behind the curtains.The problem, the behind the curtains is not well polished and feels forced.The rivalry between G-Boys and Red Angels is good but it\'s not well confectioned like the internal problems of the G-Boys.Instead of that is more like a Scooby Doo episode, a mystery and a bad...guy who is guilty of something in sort way.The art has his charm, I don\'t feel it\'s too special but the bright colors on the gangs and the colorful city is well made it.

Does that mean the show is bad? of course not. IWGP is very consistent in its overall tone, theme, and pacing. It is essentially more a-kin to Slice-of-Life then a hardcore gritty crime drama with its more light-hearted approach and easy going style. Yet it still takes itself serious enough to contain multiple climaxes, Interwoven mysteries, payoffs, and a satisfying ending. Yes its not trying to replicate the emotional weight of something on the scale of AoT, and that's fine not every...story needs to be like AoT to be good.So overall the anime is very good I had a great time with it and I'd recommend it to anyone. story needs to be like AoT to be good.So overall the anime is very good I had a great time with it and I'd recommend it to anyone."", ""The one thing that stands out the most in the anime is the music, it's catchy rhythmic, and unlike many others this anime season. Outside of the music most if not all parts were mediocre.Problem 1, i.e. the most fatal hit for this anime has to be it's episodic nature. Episodic shows need to carry weight with each installment, either the setup, the characters, or the audiences feelings have to change. When you fail to accomplish any of the three, you fail as an episodic show. For example the setup should've changed with the new adopted sister, especially with the past she has. But no,...she's only a sister in name, her every appearance afterwards could just be concerned passerby A  ,with the extra line of oniisan or something. The lack of emotional fallout, or comedy, or excitement made most episodes dull, so if nothing really changes in the set up and the characters, and the emotional pay off is only once a blue moon it becomes hard to be invested.Problem 2, most if not all the supporting and main characters are static. At the end of this show I still couldn't tell you anything about Makoto or Takashi, not even the basic his dreams are, he fears, he reason for his behavior is . These things are the staples of any character. Without them you could replace stick figures without names and the story would still flow the same.Problem 3, masked as a plus, would have to be the story. The story tries too much, I can understand why. It wants to have an array of character, it wants to make Ikebukuro feel like the wild west. It wants to match that psychedelic feeling the opening gives. It wants to touch on a variety of topics with a vast array of opinions. But what no one seemed to realize, is that there is not enough time or money to achieve whatever the hell you want. Gang fights are interesting, so are drug businesses and cartels, the mafia is super interesting. There is so much that when you throw them all together in the stew you get gray sludge. That's the problem. Though the plus, has to at least be that it's inspired, that it wants to do something. I think that's the reason I stuck out so long and watched so far because even if the characters were static and the art standard, even if some episodes are so boring. The author/writer/director added a certain, I don't know how to explain it, mood that made me feel some kind of hope that something might develop and come to full form. I had that feeling till the last episode.If you ask me, I can tell I'm being picky, it's not bad, it's certainty not good. If anything I feel it's perfect as background noise when you farm. But I feel that way because I though maybe this could be the next Durarara or Baccano, something like xxxHolic, or Mononoke., or even maybe Natsume Yujinchou. Interesting , and unique.

And the relative ease in which a kid has so many connections that even the police is at his beck and call.

Also, before you watch it, please keep in mind that back then marijuana was considered one of the worst drugs and that is revelant to the show.In any case, the summary I mentioned isn\'t wrong but at the same time I don\'t think it\'s entirely accurate. The story is indeed about Makoto who belongs to one...of the gangs and his goal in life appears to maintain the peace around Ikebukuro. The thing is, it isn\'t just about the gangs and its members but also about the regular citizens and their stories.I was excited about this anime mostly because japan + gangs to me equals yakuza but that couldn\'t be farther from this series. I was sort of disappointed with it at the beginning but what truly stopped me from enjoying the show was how disconnected I felt from the characters and what was happening with them. 90% of the time I was in a constant state of ""meh"".I like the visuals and the soundtrack is fine. However, I don\'t agree with some of the casting choices and it has nothing to do whether a rookie or a veteran seiyuu got hired for each particular character.The only episodes that I truly enjoyed was the 10th and 11th ones but the ending was a let down.

It is a crime detective in which a troubleshooter Majima Makoto, who is a friend of the leaders of local gangs, investigates different criminal incidents to resolve conflicts and to save tranquility in Ikebukuro.So, let's disassemble this anime point by point.1. Plot. How I told before, main character Majima Makoto is the troubleshooter, who acts as an intermediary between various semi-criminal gangs and the police. At first sight, the conflicts he resolves are not connected. The...first 10 episodes can be viewed as separate, unrelated. Only at the end of the series the plot become integral, separate episodes add up to a single plot. On the way to the final – I do not say, is it happy or not – there will be many scandals, intrigues, investigations. I can say that the denouement seems logical and it is really difficult to predict. I did not predict the denouement.Plot – 9 points.2. Characters. Of course, the main protagonist is elaborate better than others. His motives and reasons for actions are clear to me. He acts like a real living person. He evokes sympathy and compassion or even admiration.Two other main characters and all minor heroes are less elaborate and understandable. However, they are recognizable. They do not merge. For example, Ozaki Kyouichi does not evoke any emotions. But he must. However, it does not interfere with the plot.Characters – 7 points.3. Animation, Art. It does not evoke rejection. Fights probably look boring, but realistic. Although the faces, (with the exception of the main character) all seem familiar. It also does not interfere with the plot. We are not bothered by the repetitive faces in the movies, are we?Animation – 7 points.4. Music. Well, it exists. I am not good at music for anime. I found a track from the ending theme for myself.5. In conclusion. Would I recommend watching this anime? Of course. But not for those who want something like Durarara!! IWGP is not so humorous, mystical, emotional. It's a completely different genre. I would recommend this anime to detective lovers. You will definitely enjoy it!Enjoyment – 9 points. first 10 episodes can be viewed as separate, unrelated.

Moshidora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9693/Moshidora,"['As the person who wrote the recommendation for bartender so cleverly recognized, this anime is not really about sports or baseball. Baseball is simply the medium in which the main message is conveyed.The plot of the story: ""What happens when you apply business management strategies to baseball""? A normal highschool girl who wants to help her friend achieve the dream of taking their baseball team to the koshien picks up a book on management, and uses its principles to managing the team.Unlike other anime that draws excitement from having one or more ""godly"" protagonists who are somehow able to always pull through by...luck or some mystical force, Moshidora focuses on real principles that can really be applied in real life, with characters that don\'t have any special abilities other than hard work.This anime is unique in that one looks not towards the ending of the anime, but the process. While the viewer is curious whether the team made it to the koshien, it is not the most important part of the anime; what is important is how everyone changed and improved by living with the principles of ""Management"". Indeed, the principles of ""Management"" not only changed their baseball team, but also their perspectives on life.As explained in episode three, a key concept in ""Management"" is to allow the consumers to understand professional jargon; this anime does this perfectly. It explains principles in business in a simple and light manner by expressing it through anime.If you\'re looking for a dramatic sports drama, this may not be for you. But this anime is wonderful in that it is not only pleasant, it also teaches valuable principles that everyone should apply in their lives. luck or some mystical force, Moshidora focuses on real principles that can really be applied in real life, with characters that don\'t have any special abilities other than hard work.This anime is unique in that one looks not towards the ending of the anime, but the process.

But this anime is wonderful in that it is not only pleasant, it also teaches valuable principles that everyone should apply in their lives.', '\'Moshidora\' is based on a best selling Japanese novel (translated) \'What If the Girl Manager of a High School Baseball Team Read Drucker\'s ""Management""?\' I am not making this up, the title really is that long. The anime title is an abbreviation.The novel may have swept No.1 spot in every major book ranking chart in Japan with over 2.5 million copies sold in less than a year and half, but the anime adaptation is nothing but complete and utter failure.One can tell how badly this show was neglected within minutes. Almost all the characters and backgrounds are nearly frozen! Not only that, there is absolutely...zero creativity in art direction, as almost every single scene is either a standstill medium shot, standstill full shot, or moving long shot. It\'s like watching a slideshow.Voice acting is almost equally lackluster. All the characters talk in an unusually slow pace, completely devoid of emotion. I don\'t know about you, but this is what I call ""reading the script"".Of course, not every series is going to get \'Seirei no Moribito\' or \'Dennou Coil\' treatment and get showered with taxpayer money, but daily broadcast with production value lower than that of \'Anpanman\' is no way to treat a No.1 yearly best seller. Just because it\'s an educational show on NHK doesn\'t mean it has to be garbage as an anime, and more importantly, it should not be teaching wrong things.*Spoiler begins here*The concept of running a baseball team like a business is nothing new. Actually, it\'s a pretty common theme in coach/management side of sports drama. \'Moshidora\' is unique in that it specifies a single book and focuses on select concepts, but this presents a new set of problems. What happens is that the protagonist basically picks up Peter Drucker\'s ""Management"", then becomes a mindless drone who literally follows every single teaching on the book as if it really was the life\'s Bible. Last time I checked, management was an art that has best practices, but not an instruction manual!Peter Drucker\'s book for a high school team is a very poor choice, because his books are written mainly for large corporations and nonprofits (like the Red Cross), whose ultimate goal is profit (or raising funds). That\'s why the concepts introduced in this series are like ""organizations should be socially responsible"", or ""employee responsibility fosters morale/motivation"" etc, that large corporations often neglect. It\'s also why the book focuses a lot on importance of marketing, because raising customer awareness and building lasting relationship with customers ultimately accomplish large organization\'s objectives. On the other hand, high school baseball team is a small organization, and their success is not measured by number of fans and revenue generated, but how far they advance into the tournament. This organizational objective was defined in one of the earlier episodes by the protagonist, to win. Marketing is not required to achieve that goal.There were some interesting application of theories to a baseball team, but also stupid mistakes like confusing marketing with internal marketing and HRM (Human Resources Management). However, there were also many instances where things went way too conveniently just to prove the concept works. Especially, the application of ""Innovation"" was absolutely retarded. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows that guessing the type and location of the pitch is more than half the challenges a batter has to face against a pitcher. By pitching nothing but strikes, you\'re voluntarily abandoning the location aspect of guesswork, essentially allowing batters to swing every pitch without hesitation. Such a strategy would never work, unless the pitcher was a prodigy who throws at 100mph or nasty breaking balls with startling precision (he was not). And the opposing team is still surprised at the regional semifinals that they don\'t bunt? No, they would send scouts to spy on opposing teams way before reaching that far.Baseball aside, it didn\'t even make sense from business management perspective. ""Innovation"" from management and HR perspective is not telling your employees never-seen-before strategy and have them to follow that. It\'s about creating an environment for employees that encourages innovation. 3M\'s Post-it Notes and Google\'s ""20 percent time"" are probably the most famous examples. Creation of strict employee guideline by upper management, and blindly following a single book as a manager is not ""innovation"" from the management perspective.While excessive fantasy is acceptable, sometimes even preferred in sports drama, using inconceivable scenarios to demonstrate a business concept is not the way to educate. The thing with business concept is that it must be used on a case-by-case basis, a strategy that works for one firm does not work for another. There are hundreds of theories and many influential business theorists around. A manager\'s job is to determine which strategy should be used for their own organization, and how it should be implemented. By forcibly twisting the outcome in order to demonstrate a theory, the lesson becomes invalid.I was actually watching this series with a faint hope that the protagonist would eventually decide to abandon the book. To my surprise, it actually happened, but in the most undramatic way imaginable. No matter how you think about it, she should\'ve strayed from the book after the eye-opening event of a best friend\'s death, at the very climax where she ended up pointlessly trying to convince the coach not to change the batter. That would\'ve been solid drama, maybe even teach a real lesson from the story. In the end, the show severely underplayed the realization of the book\'s limits, and missed the chance to show that one must choose what she believes is right rather than blindly following a manual, or should I call it ""innovation in management"". As it stands, the choice of keeping the batter who eventually hit the winning run seems like yet another convenient scriptwriting. It also appears to be done on her whim, as they were still living by the book after regional finals. It didn\'t even make sense they\'re trying to play the way ""customer"" wants, when they\'re not even a professional team that plays for direct revenue and fan base. Apparently the producers of this show didn\'t understand the concept of organizational objective because they only read ""Management"". The climax, that fake swing sequence was extremely clever and dramatic, using canny plot device in earlier episode. Unfortunately, it\'s too little too late by this point.Characters in this show are just puppets. Their emotions are limited, their behaviors are fabricated to advance the story (I mean, what was with the protagonist\'s reaction in front of the team after her friend\'s death? ""Can\'t read the atmosphere,"" as the Japanese call it, beyond belief). To be honest, I forgot all their names already, because I simply was not even close to connecting or caring about any of them.*Spoiler ends here*OP by Azusa stood out as the only good thing about this series. \'Yume Note\' is an extremely touching and catchy Jpop song perfect for what little atmosphere this series had. She\'s definitely setting herself up to become the next anime song princess in my opinion, with three consecutive solid theme songs in row, previous two being \'Amagami SS\' OPs.I do sense some clever writing by the original author, but I am going to single this one out as the worst anime adaptation attempt ever, and the worst sports anime I\'ve ever encountered. Not only did it lack entertainment value as a sports anime, it failed miserably as a tool of business education, and serves only as the glorification of Peter Drucker and his book.

There are no ""power ups"" and the characters are very human.Story (9):  A key concept to this anime is applying business theory to managing a baseball team.  For example ""Marketing"" is useful to the team because people can find beneficial interactions (e.g. joint practice with track team).  I think this concept is executed well enough though.  It is slow but every development makes sense. The pacing actually reminds me more of cross game than one outs or major although...there is little if any romance in Moshidora.  Perhaps this is a side effect from being an adaptation to a novel.  Nonetheless, this plot driven anime accomplished so much more than most anime do in a full season.Art(7): The art is average, nothing good or bad really drew my attention.Sound(6): I did not like the strange soundtrack played when the anime explained Drucker\'s theory.  The ED was soothing albeit a little forgettable.  The OP is similar in style, but by the end of the anime, it will really grow on you.Character(8): The main character has a sense of depth as of the 5th episode.  We don\'t really get too close to any other character, but the anime does a good job of characterizing all more important characters, and they are all likable enough.  It reminds me of Ookiku Furikabutte in a way, although it definitely does not have as much focus on the actual mechanics of the game.Enjoyment(7): I liked this anime to be honest.  It is a breath of fresh air to action oriented or gag/comedy anime.*Edit* I\'ve finished this anime since I wrote this review, and I have to say the latter episodes have been much better.  The slow buildup in the introductory is paying off.  We see the fruits of the team\'s efforts as they dukes it out in the summer tournament.  In the end though I think this anime sends out a message that Drucker\'s business philosophy isn\'t complete by itself.  We are human beings and the memories we make during our lives are just as important as the results we see.This anime was quite enjoyable to me.  If you didn\'t mind the meticulous pacing in Cross game and a focus on plot and the characters, chances are you\'ll also enjoy this anime. there is little if any romance in Moshidora.

Moshidora is not about baseball. It is not about the thrill of winning.What Moshidora offers us is a likable female lead and sage advices on how to be a leader. You will find that the advices given apply to us as well as to managers and world leaders: leading with integrity, what...does it mean to innovate, what is an effective communication, what is a failure, focusing on the results but not the effort, and marketing not just what you want to sell, but also what people want. I heard that this anime is intended for those in their 30s and 40s. If true, then those of us who fall into this age group are no doubt facing these issues daily.Let\'s get to the plot: This is a straightforward affair. Minami Kawashima, the female lead, becomes the manager of a mediocre baseball team. Having no managerial experience and is aversive to baseball, she accidentally picks up Drucker\'s Management, thus embarking on a journey to self-discovery while unleashing her hidden potential as a manager. The first 8 episodes offers numerous quotes from Drucker that I have mentioned are highly relevant to those of us who are now in the ""real world."" The final two episodes contain more drama and if you stick with the series to the end, you will be rewarded with an emotional (or melodramatic) ending.You might now wonder if this series is as bland as I presented. The answer is yes. But you have an endearing female lead who does not fit the stereotypes of your typical female leads in teenage anime series. Minami is not a tsundere or a smart female but for some reason is fallen madly in love over some clueless guy and is fighting for his attention. Minami is compassionate and kind, but she never lets emotion influencing her judgments. She has a razor sharp eye for talents and is not afraid to cut you if you suck. She is results-oriented; excuses like ""but I tried very hard"" will not work on her. Traits that mark a highly capable manager.A word of criticism: The art is far below what one might expect from Production I.G.In summary, you can get a lot of mileage out of this series if you approach this not as a baseball drama, but as a short crash course on what you should do in life. You don\'t have to be a manager or a leader to use the advices and lessons offered in this series. does it mean to innovate, what is an effective communication, what is a failure, focusing on the results but not the effort, and marketing not just what you want to sell, but also what people want.

The episodes...follow Minomi as she incorporates lessons from the management bible to running a baseball team, with interesting results. All the while she is reporting back to, getting advice from, and at times at odds with the team\'s original manager, her friend who is in a hospital with a mystery ailment.Okay so it\'s not the most original story. It does however treat Minomi with respect, she\'s highlighted for her intelligence, resolve and sincerity - nary a shot or scene seems to treat her like a mindless little thing just there to be cute. The baseball is quite realistic, which for me was refreshing. The only foible was that I seriously doubt the team\'s central strategy would be a good idea at all (it ain\'t Moneyball that\'s for sure) but who knows, maybe it would kill in Japanese high school baseball.The end result was just a well-executed sports anime with a refreshing balance between on-field action and character development. It\'s not that it was the most moving story or deepest characters I\'ve ever seen, but it was just good fun to watch. follow Minomi as she incorporates lessons from the management bible to running a baseball team, with interesting results.

Yet, after the slow start this show finally made a connection with me right before it finished. It also made the list of very few shows to have made me cry. Actually the concept of the story is rather original - what happens if your manager read Drucker's book on management?Despite Minami's dislike for baseball she decides to become the team's manager until her hospitalized friend gets discharged. Unfortunately the story is rather average starting after she buys the book, but the execution is done rather well and it is still rather enjoyable. Our horrible team...is essentially on a losing streak and out of shape so our heroine comes to the rescue to bring them to Koushien the goal of every single baseball anime out there.Of course you all pumped to see how applying a business book onto baseball will work out. However, you realize that in the end it can't be anything over the top and it isn't - A new strategy, a new training menu, or motivating the team. It is still cool in a way, but it is an 'oh' moment when in the end it seems as if the book wasn't needed to come up with these things.There are a few games that are shown, and while I usually stay away from sports in real life and in anime I found them rather fun to watch. It does a good job of making things rather suspenseful and occasionally funny. Sometimes the episode focuses on a specific team member, and generally this works out well with their condition on the way to being fixed.It takes a while to get to know all of the cast, at least around episode 6. This is where things start to turn around and the drama begins. It isn't very hard to figure out what will happen, and at first I didn't really show any empathy for the situation. As I mentioned before however, they executed the following time of the show so that by the end I couldn't help but shed a few tears.Moshidora was a relatively short watch that fully captures the story it is showing. The ending is pretty satisfying which is nice to see in an anime for once although is does suffer from a rather dull start. In the end I am glad I stuck with Moshidora and didn't drop it, but it definitely wasn't anything above a Fair/Fine.Questions and feedback on my reviews are welcome and very much appreciated! is essentially on a losing streak and out of shape so our heroine comes to the rescue to bring them to Koushien the goal of every single baseball anime out there.Of course you all pumped to see how applying a business book onto baseball will work out.

This is where things start to turn around and the drama begins. It isn't very hard to figure out what will happen, and at first I didn't really show any empathy for the situation. As I mentioned before however, they executed the following time of the show so that by the end I couldn't help but shed a few tears.Moshidora was a relatively short watch that fully captures the story it is showing. The ending is pretty satisfying which is nice to see in an anime for once although is does suffer from a rather dull start. In the end I am glad I stuck with Moshidora and didn't drop it, but it definitely wasn't anything above a Fair/Fine.Questions and feedback on my reviews are welcome and very much appreciated!"", ""First thing I have to say, in Japan, this anime is adapted by a book I read. I just love it. So I decided to watch the anime and I wasn't disapointed.At first you can think it's a boring anime just about baseball (it's not like I don't like baseball) with a girl who'll do the management of this club. But this anime is more than that. The characters a very good and you can watch the changement in the characters. It's more a anime about the Characters than the baseball. I love the ending song, Daisuki dayo which I think was very good...for the final. The final was really good. But I'll recommend you this anime which is just wondeful. I was really touched by the anime even if I had known the plot.And there is so much anime I was so touched. It's not a tragedic drama but it's so perfect like this.Watch this anime is the only things I have to say you. for the final. The final was really good.

You can’t have one thing without the other and that is also why the music was such a powerful aspect in this series. Though I have to say I liked Yuki’s character design the most out of the rest.MusicI can easily say that Moshidora had great soundtracks playing in the background for whatever the mood. Though it’ll never beat Maeda’s work it really fitted in well for a baseball series....As the OP is sung by the lovely Asuza, her soothing voice lifts you up into a fantasy and might I say that ED accompanied by those screenshots were all so powerful emotionally. A job well done Producton I.GStoryThe story itself started off at a low note and this caused a few to drop Moshidora but you can’t really conclude how good the story is in a few episodes. As I saw it, episode 1 to 5 consisted of character development while episode 6 to 10 consisted of serious baseball and many, many powerful emotions. I really enjoyed it and I can’t find anything to hate about it yet a story can only be great with a good flow and Moshidora had a great flow.The flow in Moshidora appealed to me the most, especially when accompanied by the music and story together. Ever since episode 1, it’s been ascending ever since but once it reached episode 6, it sky rocketed so high that even I didn’t expect such a result! It wouldn’t top TTGL but it was still great. The lead up from getting to know about everyone gives you a sense of understanding. I couldn’t really ask for more from a baseball series.OverallI really want to give this show a 9 out of 10 but staying as un-bias as I can be. I truly think Moshidora deserves an 8 out of 10 at least. As the art wasn’t as special, once the flow of events started to play out with a magnificent soundtrack in the background, you can’t help but reveal that deep emotion that’s welling up inside of you. A great flow, a great story (especially considering it was only 10 episodes long!) and a magnificent execution of music.As for recommendations, I highly recommend Moshidora to those who seek powerful emotions, great character development, magnificent music which will sway your heart and an outstanding flow of events from start to finish.

Drucker's management book proved to be quite effective in helping with Minami's managing of the team as she was able to implement business strategies that helped restore morale to the team and improve their skills as they were originally in shambles before her arrival. For a 10 episode series, Moshidora does do a decent job in its pacing with showing the slow improvements in the quality of the teamwork, coaching and playing coming from the...high school team thanks to Minami's advice from Drucker's management book. It also devotes some time in focusing on some issues faced by individual members of the team, whether the players or the coaching staff, over how they desire to help improve the team and the weaknesses they carry.However, the show is plagued with a couple major issues that keep me from wanting to rank it higher. First would have to be the cheese factor from the show's more serious moments. Moshidora is mostly pretty grounded with its mood in seeing the improvements of the baseball team. However when a more serious moment from any of the team comes up such as Sakurai ditching practices or a shocking event from a prominent character in the second-to-last episode, the series has a bad habit of overly emoting on said moments and the cheese is especially prominent in the final two episodes of the show. Another issue with the show is that the show suffers the stigma of being a sports-themed anime which aren't too receptive with many Western anime fans. The show focused enough on the improvements of the team and if you anticipate the outcome of the baseball games, then you can see what will be happening from a mile away and it prevents you from having any attachment to the successes brought about by the team.Visually, Moshidora does sport scenery and character designs that have a decent amount of detail and bright colors, though it seemed apparent that the show was on a tight animation budget as there were quite a good number of still frame shots one could see at points throughout the series.Moshidora's premise was quite original with its implementation of business management with coaching a baseball team and it was well paced enough to see the improvements of the team and get enough sense of what some of the individual players desired from being involved with the team.

The animation is mediocre and the music completely forgettable; the OP and ED are nice, but that's about it.I did appreciate how they brought in good examples for Drucker's stuff (I was afraid the first two episodes would be representative), which was a definite strong point. I was angry when I realized the twist people had...talked of was the lame trope of the sick-girl getting worse, but mollified when she actually *died* and they didn't pull the EPIC LAME stunt of having her get better after the victorious game. Then they used her death well and tied it all together! This shouldn't be impressive - an honest end which plays straight? - but it is. Overall, while I feel like this is a 7.5, I had to round it to 8 - I didn't expect to like a baseball anime at all, much less one with a business theme. So, well done _Moshidora_, well done. talked of was the lame trope of the sick-girl getting worse, but mollified when she actually *died* and they didn't pull the EPIC LAME stunt of having her get better after the victorious game.

Also, after working on starting a business, I found management to be less than enjoyable.  So, why did I enjoy this anime?  It was mainly because of their desire to revolutionize.

And then, you work your best to carry out your goals.Story: The plot is very basic; girl mistakes a business management book, Druckers, for a baseball management book, then she uses Druckers to manage...the baseball team to go to nationals.

Mushikaburi-hime,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50923/Mushikaburi-hime,"['Mushikaburi-Hime is a must watch for any shoujo/josei fan, because for one, we don’t get enough of these shows, and for two, this is a really cute watch with a couple that will quickly become one of your favourites.Mushikaburi-Hime, like most other shoujo/josei is a character driven slow-burn in which your entertainment depends on how much you like the couple. Fortunately, Chris and Eli have one of the cutest relationships I’ve seen in a while. Premise is straightforward and honestly there’s not much story to speak of. It’s very slice of life based and through their daily struggles Chris and Eli get closer and develop...a stronger bond. I personally enjoyed seeing their love blossom, but also the personal growth that Eli goes through. Going from a shy bookworm who could not express herself, to being a fitting future queen was a really cool journey and it was organically done with incremental steps over the season.The show is of course pretty cliché and plays into many of those 90s style shoujo tropes with a beautiful princess being courted by all these different guys and a main guy who fawns over the MC, etc. And that would probably be one of my biggest complaints. While I loved Eli and Chris’ relationship, I felt the male MC did not really have any growth. If anything, he regresses from a cool noble prince to a simp who can only fawn over Eli. This is cute for a couple episodes, but over a 12 episode run time... it can get kind of old. I would have liked to see him get more development and come into his own as a character more. Obviously with it being a female demographic, that probably was not the intention of the author and I still enjoyed the show without it, but it holds it back from being higher rated IMO. I’d point to Fruits Basket as a gold standard of how that should be done.As with most Josei and most Madhouse projects, art is amazing. Has a really unique look to it and while it doesn’t 100 percent recreate the light novel art, it stays true enough to it.While it’s not the best Josei this year, or even this season, Mushikaburi-Hime is still a must watch for any fan of the romance genre and shoujo/josei fans in general. Our selections are just so slim we don’t have much opportunity to be picky. The plot may not be the strongest, but it is still a very cute story with a loveable MC that you can’t help but want to protect, and a fairy tale type feel.Mushikaburi-Hime gets 8 out of 10. a stronger bond.

I’m all for more shoujo anime being out in the anime world, but this was not the best showing of what the shoujo genre can offer. It’s just a simple story in a royalty setting, where someone who doesn’t really belong tries to fit in, and people get jealous because she’s the prince’s fiancée. It’s quite the bland story with a very straight forward romance, and boring politics that I couldn’t bring myself to care about.STORY:In a nutshell, Elianna Bernstein, a noble from the Sauslind family, which was not the most renowned family out there, is...invited by the Crown Prince, Christopher Selkirk Asherald, to become his fiancée, in exchange for being able to enter the royal archives filled with books to satisfy her craving to read, as she’s a bookworm. Elianna believes the relationship is just one devoid of real love, but just convenience, so she constantly thinks that she’s no match for Christopher, and that she’s a burden to him.This sentiment from Elianna lingers for most of the series, and eventually, she does try to prove that she is worthy of the prince’s hand in marriage, but these doubts in her mind constantly hold both her, and the show back, because it just dances around this theme, and is quite slow in developing effectively.ART:It looks fine, though the movement is quite limited. I would have expected a bit more from Madhouse, but they haven’t been nearly as good of a studio for quite a while now.MUSIC:Not very noticeable, the OP and ED are quite generic and average, and so is the soundtrack.CHARACTERS:By far, Elianna does have the best development out of all the characters, but it’s still quite slow. She learns over time that her words matter, and that her knowledge due to reading books can be put to good use to help others. She’s sadly quite gullible while being smart, and I suppose that’s due to her limited interactions with others since she spends a lot of her time reading. She’s so much a bookworm, she’d probably care more about books than Prince Christopher.Most of the other cast members, including Christopher, just didn’t really do anything for me. Most of them support Elianna well, and for Christopher, there are some good romantic moments, but he didn’t do anything too memorable.ENJOYMENT:I never really liked it, or hated it, it was just consistently average all the way through.THEMATIC EXECUTION:If anything, the romance was executed decently, but not very memorably. The political themes were not really intriguing at all, and I struggled to care about them. Some of the normal royalty tropes were there, with the drama, but they were only decent at the start.OVERALL:There wasn’t much to take away from this, other than the aesthetic being quite decent. There could have been more done around the dramatic aspects of this show, and it felt more slice of life than anything else. It’s not bad by any means, just very average and bland for me personally. invited by the Crown Prince, Christopher Selkirk Asherald, to become his fiancée, in exchange for being able to enter the royal archives filled with books to satisfy her craving to read, as she’s a bookworm.

Whenever I see something that seems like it appeals to my tastes, I actually try to keep an open mind about it. Similarly, there are certain shows and genres that I avoid like the plague. Don\'t expect me to talk about any ecchi anime ever and don\'t expect me to watch shows such as Haruhi Suzumiya, Redo of Healer, or Ranma 1/2 or anything of the like. If you like those shows, cool, good for you. So when I first heard about Bibliophile Princess and...its upcoming anime adaptation, I thought it seemed cute, so I decided to try it out. Since the light novels are only available digitally, I can\'t really rent them, and I don\'t want to buy something and then find that I don\'t like it and be unable to return it, y\'know? I thought, ""Hey! Maybe Bibliophile Princess might be good! I\'ll give it a watch and see for myself!"" Boy howdy do I regret that decision so, so, sooooo much. Dear lord, I wanted to like this show so badly. I really did. But seriously, watching Bibliophile Princess was like being made to go through a muddy river with the promise of a prize at the end, only to find out too late that there was never a prize to begin with. By God, not only is Bibliophile Princess one of the most utterly generic, mediocre, frustrating anime I\'ve ever seen, based on what little I\'ve read of the light novels, it completely fails as an overall adaptation.In the kingdom of Sauslind, Lady Elianna Bernstein and her family of self-professed bookworms live in relative peace, with no desire for power and content with spending their days doing nothing but reading and acquiring knowledge. During Elianna\'s debutante season at court, she is proposed to by the dashing Prince Christopher, the heir to the kingdom. At first, Elianna balks at the idea of being married to him, as she feels there are better candidates out there, but Christopher makes an offer she can\'t bring herself to refuse: If she marries him, she\'ll have special access to the fabled royal archives, a repository of rare tomes, and her social duties will be intentionally limited. Unable to resist the allure of reading new books, Elianna accepts and becomes Christopher\'s fiance, but she does wonder why he of all people would rather marry her and make her his bride when there are other, far better suitable people that want it more?Man, I honestly thought Prima Doll was going to be the worst anime I saw this year, but Bibliophile Princess took the throne by virtue of the fact that everything about it just screams ""I don\'t give a shit."" Seriously, there\'s barely anything redeemable about Bibliophile Princess as an anime. Everything it does has been done way better in other shows, some of which I\'ll mention further down. Bibliophile Princess at best is a boring cliche-fest that has zero ambition. Now, cliches in and of themselves aren\'t inherently bad, and I abide by the philosophy that as long as you flesh out the characters well and care about the story you want to tell, you can make anything good whether it\'s cliche or not, as there\'s no such thing as a truly original story anymore. But everything about Bibliophile Princess just feels extremely passionless, listless, and workman-like, like the staff on the show only produced this because they were mandated to do so to fill out a light novel adaptation quota. From the obnoxiously bright, washed out, and shadowless animation to the similarly mediocre and generic soundtrack, the whole production feels like a poor man\'s Ascendance of a Bookworm. Speaking of Bookworm, does anybody else think that the only reason Yuka Iguchi was brought on to sing the opening was because the producers for this wanted to cash in on Bookworm\'s fame and popularity? Ironically, the opening song is actually the best thing about this show.Beyond that, the writing is just outright stupid. This is the kind of show that was written by people who think that its target audience has the mental capacity of a lobotomized squirrel. Characters act solely on what’s convenient to the plot and make the most bizarre leaps in logic at times. Any attempts this show makes to try and be genuine is overshadowed by their complete stupidity. Add that to a story that is just chockful of plot devices and inconsequential politicial babble that we never even see portrayed on screen, and you basically have a bland mess. Even the character designs have no passion put into them, as the men are all just generic bishounen that are carbon copies of each other save for Alan (Who, ironically, is the only character in this show I liked even though his whole running gag is that nobody remembers him at all), and all the women have similar faces that you wouldn\'t be able to tell apart even if you swapped their hair styles and costumes. The show\'s attempts at political intrigue fall flat because a lot of it just consists of catty girls trying to sabotage Elianna with absolutely no sense of subtlety whatsoever. Characters telegraph their evil intentions like blaring neon lights. The show thinks its smart when it actually isn\'t.Speaking of Elianna, I hate to say it, but she\'s the absolute worst aspect of this show. Bibliophile Princess is constantly beating into our heads that Elianna is this super awesome lady who does great things for her kingdom and others, even showing other characters praising her for her feats...but the thing is, the anime doesn\'t actually show her doing anything of note on screen, so any praise she winds up getting feels not only unearned, but completely undeserved. For example, episode 2, which I feel encapsulates every single flaw this show has, has Elianna be caught up in some girl\'s bad attempt at trying to usurp her as Christopher\'s fiance, and the nobles all wax poetic about all the wonderful things Elianna has done for them. What does Elianna actually do throughout the entire episode? Nothing! She literally just stands at the top of the stairs like a deer in the headlights, making absolutely no attempt to refute any of the mean girl\'s accusations when she has all the power to do so, and everyone else just does everything for her. And she spends THE ENTIRE FUCKING EPISODE JUST STANDING AROUND!!! The fact that everyone worships the ground Elianna walks on even when the anime makes no effort to show her actually doing anything of note on screen just makes Elianna come off as a blatant Mary Sue straight out of someone\'s bad fan fiction, and I\'ve both read and written my fair share of bad fan fiction (My fics were a lot worse as a kid, and I can say I\'ve vastly improved my writing since then)! Furthermore, Elianna\'s personality doesn\'t change all that much and her views are never challenged. There\'s one arc where a military guy points out a lot of the flaws in Elianna\'s proposal about storing food and putting less money into war weapons, and the guy actually makes some fairly reasonable points considering Elianna has literally no experience with military affairs and is a bit too idealistic about preventing war, but after she makes some overly cheesy speech, the guy just laughs it off and accepts Elianna without a second thought! Plus, Elianna never makes the effort to actually talk to people about any issues she has, especially when it matters (Again, episode 2 is the worst example of this), and any time she tries, somebody else steps in and does everything for her, or claim that she did nothing wrong when a lot of conflict could have been avoided if she had just talked to SOMEBODY AT ALL. All throughout the series, Elianna just comes across as a whiny, listless, passionless waif who only cares about books and nothing else, yet is constantly shilled by the entire narrative as this amazing person when she\'s done literally nothing to deserve any praise at all and is given little to no agency or autonomy. The one time she does try to do something (During the Star of Sissel arc) also falls flat because she recklessly throws herself into a situation where a nobleman could easily kill her right then and there, and she didn\'t bother to bring her guard with her. Gee, it\'s almost like trying to confront a powerful nobleman without any weapons or self-defense training is a bad idea!And the thing is, Elianna does have established reasons for being the way she is in the light novels! The LNs establish that she mostly stayed away from social gatherings because she was picked on by aristocratic girls for her love of books and her plain looks, which the anime never bothers to establish in the beginning. Even during the Irene incident, Elianna, while she still stood around and didn\'t do anything, she saw through Irene\'s ploy and even snarked about it in her head, and the LN establishes that the only reason she didn\'t speak up was because she didn\'t know if she was supposed to act or just stay put and follow the mental script everyone was acting out. So basically, the anime deliberately left out what little personality Elianna had in the LNs in favor of making her into a swooning, spineless waif who jumps to conclusions at the slightest thing and barely does anything of her own initiative, even when she has all the power and freedom to do so. Any reasons she has for being the way she is are left out, so it\'s really hard to feel any sympathy for anime Elianna because she basically brought a lot of her own issues on herself and doesn\'t even make the effort to solve her own problems! Do you want to know an anime that features a character that actually does shit and has legitimate reasons for being the way she is? Raven of the Inner Palace, which is airing right now! In that anime, Shouxue is shown to be lonely and isolated because not only does her position as the Raven Consort dictate such, if certain people find out what she really is, they will literally kill her, yet Raven of the Inner Palace actually shows Shouxue going out of her way to help people and solve their problems, whether by their own request or because she wants to, so any loyalty she receives from her new friends and acquaintances actually feels earned. Plus, it is possible to write a heroine who starts off listless and dispassionate as long as the reasons for her being such are plausible. For example, I\'m reading the light novel My Happy Marriage right now (Which is getting an anime fairly soon), and in that series, the heroine, Miyo, is quiet and has zero self-esteem because she was abused and mistreated by her family for her entire life, with the series making it clear right off the bat. Her life improves when she\'s made to marry a rich man named Kiyoka, but marriage alone doesn\'t magically resolve all of her trauma and issues, with the series empathizing that Miyo\'s path to healing will be a long one. In that series, Miyo\'s arc is about her regaining her self-worth, agency, and autonomy and allowing herself to become a more self-assured individual now that she interacts with people who genuinely love and care about her. Elianna doesn\'t have that excuse, so her problems, again, come off more like a girl\'s insufferable whining than anything truly genuine.That\'s not even getting into all the other little problems the anime has as well. In one episode, the series just randomly introduces a character named Lilia and expects us to already know that she and Elianna are acquainted without even showing us how they know each other. Like, the hell? I know Arte had this problem with its anime, but Bibliophile Princess is actually worse about it because even though this girl is in the opening, she just disappears after that arc and never shows up again. The LNs establish that Lilia is Elianna\'s cousin on her mother\'s side, and yet again, the anime just chucks her in there without rhyme or reason. Like, why even put this girl in the opening if you\'re only gonna have her be in the series for two or three episodes and then never again?! God, just thinking more about this series makes my head hurt. Overall, if you\'re into shows like Bibliophile Princess, that\'s totally cool, more power to you. If you like it, great! I personally feel the Bibliophile Princess anime is frustrating and terrible, mainly because it commits a cardinal sin that no adaptation should ever do: It made me question if the source material is even that good to begin with. Seriously, there are so many other things out there that manage to tackle their premise and characters better than Bibliophile Princess could ever hope to do, some of which I\'ve named. All in all, Bibliophile Princess is not only a hopelessly blank, generic anime, but also a terrible adaptation. But don\'t just take my word for it. ANN writer Rebecca Silverman did weekly reviews for the series, and since she\'s read the light novels, she also recognizes the adaptation\'s failures in capturing the spirit and essence of the source material, and even other ANN writers don\'t feel the anime is worth much. But ultimately, you should make your own judgment and see for yourself whether you like or dislike Bibliophile Princess, or anything else, really. At the end of the day, my reviews are just my personal opinions on the stuff I read, watch, and play, nothing more and nothing less. its upcoming anime adaptation, I thought it seemed cute, so I decided to try it out. Since the light novels are only available digitally, I can\'t really rent them, and I don\'t want to buy something and then find that I don\'t like it and be unable to return it, y\'know? I thought, ""Hey! Maybe Bibliophile Princess might be good! I\'ll give it a watch and see for myself!"" Boy howdy do I regret that decision so, so, sooooo much. Dear lord, I wanted to like this show so badly. I really did. But seriously, watching Bibliophile Princess was like being made to go through a muddy river with the promise of a prize at the end, only to find out too late that there was never a prize to begin with. By God, not only is Bibliophile Princess one of the most utterly generic, mediocre, frustrating anime I\'ve ever seen, based on what little I\'ve read of the light novels, it completely fails as an overall adaptation.In the kingdom of Sauslind, Lady Elianna Bernstein and her family of self-professed bookworms live in relative peace, with no desire for power and content with spending their days doing nothing but reading and acquiring knowledge. During Elianna\'s debutante season at court, she is proposed to by the dashing Prince Christopher, the heir to the kingdom. At first, Elianna balks at the idea of being married to him, as she feels there are better candidates out there, but Christopher makes an offer she can\'t bring herself to refuse: If she marries him, she\'ll have special access to the fabled royal archives, a repository of rare tomes, and her social duties will be intentionally limited. Unable to resist the allure of reading new books, Elianna accepts and becomes Christopher\'s fiance, but she does wonder why he of all people would rather marry her and make her his bride when there are other, far better suitable people that want it more?Man, I honestly thought Prima Doll was going to be the worst anime I saw this year, but Bibliophile Princess took the throne by virtue of the fact that everything about it just screams ""I don\'t give a shit."" Seriously, there\'s barely anything redeemable about Bibliophile Princess as an anime. Everything it does has been done way better in other shows, some of which I\'ll mention further down. Bibliophile Princess at best is a boring cliche-fest that has zero ambition. Now, cliches in and of themselves aren\'t inherently bad, and I abide by the philosophy that as long as you flesh out the characters well and care about the story you want to tell, you can make anything good whether it\'s cliche or not, as there\'s no such thing as a truly original story anymore. But everything about Bibliophile Princess just feels extremely passionless, listless, and workman-like, like the staff on the show only produced this because they were mandated to do so to fill out a light novel adaptation quota. From the obnoxiously bright, washed out, and shadowless animation to the similarly mediocre and generic soundtrack, the whole production feels like a poor man\'s Ascendance of a Bookworm. Speaking of Bookworm, does anybody else think that the only reason Yuka Iguchi was brought on to sing the opening was because the producers for this wanted to cash in on Bookworm\'s fame and popularity? Ironically, the opening song is actually the best thing about this show.Beyond that, the writing is just outright stupid. This is the kind of show that was written by people who think that its target audience has the mental capacity of a lobotomized squirrel. Characters act solely on what’s convenient to the plot and make the most bizarre leaps in logic at times. Any attempts this show makes to try and be genuine is overshadowed by their complete stupidity. Add that to a story that is just chockful of plot devices and inconsequential politicial babble that we never even see portrayed on screen, and you basically have a bland mess. Even the character designs have no passion put into them, as the men are all just generic bishounen that are carbon copies of each other save for Alan (Who, ironically, is the only character in this show I liked even though his whole running gag is that nobody remembers him at all), and all the women have similar faces that you wouldn\'t be able to tell apart even if you swapped their hair styles and costumes. The show\'s attempts at political intrigue fall flat because a lot of it just consists of catty girls trying to sabotage Elianna with absolutely no sense of subtlety whatsoever. Characters telegraph their evil intentions like blaring neon lights. The show thinks its smart when it actually isn\'t.Speaking of Elianna, I hate to say it, but she\'s the absolute worst aspect of this show. Bibliophile Princess is constantly beating into our heads that Elianna is this super awesome lady who does great things for her kingdom and others, even showing other characters praising her for her feats...but the thing is, the anime doesn\'t actually show her doing anything of note on screen, so any praise she winds up getting feels not only unearned, but completely undeserved. For example, episode 2, which I feel encapsulates every single flaw this show has, has Elianna be caught up in some girl\'s bad attempt at trying to usurp her as Christopher\'s fiance, and the nobles all wax poetic about all the wonderful things Elianna has done for them. What does Elianna actually do throughout the entire episode? Nothing! She literally just stands at the top of the stairs like a deer in the headlights, making absolutely no attempt to refute any of the mean girl\'s accusations when she has all the power to do so, and everyone else just does everything for her. And she spends THE ENTIRE FUCKING EPISODE JUST STANDING AROUND!!! The fact that everyone worships the ground Elianna walks on even when the anime makes no effort to show her actually doing anything of note on screen just makes Elianna come off as a blatant Mary Sue straight out of someone\'s bad fan fiction, and I\'ve both read and written my fair share of bad fan fiction (My fics were a lot worse as a kid, and I can say I\'ve vastly improved my writing since then)! Furthermore, Elianna\'s personality doesn\'t change all that much and her views are never challenged. There\'s one arc where a military guy points out a lot of the flaws in Elianna\'s proposal about storing food and putting less money into war weapons, and the guy actually makes some fairly reasonable points considering Elianna has literally no experience with military affairs and is a bit too idealistic about preventing war, but after she makes some overly cheesy speech, the guy just laughs it off and accepts Elianna without a second thought! Plus, Elianna never makes the effort to actually talk to people about any issues she has, especially when it matters (Again, episode 2 is the worst example of this), and any time she tries, somebody else steps in and does everything for her, or claim that she did nothing wrong when a lot of conflict could have been avoided if she had just talked to SOMEBODY AT ALL. All throughout the series, Elianna just comes across as a whiny, listless, passionless waif who only cares about books and nothing else, yet is constantly shilled by the entire narrative as this amazing person when she\'s done literally nothing to deserve any praise at all and is given little to no agency or autonomy. The one time she does try to do something (During the Star of Sissel arc) also falls flat because she recklessly throws herself into a situation where a nobleman could easily kill her right then and there, and she didn\'t bother to bring her guard with her. Gee, it\'s almost like trying to confront a powerful nobleman without any weapons or self-defense training is a bad idea!And the thing is, Elianna does have established reasons for being the way she is in the light novels! The LNs establish that she mostly stayed away from social gatherings because she was picked on by aristocratic girls for her love of books and her plain looks, which the anime never bothers to establish in the beginning. Even during the Irene incident, Elianna, while she still stood around and didn\'t do anything, she saw through Irene\'s ploy and even snarked about it in her head, and the LN establishes that the only reason she didn\'t speak up was because she didn\'t know if she was supposed to act or just stay put and follow the mental script everyone was acting out. So basically, the anime deliberately left out what little personality Elianna had in the LNs in favor of making her into a swooning, spineless waif who jumps to conclusions at the slightest thing and barely does anything of her own initiative, even when she has all the power and freedom to do so. Any reasons she has for being the way she is are left out, so it\'s really hard to feel any sympathy for anime Elianna because she basically brought a lot of her own issues on herself and doesn\'t even make the effort to solve her own problems!

It does not over do things to make it bland and does a good job to keep you hooked at least for the first...4 episodes.The characters are well-written but some are pretty predictable at best. The first 2 episodes introduced a female antagonist that we can say is your standard Shoujo Anime antagonist. How strong is that second episode?

So if you enjoy shows that will make you feel terrible being single - you should at least give this a try.

Yay! Her love for books means basically nothing by the way. It’s pretty much a gimmick to show she isn’t a piece of cardboard. Unfortunately, possibly the most boring gimmick imaginable was used so it doesn’t work. These characters are so bland it’s ridiculous.Almost every episode goes one of two ways. First, some girls are jealous of Elianna and try to take her place while being gross toward her, and this somehow makes Elianna question whether her obviously obsessed boyfriend actually...likes her, only for him to save the day. Second is there’s a villain doing evil things. Of course, there’s book damage involved because there has to be a reason for Elianna’s existence. And then her boyfriend saves the day, either directly or indirectly. The plot is truly obnoxious.Nothing’s ever developed in this anime. Elianna’s wrongly accused of something? Let’s spend half the episode on flashbacks that never happened on screen during the same scene! Someone’s mad at Elianna?

(Also I think the second half of the show is building up to some larger conspiracy but I just cannot bring myself to be bothered anymore...)You would think a show like this would at least make the characters interesting to make up for the lack of plot, but you\'d be wrong. Eliana feels like a 13-year-old wattpad writer\'s Mary Sue self insert. I wouldn\'t be so mad at the whole smart yet gullible sheltered princess archetype if this damn show was self-aware enough to make her face some sort of consequence for her naïvety, but no: everytime she messes up she\'s got some pawn there to save the day for her. Hence, her default is passive, polite and inoffensive except if someone dares to even look at a book the wrong way - then the little wallflower suddenly goes badass mode like straight out of a 2011 ""don\'t fck with me, you wouldn\'t want me to unleash my dark side"" tumblr post. And it\'s not epic or cool. It\'s embarassing.Prince Chris has a few decent moments of characterization here and there but really, everybody else barely matters because dialogue that could have been used to establish the personalities of a nice little supporting cast is instead spent explaining historical backgrounds and politics that noone watching this for the romance actually gives a shit about.One of the saving graces of this show seems to be that it\'s pretty - at first glance... While the character designs might not be the most original, I do still find them pleasing to look at, especially the many lovingly designed dresses worn by the main character. However, the problem here is that they\'re obviously made for pictures in a light novel rather than fluid animation. So by the time episode 4 rolls around, movements have become stiff, proportions have gotten wonky, shot composition and camera angles are now boring and even the few action scenes are disorientating and almost impossible to follow. It is also around the same time that the show completely abandons the rule of ""show don\'t tell"", so if unlike me you\'re actually a fan of creative depictions of fantasy politics, forget about it. It\'s literally just pictures of two people talking with some lip flabs on top of it.The audio of this show too is all in all forgettable; the opening is cute but nothing special, I have never once bothered to listen to the ending all the way through and I can\'t remember any track on the OST sticking out to me either. The voice actors\' emotional range is extremely limited by the fact that firstly, 99% of the dialogue is dull exposition dumping and secondly, they are for the most part constricted to this frustratingly calm and polite court language that allows for almost no real feelings.

Determined. Intelligence. Subtle. Passive. (Unconventionally) Strong Female lead. Slice of Life. PoliticalI wasn\'t really expecting anything when I first started to watch this anime. I walked in with no context nothing. If I had read the description. Where to start?The main female character doesn\'t have major super powers but her character development was subtle, gentle and slow. I will admit that there are flaws in her but that\'s what, to me, made her more loveable. She starts as a character with one sole...focus and purpose, but as she\'s ushered into a new world faced with different challenges she learns how to branch out of her one dimensional character. There was a significant moment where she was in the wrong, she knew she was in the wrong, she knew that she had hurt someones feelings. This misunderstanding caused a lot of trouble for herself, but she was able to acknowledge it and move forward and do what was needed to fix it.Issues I have with her, is that she is naive and comes off easy to push around, and that character flaw never goes away... However she starts speaking for herself and she starts explaining her thought patterns behind why things should be the way that they are. This is not a Female lead that will spark a heated argument, nor is she a character that will fight in the front lines. She does what she does best, which is be herself. There was something else in this anime that I really liked and that was that there is an idea of perfection that we seem to have, ""It\'s okay to strive for perfection as long as that is not the only thing you strive for."" There was a sense of you don\'t need to rely on yourself and what you are bad at, others are good at. This isn\'t something that you pick up straight away, in fact it wouldn\'t be something that you\'d think about unless you are writing a review or talking to someone about it.The cute romance part captured my attention, this guy is determined to have Eli and he fights for that right... Not physically. But it was nice to see a Male lead that didn\'t really have a gaggle of girls around him. This would, I think, classify as a political anime too. Maybe not in the same way as others but I think that this is a hidden gem and maybe a little niche.There is so much to say about this but I don\'t want to give it away. I understand what everyone else says is there own personal opinion, but I thought I would throw my 3 cents in. focus and purpose, but as she\'s ushered into a new world faced with different challenges she learns how to branch out of her one dimensional character.

There was no substance worth making the plot exciting or interesting it really felt like a “women are dumb and men do all the work” kind of stereotype. Eliana does absolutely as the FL and when it comes to her relationship she is a doormat. It was really annoying how many times she would tell herself she needed to speak up about her feelings and then run away when the perfect moments would come around. The males literally do all the work including in the relationship which is wrong and...inaccurate and for this anime to have only been released in 2022 it’s like a regression in feminism. It was not even relatable to, situation wise. Eliana’s doorknob personality really pissed me off. She has such a supportive family that her personality literally makes zero sense. She has insecurities that the Prince always saves her from bad situations but, she doesn’t speak up in the first place. The Prince is basically forced to save her from her insecurities without knowing what she’s actually worrying about.

It’s irritating.', ""The Saint's Magic Power is Being a Bookworm.From the title I just conjured up in my mind you might think that I’m implying Bibliophile Princess is a sort of cross between The Saint’s Magic Power is Omnipotent and Ascendance of a Bookworm, but in reality it has very little in common with those two shows. For one, Bibliophile Princess is not an isekai with overpowered, magical, cardboard protagonists thank christ (not to say The Saint’s Magic Power is Omnipotent and Ascendance of a Bookworm are bad because they’re isekai, in fact they’re both rather good.), but a period, regency romance about a young, socially awkward...noble lady called Elianna who loves nothing more than to read books, and a dashing prince called Christopher who bribes her with access to the royal library in exchange for her posing as his finance so he can keep all the greedy and annoying suiters being forced onto him off his back.It’s a cute show stylised akin to a shojo romance manga thanks to Madhouses use a light colour pallet and shaders that thoroughly explores Elianna’s struggles and the anxiety that comes with the role of being the future queen, and how she deals with an onslaught of women and powerful families behind the scenes that want her out of the picture. However, the show itself restricted by the light novel story arc structure that it’s adapting. There are long stretches of episodes which feel like they go on and on -maybe because the director didn’t know how to adapted them from book to the screen- which results in a lot of tell-don’t-show instead of the other way around. This is unfortunately a persistent problem throughout the season.A good example of this is the way Elianna’s achievements are not really shown to us, but rather told to the audience via the prince or someone else close to her boasting to the villain of the episode about what she’s done and how valuable her contributions are. What makes this boasting sillier is that Elianna achieved these feats by reading books and studying topics such as fallen/prosperous kingdoms, medicines or and other cultures, and putting the lessons and knowledge they provide into practice for the betterment of the kingdom and it’s people. The thing is though… any noble can do that(?), but it’s treated like a freak occurrence which begs the question, how is the kingdom still standing? Either the nobles can’t read or they’re just incompetent in my opinion.I actually really enjoyed Elianna’s and Christopher’s relationship. They’re very sweet together, and although it’s slightly repetitive I think the struggles and pressures they both go through to balance their romance whilst acting in their respective roles is well depicted.I can’t say I liked the rest of the cast though. I don’t hate them or anything. Apart from Christopher’s cheeky uncle there weren’t any stand out performances, but the characters who did stand out stood out because they felt like they belonged to different anime genre.Overall Bibliophile Princess is fine. I don’t think it will particularly wow anyone, but if you’re looking for a chill, period, regency romance and drama with underlying themes of what it means to love someone and what it means to be in a position of power… then you could probably do better, but this is a good alternative.6/10 It’s Okay *Thumbs Up* noble lady called Elianna who loves nothing more than to read books, and a dashing prince called Christopher who bribes her with access to the royal library in exchange for her posing as his finance so he can keep all the greedy and annoying suiters being forced onto him off his back.It’s a cute show stylised akin to a shojo romance manga thanks to Madhouses use a light colour pallet and shaders that thoroughly explores Elianna’s struggles and the anxiety that comes with the role of being the future queen, and how she deals with an onslaught of women and powerful families behind the scenes that want her out of the picture.

Urg. Worst female MC I\'ve ever had the displeasure of knowing. During the whole show I was waiting for her to grow and finally start doing things but no. The most she did was aknowledging her faults and then the prince is coming; saying to her ""you\'re good as you are"". No she is not ! She is supposed to be queen not some weak parrot.The confrontations scenes were terrible :""antagonist"" : \'You are *mean thing*\'Eli : repeating, \'*Mean thing* ?\'anta : \'yes you are, + good argument\'eli :     :(this,...or she says something she read in a book or is protected by the prince.Not Recommended if you want an interresting female MC or she says something she read in a book or is protected by the prince.Not Recommended if you want an interresting female MC', 'I thought reverse harem/regular harem ""reincarnated in otome game"" isekai was the most cringe combo ever, but it seems like the regular generic medieval romance shoujo gives it a run for the money.At least in ""reincarnated in a otome game"" type novels or anime, the rest of the cast is kind of bland or NPC-like for a reason. The characters are from a reverse-harem game or something, and thus, they kind of act more wooden and there\'s no reason to go delve deep into the characters. Similar to using the generic ""medieval fantasy"" setting, these types of shows thrive on having the MC be in...a world of familiarity so the world doesn\'t need to be expanded upon, and knowing all of the basic personalities of characters. Thus, the spotlight is on the MC, trying to figure out her situation, and she generally ends up having a strong personality, since her monologuing and actions essentially carry the show.Mushikaburi-hime does the exact opposite of having the most boring and bland MC while also having suffering same problem with generic characters. First of all, Elianna is a character that\'s a contradiction. Clearly, the emphasis on her knowledge and intelligence is highlighted over and over again. She\'s constantly reading books, her family is extremely smart and bookish as well, and she even reads more academic topics, like the history of her empire. Yet, you\'re telling me that a person with such erudite attributes is somehow also an airhead that\'s a doormat? Elianna shows no initiative. She gets thrown into the midst of courtroom politics and is unable to follow up. She doesn\'t really try to get information, and even when given obvious hints that something is brewing, she\'s completely clueless. All of the sudden, she can\'t connect the dots. She lacks the drive or motivation that an otome game reincarnated MC would generally have, but all of the characters are also extremely generic and don\'t have much going for them either. A majority of screen time is spent on Elianna, yet she still possesses very little characterization.What ends up happening? The clueless girl that\'s somehow also an extreme academic that possesses a plethora of knowledge gets saved by her prince. Essentially, she does nothing. She gets plotted by, and in the end, gets saved by external factors. You could say that her contribution to her getting saved is zero. Nilch. A piece of cardboard would have done the same amount of effort to saving their own demise as Elianna did. Is this what shoujo is about? Being at the whim of others and hopefully, your loved interest will save the day?Of course Elianna and the prince both slowly fall in love with each other over the course of four years.

How could you possibly enjoy this show?', ""True to the shoujo genre, the artstyle and overall visuals of this anime are very pretty, dialed up to 11 with the princess's frilly dresses and the endless bishounen characters with tall and slender builds that appeal to many of (Japan's) shoujo fanbase. Of course, being an animated work, the art will never measure up to the manga, and that's fine; I'm usually lenient with artwork not measuring up to still images in anime.For other mostly superficial aspects of the show like sound, it was mostly okay. Nothing about the soundtrack stood out or was particularly grating, bar the constant senpai-you-to-death tier of high...pitched frailness in the main character's voice acting which got annoying after a while.However, when it comes to what counts, this show fails on multiple levels.Yes, I acknowledge that sex appeal sells and so do escape fantasies. However, I believe it is possible to have a bit of this without making a show 90% this and 10% substance.Plotwise, given the interests of the main characters is to get together and be married in a royal setting, if there was any threat to that, the first 2-3 episodes were enough to clear up the misunderstanding about the female lead being a convenient stand-in fiancee. Yes, there is a girl who wants to be princess and Elianna is in the way. Yes, this is typical. I can forgive this tropey setup given the setting if it was just this. Problem is, throughout the show, the conflict is basically just mostly this on some kind of repeat -- some other noblewoman wants to be princess and does things and MC is too helpless to deal with it and just cries until her prince saves her.Characterization-wise, the show tries to sell Elianna's booksmarts as some sort of strength and don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with being knowledgeable. However, this is basically her only redeeming quality as a main character. As a main character, she has nearly no agency, is barely a heroine of her own story, and can be summed up as a Cinderella who had a loving and supportive family with a love of books. Throughout the near-loop tier repetition of plotting noble girls who get in her way, she exhibits nearly no growth of character and remains as frail and helpless from beginning to end. The prince and support cast is no better.To sum this up [aka tldr]:This show is the ultimate escape princess fantasy for women who want to live in a world where they are hot and rich, have a hot and rich and powerful boyfriend who is blindly loyal to them, be loved by literally everyone with any ability to influence their life and all the other good stuff. The only thing missing now is magic powers and sparkling fairy friends.To be clear, there is nothing wrong with liking this show.

However, it was ruined by terrible characterizations and overuse of cliches. It ended up being flat, boring and trashy.Let's start with the characterizations.

Her defining characteristic is loving to read books, which plays little to no role in furthering the plot. Oh, wait it does. Only, it is shown in the most boring and least impactful way. I believe that in order to make character traits more believable, the writer should strive to show, not tell. The writer of this show...chooses the complete opposite of telling the achievements of the protagonist instead of showing it. How disappointing.

There were side characters that had potential of filling screen time that might have not been played out to their full potential.If there was a second season, and a lot less miscommunication drama, I would absolutely watch it.

They did end up talking it out in the end, but it was a tad annoying...that she asked for space and she was surprised when she got it and this guy has only been courteous of her.Her habit of not saying everything on her mind due to feeling as if she\'s going to burden them is one I struggle with, but I can see very much how that would annoy another.

It *sounded* like it’d have all the elements of a nice cozy series about a girl who loves to read. For me, that’s an easy hook. She loves books. I love to books. We have so much in common. Wham! Easily relatable protagonist. But, ultimately, I found myself just as annoyed with this series as the heroine constantly seemed to be. All she wanted was to be left to her books to read. That’s all I wanted for her too! And yet. And...yet… our heroine, a hopeless bookwork, gets continuously distracted by the various episodic problems created by the multitude of other women fighting for the prince’s affection despite the fact that none of them have even the slightest chance with him. He makes this pretty clear, early on, plainly, in front of everyone in the court, but they continue their worthless schemes, struggling away, even though they’ve been utterly defeated by miss bookworm. Every episode I wanted to scream at the screen. “Stop! Just stop! Let the poor girl read!!” I would have watched an entire series with just the main heroine reading her books and reporting to the prince about the various things she learns. They’d flirt over tea (or coffee). It would have made for an adorable shojo romance. Unfortunately what we’re left with is a series that’s basically a ‘monster of the week’ type thing, but the monsters are just other ladies of the court. Sadly, this left me pretty disappointed. The chemistry between the prince and the princess was genuinely good, but we barely got any screen time with them together. I have very mixed feelings about this show.

Elianna's, and Prince Christopher's engagement starts then as purely platonic. The reason that Elianna accepted Christopher's marriage proposal, is only because she is then granted the use of the Royal Palace's archives. Eventually, Elianna begins to form real feelings of love toward Christopher.It's a somewhat vanilla romance anime, and a bit bland. There's no great overarching plot, it's more of a light-hearted, slice-of-life character driven show. Elianna herself is the most interesting character of the...series. She is actually very intellectual and a goodhearted girl.  Also, the chemistry between Elianna and Christopher is sweet, and you want to cheer them both on, especially Elianna.OP and ED songs are nothing memorable or catchy, but they are still fine. Art in the show is very lightly colored and bright, and the characters blend in the backgrounds in indoor scenes. Voice acting and animation is your standard fare, nothing bad, nothing exceptional. Don't know if it's a compliment or not, but it is easily the best romance anime of the 2022 fall season in my opinion.

Such is the genres of focus being cash cows for everyone involved, diving deep into the Shonen and Isekai genres, because let\'s be honest: Japan\'s surplus for works like these haven\'t stopped and will keep on coming like Truck-kun banging just right outside of everyone\'s doors. One such particular demographic that you don\'t see get targeted much is the Shoujo genre, that with shows like the recently completed re-adaptation of Fruits Basket and the currently ongoing Tokyo Mew Mew New, there isn\'t the...time and resource justified to make new Shoujo anime anymore to appease the minority.But still, when people try, we at least get something that stands out from the rest of the typical copy-paste blurb that we\'ve seen of both the Shonen and Isekai genres, and that\'s how we get novelist Yui\'s Mushikaburi-hime a.k.a Bibilophile Princess. And this also being another Syosetu title, it\'s definitely surprising to find a fair few stories that isn\'t the Isekai Reincarnation kind.As is with Shoujo anime, think of it as like the past glories of Kaichou wa Maid-sama! and the closest example being that of Ouran Koukou Host Club a.k.a Ouran High School Host Club, but with the show\'s premise being pretty much like Akatsuki no Yona a.k.a Yona of the Dawn or Akagami no Shirayuki-hime a.k.a Snow White with the Red Hair, only except that the female MC Elianna Bernstein, is like Honzuki\'s Myne in every regard. This is because Elianna is not just your typical girl: she is known as the Bibilophile Princess, coming from a family of bibilophiles and is a family heirloom of national treasures that benefit the Kingdom as the ""brains of Sauslind"", but choosing to be politically neutral in the sight of conflict. Being a bibilophile and a bookworm herself, after being engaged with Christopher Selkirk Ashelard, the crown prince of the kingdom, Elianna chooses to house herself in Sauslind\'s royal library just for the added perks of being able to access the royal archives and read all day long, which consequently earns the ire of many others in the kingdom\'s walls and labelling her as a phony fiancé: someone who completely ignores the happenings and proceedings, and most importantly, the crown prince Christopher himself to his own devices.To be fair, I think that Christopher and Elianna\'s relationship is just about what you expect from a completely Shoujo work: the crown prince and his princess, there\'s so much uncertainty that\'s riding with the tumultuous commotion of the kingdom and going along with it, the not-yet husband-and-wife duo must act coordinated and soundly to ensure that their kingdom doesn\'t fall in pieces. And that is Elianna\'s Achilles Heel: with her presence almost being equal that of a wandering ghost trying to play catch-up with the kingdom\'s numerous political issues, whilst remaining close to her heart about the way that she would handle things. It\'s that tenacity where she feels like she\'s lost at times, though her comeback will vary since people MUST act like in a complete Shoujo environment of wavering feelings and decisions made that could affect her fiancee as well. And that always turn out to be that hit-and-miss feeling of lackuster aspects about the source material as well. The other characters of servitude, eh I can take or leave it being the fact that there\'s just way too many of them to even give us time to think about. Though I would say that the Ikemen that pretty much stuck with me is the butler character Alan Ferrera, he\'s the perfect embodient of a background character used as a running gag of a joke that to me, truly never gets old.I\'m just going to be frank: what\'s up with Madhouse being chosen to adapt very odd titles, outside of the ones that we expect them to have (i.e. Overlord), not to mention Winter\'s HakoZume a.k.a Police in a Pod (which that one I felt was within the acceptable range). Ironically, in the same vein, they have done shows like Ore Monogatari!! and YoriMoi before, so this should be a cakewalk...and as someone commented in a review, the strange white vignette that\'s used all the time as a filter, yelp. I mean, this is a relatively different Madhouse we\'re looking at now after all of the fiasco that the studio has undergone throughout the years, and is trying to find a groove for itself. Sadly, I don\'t think that this show ever fitted with Madhouse\'s abundance to begin with, but it just looks fine.At least the OST fares somewhat better: DanMachi\'s Yuka Iguchi producing a really nice OP song, and Kashitarou Itou being the falsetto, perfect-pitch tenor guy with a unique vocal voice to boot. Music is generally enjoyable, but in the context of the show as a whole, it\'s not much.I think I know the reason why we gravitiate less towards Shoujo shows: being the predictable premises that they are, it takes talent and creativity to spice all of the melodrama out of a series, and for novelist Yui, it would\'ve been OK for the time had this show came out much earlier, but I digress that there\'s just nothing unique about it, aside from the tried-and-true Shoujo demographic hit points. Let\'s be real: the right for Shoujo anime to exist, is only if the writers and their source material have enough traction to go around, and this show didn\'t even generate any marketing about it other than the usual teaser and PVs to go around.Is it a shame that there\'s no more Shoujo shows left to adapt? It depends honestly, but in the case of Mushikaburi-hime a.k.a Bibilophile Princess, it\'s a dud, a false perception of the Shoujo genre\'s comeback, even if miniscule.

Elianna has such low self-esteem that in the newest episode at the time of writing this review, episode 10, a child is able to make her feel insecure due to her suggesting she goes to an event with her fiancee (the prince) instead of her. She then ended up asking the prince to delay the wedding because of this and not knowing his stance on concubines??? Like so many things would've been simplified if you just talked, this is...like middle school-level drama of refusing to talk things out. I get that she was sheltered because she spent all her time with books or whatever, but the repetition of 'someone saying something / doing something, her misinterpreting it, getting sad, then turns out it was fine all along!' is getting tiring. like middle school-level drama of refusing to talk things out.

Overall, it was unimpressive. In the art style as well as the story of the anime. The first episode isn\'t really clever since the audience is left not knowing what\'s happening. One can be left thinking the first few episodes like ""what the heck is happening around this castle!?."" It\'s boring watching the protagonist walk around only being concerned with books. The attitude of other characters at certain moments never seem to faze her. It makes her come off as self centered. I would think she should at least at one point be concerned with her surroundings, instead she...continues with her books. You would hope for her own sake that she would have a sense of urgency. Her fight or flight seems like it would be completely non-existent. So, this leads to a reveal that feels like the writers have no trust in the audience and like her accomplishments are not genuinely real. Watching this it seemed as if at one point the main guy would be like, ""I just lied to make you look good."" Or like the other nobles are just thinking, ""I just want to get in a good position with his highness so I will say everything he\'s stating is fact and truth."" These episodes weren\'t well executed.Additionally, there\'s a scene where the main love interest just basically said to the lady protagonist ""ha! Now you have to marry me! You have no choice!"" She likes him but she was never allowed to express this before the prince made this decision without her input. It feels similar to blackmail. And that\'s something I don\'t appreciate in shoujo anime that happens too often. He just decides on his own, which doesn\'t come off as loving but possessive. Then the protagonist doesn\'t at least push back against such a major decision for her. It gets tiring seeing female protagonist just be so passive. And this girl just hits the bar high for passiveness. I decided to drop from watching this anime after the first few unexciting episodes and lacking characters. I know the time period of the anime is set in a past but it\'s also honestly not going to copy everything from those periods. It\'s not a work of fact.

So many shows have the love interests kiss once at the end, and this had so much more intimacy than I was expecting, and I was thrilled about it. It did a great job of providing chemistry and tension between Elianna and Christopher. I was super happy with the portrayal of their relationship.It's well worth watching just for that.Sadly, the storyline was less impressive. It wasn't bad by any means, but it could have used more creativity and originality. They use and reuse...certain tactics to attempt to break up the pair, and it definitely was not my favorite. Also, there are a number of unanswered questions, like why can't Elianna remember her childhood with Chris?That said, I didn't watch this show for the plot. I watched it for the romance.

And after the first snob got their comeuppance, it got a little old when it happened again and again where Eli needed her prince to come save her. And im not sneezing at the princess in distress trope, some people really get off on that kind of thing, but a...better story would have the character its happening to learn from it and grow in interesting ways, Eli was just sort of...bland and indifferent to things that happened around her apart from feeling like the victim again. The prince was just a handsome prince thats devoted to his crush on her. he doesnt do too much to stand out as a character or anything. The other side characters are forgettable too, but at least this anime wasnt trying too hard, which in my opinion, is way worse. Like when an anime character HAS to come onto the scene declaring themselves as quirky or important trying to force the watcher to remember them, Shonin have a bad habit of that, where in Shojo its given to be more of a subtle nudge to establish a character and their importance. this show just sort of dums it down so bad I dont really care about any other characters and what they have to say, it took a lot of effort to care about what the mains had to say it was so bland.But im not going to lie and pretend the first few episodes didnt have me excited about watching the next episode, the tea spillage was just too indulgent.

It's not just driving home the changes of Elianna, not just the separation of her and Christopher, nor just her influence on everyone around her, or how people perceive her. It's a much more vast net being cast in what they story wants to tell us, the inclusion of characters like Irvin, Hayden, Sophia, and Anna really serve to widen the perspective of both the viewers and Elianna. Hayden continually chastising Elianna, and only Elianna for her ability because of her interference is a really solid angle, because how...does the Bibliophile Princess know what remains in the hearts and minds of the people when she only pursues what exists within books? It plays out really interesting because his criticism from the episode prior has validity to it, but his continual derision of Elianna's actions clearly lies in another place in regards to the influence she holds over the actions of the crown.Irvin presents sort of a similar, but almost opposite, criticism of Elianna that really shows how far she's come as a character from her beginnings. He's after the Brain of Sauslind, not the Fiance of Christopher, and it really feels like he's making the most of the scheming of Sophia and the commotion that it causes to isolate Elianna and attempt to coerce her into where she originally was. I'm not entirely sure if he'll end up some love interest trope in some way or not, but at this point in time there's definitely nothing that points to it, in comparison to his potentially malicious involvement. It's hard to really guess at which faction had the arrow pierce the boar in that regard because his involvement is so loose comparatively. The arrows in his quiver don't match but it's possible to use a different one for that moment if prepared for it. At the same time though, Sophia's maid could have been the one to orchestrate as they could have used the horse as misdirection for protecting Elianna, and Irvin just chose to swoop in for his own benefit. I'm really interested to see where the mystery leads itself.Speaking of mystery, Theodore and the ghost in this episode was an interesting piece to add that doesn't get directly addressed. The similarity to Elianna, and the isolation and history of her family really paints a curious picture for what may have gone on. I don't have high hopes that it will end up as lofty as Elianna being related to them, but I definitely think Theodore will find some closure or answers to his history with the ghost in the future. Aside from that though, I loved how Theodore brushed off Sophia constantly, it added a much appreciated fun spin to some of the heavy drama involved in the episode. Though, there's quite a few small moments that make great use of levity to give the viewer a break, like the running gag with Alan (who I didn't actually recognize as Alan immediately, I'm sorry Alan!), and things like that.Anna was a really interesting character in this episode, and seeing her interest in Elianna I'm super curious for where she ends up going forward. There's definitely two routes to take, and I think with how the author's handled things so far both will end up interesting and satisfying. Regardless of that though, I swear I know Elianna's quote about kings and women from somewhere but for the life of me I can't find it. Anna and Elianna definitely make a great pair though so I'm hopeful to see them turn into a long term thing within the story. Especially so with how Elianna sees Anna, and how its inferred that Anna sees Elianna. Both admire the other and already seem to get along quite well.Going to the other side of the spectrum though, Christopher gives off a lot of negativity which I think is great to see. There's been cracks in his façade in earlier episodes, but this feels like the first time he takes the mask off. He voices his concerns of overthinking and anxiety, and his frustration to leaving Elianna on her own. He even goes as far as lamenting the fact that he pulled Elianna away from her beloved books so much and put her in danger in the first place. It's really great to see that the prince that has everything under control always is capable of suffering and self-tormenting as well, and really places him perfectly beside the challenges we already know of with Elianna. The pair were already great on the surface considering the slight differences between one another, but they continue to find ways to express the uniqueness of each without alienating the other.I'm definitely curious to see what the plan is that Sophia's maid has cooked up and ready for Elianna in the next episode, and what Irvin's involvement will be. Is he going to attempt to thwart it? Will he out himself as a malicious actor and alter the plan to his benefit? Lots of interesting stuff to go off of for sure, so I'm really looking forward to it! does the Bibliophile Princess know what remains in the hearts and minds of the people when she only pursues what exists within books? It plays out really interesting because his criticism from the episode prior has validity to it, but his continual derision of Elianna's actions clearly lies in another place in regards to the influence she holds over the actions of the crown.Irvin presents sort of a similar, but almost opposite, criticism of Elianna that really shows how far she's come as a character from her beginnings. He's after the Brain of Sauslind, not the Fiance of Christopher, and it really feels like he's making the most of the scheming of Sophia and the commotion that it causes to isolate Elianna and attempt to coerce her into where she originally was. I'm not entirely sure if he'll end up some love interest trope in some way or not, but at this point in time there's definitely nothing that points to it, in comparison to his potentially malicious involvement.

I was looking forward to watching this anime for a while since I've read the novel and it was good and had more mystery which lead me to complete (or shall I say consume) the novel in a few hours while the anime was more focused on the romance aspect. It was more shallow than the novel.Overall rating - 5/10Not the best anime out there but also not the worse. Decent animation, mediocre plot, bad VA for main characters but good on supporting characters.Animation - 7/10Since there's also the opening where mushikaburi-hime...is literally translated as Princess of the Bibliophile while it's supposed to be Bibliophile Princess. Both titles have different meanings after all which plummeted the appeal of the animation for me (imagine seeing 12 eps. with that wrongly translated opening).Story - 5/10Additionally, rather than highlighting Elianna's contributions on the empire and how she proved herself as a valid crown princess candidate through her contributions, the animation focused more on how Elianna proved to be Chris' equal partner.Sound - 3/10Lastly, this might be a personal preference but I didn't expect that Elianna's voice was more shrill rather than mild & feathery (certainly not what I expected for a mild-mannered princess who doesn't speak like annoying female nobles) and Chris' voice was straight up orotund rather than resonant and crisp given that he's the calculating type of prince rather than the raucous type. So to speak, I didn't enjoy the voice acting since they didn't match the main characters. It gave the animation a more shallow meaning rather than the deep meaning behind the succession of events since Chris sounded more preachy and Elianna more fussy. The supporting characters had better VA's especially for Alan & Elianna's Uncle Theodore which were on point with their characters which was the redeeming point here. is literally translated as Princess of the Bibliophile while it's supposed to be Bibliophile Princess.

This show is for insecure or love-driven teens who are experiencing their first loves, and for adults who want to remember what that felt like. Good shojo is becoming harder and harder to find, and while this show has its flaws, it definitely expresses that pure young romance feeling.The MC is very insecure and very naive. She is the definition of a youth who wants to experience love but doesn't know how, as well as a youth with talents they can't see the value of. She is the...epitome of a shy, socially awkward teenager. Her love interest is a Disney prince: everything he does, he does for her. Their relationship is a tad over the top, but all in all very cute. There is little remarkable to say about the plot, aside from that it takes place in a medieval fantasy and is quite cliche. The anime is less about plot and more about Elianna slowly becoming self-assured with the help of her Prince Charming. The vibes will resonate with people who grew up romanticizing love with unrealistic expectations (and there's nothing wrong with that).This show is not for people who have not read shojo manga before. This show is not for people who cannot emphasize with individuals with poor self esteem. This show is definitely not for people who prefer power fantasies, or underdog fantasies, or male harem s where the women have all the charm and the men do not.But if you want a beautifully animated show about a teenage girl's first love in a fantasy world, and can ignore some slight pacing issues, I recommend this show to you. epitome of a shy, socially awkward teenager.

Eliana is your typical shojo girl, pure, innocent, naive (too much) and a bookworm. At the start it didn't seem that except her book's interest she had something more to offer, in the second episode random stuff comes out like how she helped people with her knowledge thanks of aaaaall the years of reading and...people can acknowledge her as an ideal partner for Christopher. Well, in my opinion only Christopher is noteworthy. Not every male character in anime is shrewd, mature and knows what he wants and do something to get it! I don't really get why he fell in love with Eliana since he is smart and everything, but love has no rules.

For one, the special shows every single character attending the sports festival (even already dead characters). I myself enjoyed pointing out some people like the 4th Hokage and Itachi from the crowd. Second, the plot revolves around Naruto needing to use the restroom, but to his dismay, he just can\'t seem to find a toilet without interruptions.The animation in the Sports Festival is the same animation used in the actual movie, so it is high quality in terms of detail. The sound is... Well it sounds like what any Naruto scene would sound...like: Naruto sceaming, background music being fast-paced, and Naruto screaming some more. The characters pretty much act the same with Shino being his weird self and Shikamaru complaining about every little thing. But what got me was Hinata trying to tell Naruto her one dark secret about him. That seemed out of character to me.And as for the enjoyment part of the special? It really depends on whether you enjoy watching a 20 minute show full of nothing but ""I NEED TO FIND A TOILET!!!"" or not. Overall, this might be fun to watch the first time, but you really don\'t need to watch it a second time. like: Naruto sceaming, background music being fast-paced, and Naruto screaming some more.

Nothing much except it is the low point of all of Naruto(including all the fillers).To begin the story, Konoha is holding a sports festival and all the genin are competing including Naruto. Unfortunantly Naruto has the runs and tries to go poop all through the little special stopped every step of the way.The art is below average Naruto fare with the biggest problem being that all the background characters are major characters from the show, such as Itachi is viewable as are dead characters such as Haku and Zabuza.The...sound is normal for Naruto using all the voices however goes overboard on the fart sounds.The characters are all the characters just using their powers for humor such as Shino using his bugs, Shikamaru his shadow, etc.Overall this is the low point of a very good series, and to make a suggestion, just skip this and watch the movie alone.1/10 score sound is normal for Naruto using all the voices however goes overboard on the fart sounds.The characters are all the characters just using their powers for humor such as Shino using his bugs, Shikamaru his shadow, etc.Overall this is the low point of a very good series, and to make a suggestion, just skip this and watch the movie alone.1/10 score', ""This special add for the naruto series makes a great pass time for those tired of their serious life.A great humor (that really doesn't have anything to do with the original time flow of the series) makes it a light-hearted 'Special'.

Since it is about Naruto struggling to use the restroom real bad (no spoiler), it definitely has toilet humor and unless you like that, you might not really enjoy this short.

As the events of Shippuden haven’t happened yet so it’s nice seeing the characters before everything goes wrong.The light-hearted OVA can be treated as a break from the darker parts of this series. The absurd story, return of great animation, sound design, and entertaining character interactions make this episode something I don’t hate but just isn’t for me.Overall, I rank this 7/10.']"
Pokemon Movie 13: Genei no Hasha Zoroark,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7695/Pokemon_Movie_13__Genei_no_Hasha_Zoroark,"['So here we go again, with yet another movie to promote the famous franchise of Pokemon and entertain us by throwing random villains, powerful Pokemon and some explosions. Being those the primary objectives, Phantom Ruler Zoroark actually does a decent job. As a matter of fact, no matter how hard you try, it\'s impossible to see a single attempt of making a movie which sustains itself; all for the sake of advertisement. So why bother writing a review? Exactly because of this uncompromised environment, allowing the viewer to simply erase everything in his mind and enjoy an equally uncompromised experience.Quality-wise, the movie holds the tradition...and invests on eye candy visuals to grasp attention — since this job isn\'t very suitable to the plot or characters, but we\'ll talk about these latter. Fluid animation and CGI effects are elements essential in order to build some exciting action scenes, which absolutely cannot be removed of a Pokemon movie. The character design... well, it\'s the same as always: generic and childish, but it\'s part of the franchise\'s style, so you can\'t avoid it. The sound? Oh, yes, there is sound. It\'s not like Pokemon\'s voice actors lack emotion, though that\'s precisely the case of the soundtrack, but probably the lame ones are the characters themselves. Not even Wakamoto Norio could do something to help if he wanted.Speaking of characters, that\'s a somewhat difficult to analyse item in the franchise\'s movies: you can\'t discuss about the protagonists because their development happens in the original series, since the movie is merely another adventure, but you can\'t simply discard them. Nevertheless, what doesn\'t change is the fact that characters serve, amongst other purposes, as means to get the viewer\'s empathy or hate. Phantom Ruler Zoroark fails at both, whether at the good or the bad side.Let\'s start with the villain perspective for a change: a one-sided dude who wants power at all cost despite any consequences. Oh, we\'ve never seen this type before, right? The interesting part is that he really doesn\'t give the vibes of a big bad guy many times. I mean, he is bad all right, but who is he against? The three legendary dogs, Celebi, Zoroark and Zorua. The previous two don\'t seem much of a threat, but have you ever tried to mess with a son in front of the mother? Don\'t even try, as that\'s definitely not a good idea. And his ability doesn\'t help too much because he can see an immutable future, meaning no one can change it.As for heroes, you have Ash, his usual gang and a couple of random guys. This time there isn\'t even a back story or something, they are simply pawns used to face the villain. Actually, facing the villain isn\'t really their jobs; instead, all they do during the whole movie is: distract enemies, help setting traps and other minor chores. The rest us up to Zoroark, Raikou, Entei, Suicune and Celebi. Look, Director-san, Writer-san, no one is saying that Ash needs to be a legendary hero destined to save the world in every single movie (I don\'t even like him), but c\'mon, he is the freaking main character!Surprisingly, the narrative is pretty good for a Pokemon movie. Of course, this whole time travels/future stuff has been explored many times, twice just in Pokemon movies, but the plot flows well enough. Little by little the pieces come along: first there is a problem, then our heroes try to solve it, while at the same time we have a cunning villain making his moves and the legendary dogs trio observing the situation. Eventually the good guys figure out the villain\'s plan and use his own scheme to defeat him. A pretty straight forward approach, but it works.Anyway, the main question remains: ""Should I watch this?"", to which I can answer with another interrogation: ""Well, why not?"". Phantom Ruler Zoroark is overall a nice family movie, although teenagers who are not fans may want to skip this, offering mindless fun with cute, likable and innocent monsters fighting against an evil ambitious man. Just think how many moral lessons the parents will be able to elaborate! ... Not really an exciting thought, but there is some good amount of action scenes for those with a fare for adrenaline. As for the fans who withstood every single movie until now, one more shouldn\'t hurt. and invests on eye candy visuals to grasp attention — since this job isn\'t very suitable to the plot or characters, but we\'ll talk about these latter.

Unlike Lucario's film before it, which was an ambitious attempt at a grand adventure, Zoroark's film is mostly content with keeping itself inside one unremarkable town. Everything lies in execution, though, so lets analyze the film.The most notable thing that sold the film to the audience is the titular star, Zoroark. Being a furry bipedal creature with an elongated face and no legendary status, Zoroark has a few more-than-passing similarities with Lucario, the star of the eight Pokemon film. Personality...wise, the two are nothing like each other. As for their role in their respective pictures, the two share no similarities. Thus, we can lay to rest any accusations of plagiarism.The main plot is pretty weak. It hinges on the personalities of Zoroark and the main villain to keep us interested. Zoroark performs his job with good marks. He's nice to watch, menacing and his powers give us enough eye candy to enjoy most of his shenanigans. Kodai, on the other hand is a mixed bag. After witnessing terrible villains such as Marauder or Zero in previous Pokemon films, it's hard hate Kodai much. He often falls flat and his incredible wealth is a bit hard to believe, but at least  it's some kind of an explanation for his high tech gadgets.Ash and company feel like simple audience stand-ins in this one. Their job is to watch, comment and keep up with Zoroark. They're given some interesting dialogue and a few funny quips as Zorua, Zoroark's child, plays with them. This keeps them from getting annoying and keeps the dialogue fresh. Throughout the film we're introduced to a few additional supporting characters and they're used efficiently, albeit conservatively.Soundtrack is uninspired and while the art design is nice to look at, it lacks an outstanding location or two. The location of the final showdown is underwhelming, as well. These two form the biggest crime this film committed - it felt uninspired. When a film you're making focuses on a singular Pokemon star, it's understandable to put the plot and other characters in the backseat, but the presentation should still matter.As a hype piece for Zoroark, this film did well. As a stand alone Pokemon adventure, it barely passes. Zorua & Zoroark are always present and as the only characters who are given constant care in the writing/animation department, they continuously save the film. There are a few moderately fun battles, but generally the film feels like it could have been much more. Underwhelming. wise, the two are nothing like each other.

Zoroark was a bit hard to grasp, although still interesting.The plot was quite effective, the art was good, and the presence of Legendary Beasts (Raikou, Entei and Suicune) definitely rocked.This was the first time Unova Pokémon were introduced. It was kept vague, though, which is nice seeing as Ash's story is not taking him to Unova just yet.The villain, Kodai with a fading ability to see his own future, was somewhat interesting, but the rest...of the new characters were left a little thin: none were overwhelmingly deep or momentous. They did their thing, served their purpose, and kept the story moving.All things considered, the plot was solid and entertaining, didn't fail too badly at anything, and the movie was thoroughly enjoyable. of the new characters were left a little thin: none were overwhelmingly deep or momentous.

It was always so childish, and I thought they could do so much more. However, the producers totally step it up in every way when making the movies.The story is about Zoroark and how it is both a good guy and a bad guy. The sound and artwork is pretty good, but the story is too bland in my opinion and they are always making lame plot twists that could have been more interesting. The Pokemon battles left me bored, and the new characters were boring as well....I did not enjoy this very much, and I thought it was a horrible way to promote the 5th generation of Pokemon. More importantly, it didn't leave me with that feeling of nostalgia that the early Pokemon movies did.I'm not saying that you shouldn't watch this, but I'm warning you not to have high expectations as this movie is incomparable to Pokemon 2000 or Pokemon Heroes.

They throw in all the new characters that shown up in the movie and they just do much except...watch Ash and friends deal with everything. As for the feature Pokemon, there was pretty much no reason for them to even be included in the film and can just be easily replaced by anything.Enjoyment: Nothing noteworthy. Just simple attacks in pretty much every scene and no actual battling.

Nakanohito Genome [Jikkyouchuu],https://myanimelist.net/anime/37926/Nakanohito_Genome_Jikkyouchuu,"['A great anime that for some reason went almost unnoticed in the most lackluster season of the year.The story is nothing spectacular and the show has so many main characters that its harsh to focus and develop a single plot on only 12 episodes without eliminating the relevance of the other characters.With that being said i feel like we ended up having a good understanding of almost every MC on this 12 episodes. Iride and Himiko ended up less developed than the others but to a certain point i can understand this choice since mistery is kind of a part of their character.Art wise this...feels a lot like Kagerou Project. That being said this is a better Mekakucity Actors than MekaActors itself, balancing characters screen time, not disrespecting the characters personality from the source and not overcomplicating anything.Sound wise aside from Anya who sounded like a angsty brat 100% of the show i felt that the VA was fantastic. Yuzu in particular is incredible with all the shifts in emotion that the character goes trough.All the characters have a certain charm to them (except the white haired guy since it feels like he is the most childish of them all after Anya. Hell i cant even remember his name).All the characters get almost the same ammount of development.I was looking forward to the show every week altough after the first episodes i realized that the show was way more lighthearted than i was expecting.This isn\'t bad at all since many shows are sickeningly boring when every single new plot point is: ""If you fail, you die"" and you damn well know that they arent going to die. AKA every single shounen out there.Finally. No this is not a Danganronpa clone, this is something else with a similar plot.Danganronpa anime is complete garbage anyways. feels a lot like Kagerou Project.

This is a more fitting title to this show.The plot: random streamers are abducted to play some games and will be released when they hit a view count. The start itself is not the problem, execution is: games are so random in each episode that I got more and more frustrated from episode to episode. Some mutant overgrown pandas, mimic plants that can even copy personality traits, ghosts and demons, hi-tech cameras and a ghost town to the top - what is going on, who even thought that those things bunched together would make something wholesome? It feels...more like some kind of bingo, where all the ""cool stuff"" got tossed into the pot disregarding setting and if those things are a good match between each other. Oh, and cherry on top: this anime doesn\'t even cover the source completely, so it is not a full story, so this whole mess is never explained properly.Art and sound: average in every way, nothing to add.Characters: another big problem. Everyone is supposed to be a streamer, I am ok with that. But can you tell me, since when streamers have highly letal poison vials or flashbangs? And the characters themselves aren\'t really complex, everyone pretty simple with a single ""drama"" trait to show in their personal moment.Enjoyment: none. All 12 episodes I was more confused than amused, more trying to figure out what is going on than enjoying the show.Overall: can\'t recommend, at best it is some nieche anime, at worst - waste of time. more like some kind of bingo, where all the ""cool stuff"" got tossed into the pot disregarding setting and if those things are a good match between each other.

No, but that\'s totally fine. If you go into with your expectations at a level for an anime adaptation of a web manga you will not be disappointed.I\'ll loosely go over the points.(May contain slight spoilers for episode 1, but that\'s all)Story (7/10):The story isn\'t particular interesting nor is it original. A group of let\'s players are stuck in a mysterious game that they don\'t remember entering and they have to get 1 million views on the livestream of the show...to be released. They\'ll get punished if they don\'t follow the rules, yadda yadda.Let\'s start by addressing the elephant in the room; is this a Danganronpa copy?Absolutely and absolutely not. The concepts, adorable mascot, character designs (though more ""modern"" here) and character archetypes are absolutely in alignment with what you\'d expect from a Danganronpa game, but rather than just being another trifle copy of a beloved franchise, it manages to encapsulate it\'s own aura and charm. Think of it as some of the amazing Danganronpa-styled spin-offs you see everywhere, but even more original.The let\'s player thing is a bit cheesy, but also extremely adorable and it makes the characters easier to remember and ""characterize"".As for the brutality of the show, it\'s not anywhere near the level of Danganronpa. The viewer is told in episode 1 that they\'ll be punished for not following the rules, but the punishment they\'re shown is somewhat weak and doesn\'t actually shock you in the way it does in Danganronpa.This may be plot related, however, as these stories tend to have a meaning in the smaller details, so it\'s not a big issues for me, personally.Overall, it\'s not fantastic, but if you curb your enthusiasm a bit and take it for what it is, you\'ll enjoy it.Art (9/10)This part is easily one of the best parts of the shows. The amount of detail put into each episode is ASTOUNDING and I\'m surprised more people haven\'t giffed the shit out of the show. The artstyle itself is rather simplistic and ""Pixiv-esque"" (you know what I mean when you see it), but it\'s what they do with these characters. I don\'t remember any glaringly huge moments where they go off-model and look like blobs in the background, which in itself is a huge feat.Each episode, they change up the art style for the different settings, challenges and touching moments. In episode 1\'s touching moment, they completely change up the lineart style and coloring and it looks amazing and perfectly emphasizes the mood they\'re trying to capture. There are so many places where the changes directly influence and enhance the story, whether it be the comedic timing, amount of animation, etc.It really feels like some meaningful thinking went into creating the artistic side of this series and it\'s MUCH appreciated.Sound (7/10)I would write a long segment for this, but I honestly don\'t remember much of the music. It\'s inoffensive, modern, and doesn\'t really get in the way of the mood. It\'s not something memorable, but definitely not something that pulls you out of setting.The opening is kinda boring, very generic, but I\'m sure someone will find it enjoyable so do give it a listen.Characters (10/10)Giving it a 10 out of 10 may be a bit of an overkill, but honestly, much like it\'s forefather Danganronpa, the characters are what carry the show.The guys are great, the girls are great and they\'re all memorable, quirky, and fun! Sometimes, in these big ensembles, some characters bleed into the background or get the short end of the stick, but they\'re really just all important and interesting. The weakest one at the moment is the main character, but that\'s to be expected of these types of stories and at least the story is self-aware enough to feel like a parody on the ""hope inspiring protagonist"".All the characters are let\'s players, as mentioned earlier, and this brings some great gap moe moments. They have great twists to their personality which will make even the coldest of hearts melt just a bit. The pure dedication and love that each character has their genre of game is also incredibly endearing.Also, for people who are worried about the characterization of women in anime, I will gladly announce that they get just as much depth and spark in them as the boys do, maybe even more so (since they\'re in the minority).Honestly I can\'t describe well how great these characters are, so if you like these types of character driven comedy/drama shows with a big ensemble, do give it a try!Enjoyment (8/10)What is there to say which haven\'t been said? Despite it\'s cliché story, it\'s still a highly entertaining watch because of the characters and visuals.Overall (8/10)Calling this show a Danganronpa copy or ""just another death game"" is highly insulting and should not be taken to heart. Sports, harem, idol, and other sub-genres of anime all share the same overall themes and ideas, but that doesn\'t mean of them are worse than the others for having said genre.Nakanohito Genome carries itself as a different story to Danganronpa with it\'s great visuals and characters and is a MUST WATCH for any fan of the genre!For anyone else, why not give it a shot?

It might surprise you!', 'The first episode of The Ones Within made me feel like a kid again. There’s plenty of anime with gaming gimmicks coming out every year. However, The Ones Within played its cards by mixing together a mystery plot with a colorful cast of characters and peculiar humor. If you thought the mystery genre was lacking this year, then I do have some good news for you.Series director Shin Oouma has a collective resume although none of his previous work dealt with game gimmicks. Often times, people may see this series as just another game show with high stakes. Of course, such ideas isn’t exactly refreshing...in the anime industry. We’ve had anime like Danganronpa where a group of characters are thrown into a labyrinth of chaos and mystery. Likewise, The Ones Within takes advantage of its premise by throwing the characters into unusual settings. These settings adapts the game gimmick formula with high stakes and variety. From the first few episodes, I got convinced this anime is something to look forward to beyond that what it looks on the surface.With the amount of promotional material, The Ones Within is by no means a mainstream show. Or in fact, one could call this a niche anime, perhaps targeted to fans familiar with mystery. Before this even got an anime adaptation, I had been reading this and it only occurred to me now that the show could work with the amount of material it contains. Indeed, the plot structure takes the main premise and turns it into an evolving plot with every episode introducing different games with different stakes. While the show isn’t an anthology, it does create a feel of how different each episode is an adventure of its own. The variety of games includes dating simulations, saving people from Oni, conquering dungeons, and many more. Each episode also contains a view count that stylizes itself with the gimmick of the show. The way I see it is how the director wanted to really make the anime feel like a game. Rather than just thrown in as a gimmick, the anime appeals to the game show genre that truly embrace itself for what it is. And with our contestants, you can bet there’s going to be a lot of challenges they must overcome.Now I’m not a prophet but judging on the abilities of the characters, I’m guessing the author had some experience with a variety of game genres. The main characters all specializes in different fields of gaming such as Akatsuki’s skill in escape games, Himiko in nurturing simulation, Yuzu in puzzle solving, Zakuro in stealth, Anya in fighting, Karin in horror, Makino with dating simulation, and Kaikoku in Japanese games. Many of these episodes depends on their special talent in order to clear the stage. In fact, without their specialized skills, the characters would fail together. Collectively, the characters gets along on a fundamental level although there’s drama that spawns occasionally between each other. It’s mostly lighthearted humor although it’s noticeable that the main cast all have troubled pasts. As the plot advances more and more, we are given glimpses of how some of that past influences their present personalities. However, the audience shouldn’t come into this show expecting some form of character study. They also don’t develop over time because let’s face it, the anime treats this as a game show. There’s stages, rules, and punishments for those who breaks them. The character chemistry and relationships mostly come from the time these players spend together. And with the amount of games we witness, you can bet that characters have to work strategically to win.A main question to ask yourself is what you want out of this show. Is it the psychological elements of the mind games of each episode? Is it to see if the characters can beat the challenges to the end? Or are you in just to see how the show tackles on such a mystery premise? Watching The Ones Within has a bit of all of these traits combined with doses of comedy. I’m not going to lie, for a mystery show, it doesn’t truly take itself seriously at times despite the stakes. It isn’t one of those psychological thrillers with jump scares or shadowy suspense. In fact, every time the episode ended, it felt like watching a game show than a mystery thriller. The more you come to understand this show, the more it becomes enjoyable.Before even watching this anime, the character designs reminded me of Kagerou Daze. The mixed media project isn’t related to this series but the designs sparks a feeling of familiarity. The Ones Within heavily relies on character’s body language to do the talking. Their every move has attention to detail whether it’s during their strategy planning or utilizing their special skills on certain stages. On the more lighthearted side, character expressions often gives more of a cartoony look. Some characters also behave more childish than they may appear such as the case with Yuzu. As one of the more sarcastic characters, she brings a certain amount of fan service when interacting with the female cast, in particular Karin. But who am I to judge if she swings that way? The character that overshadows her sarcasm is an even stranger character named Paka. With the face of an animal in a suit, you’re in for a real treat of strangeness.Having a show taking on such a strange premise reminds us that anyone can make anything work if they put their mind to it. The Ones Within may not be a masterpiece but it managed to convince me how each episode ties together with its genres and themes. From the first episodes to the final one, it kept its feet together and walked the path of creative story. Now, the character cast might not be your cup of tea. Quite frankly, I think this show suffers a bit from its multi-personality character cast, such that it suffers from the stuffing too many eggs in one basket. But if you do overlook that and follow their adventures to heart, then what you get is something you won’t regret. in the anime industry. We’ve had anime like Danganronpa where a group of characters are thrown into a labyrinth of chaos and mystery. Likewise, The Ones Within takes advantage of its premise by throwing the characters into unusual settings. These settings adapts the game gimmick formula with high stakes and variety. From the first few episodes, I got convinced this anime is something to look forward to beyond that what it looks on the surface.With the amount of promotional material, The Ones Within is by no means a mainstream show. Or in fact, one could call this a niche anime, perhaps targeted to fans familiar with mystery. Before this even got an anime adaptation, I had been reading this and it only occurred to me now that the show could work with the amount of material it contains. Indeed, the plot structure takes the main premise and turns it into an evolving plot with every episode introducing different games with different stakes. While the show isn’t an anthology, it does create a feel of how different each episode is an adventure of its own. The variety of games includes dating simulations, saving people from Oni, conquering dungeons, and many more. Each episode also contains a view count that stylizes itself with the gimmick of the show. The way I see it is how the director wanted to really make the anime feel like a game. Rather than just thrown in as a gimmick, the anime appeals to the game show genre that truly embrace itself for what it is.

But if you do overlook that and follow their adventures to heart, then what you get is something you won’t regret.', 'Sometimes I do let my critical eye ruin the enjoyment of a show that has peaked my interest yet has flaws to it. The only option I have is to either ignore them and just enjoy what’s in front of me or embrace it and criticize the s**t out of it. The reason I say all this because this is exactly how I feel about this show. A show that I like but has flaws. But why though? Well I’ll tell you.Sit back relax, put on a headset, turn on a camera and do a livestream as you are reading this as I present...to you the anime review for Nakanohito Genome [Jikkyouchuu], or by its English name, The Ones Within. Lets begin.Story: 6/10The story begins with our eight main characters (who are all lets players by the way) completing the game “Nakanohito Genome” and after getting the message “We will come get you,” they wake up; seemingly in the middle of nowhere with giant animals for some reason. They are greeted by a man in a llama mask (or a head, your guess) by the name of Paka and tells our main cast that they are selected to do a real life lets play of Nakanohito Genome and reach 100,000,000 views for the viewing public\'s entertainment. Once they do that, they are all free.I wouldn’t blame you if you got some Danganrompa vibes immediately after watching this show. The shows premise and vibes are similar to that of Danganrompa but it manages to differentiate itself rather quickly by explaining its setting and the narrative. Instead of a murder mystery, its some real life lets plays. The lets plays are the core of the show with the cast spending about one or two episodes completing a lets play challenge so that they can reach the 100,000,000 view mark and go home with the stakes getting higher and higher. Although I do wish with the challenges were more diverse instead of being another version of a survival horror challenge. Granted it does do that occasionally like a dating sim or a simple puzzle game, but it is mainly a different version of a horror lets play almost every time. If you want to raise the stakes, a puzzle platformer or even a shooter could do that with the right context. So I just wanted them to be more diverse.The challenges themselves though, despite my criticisms, are still entertaining with their different spin on things every time so we don’t always get the same challenge they present to us. My favourite one is when they have to hide from 3 sister maids inside their rooms for an hour. If the maids spot you once, they blind you. If they spot you again while you are blind, they gouge your eyes out. The only way to unblind someone is by getting touched by someone who isn’t blind. It adds some real tension to the challenge knowing that something extremely painful will happen if you are not careful. The show kind of relies on these challenges though to add some urgency because outside of the challenges, there is little urgency. The characters are in no rush to get out of where they are, which is strange that they are forced to do this task and have no other choice doing so but are in no rush to get out of doing it? It makes up for it by moving at a good pace but I feel like some more urgency would help give a better realisation of where they are right now.Of course, them having no idea where they are or why leaves some mystery aspects to the show. The main mystery of the show, Paka and the truth behind Nakanohito Genome is alright. It adds an extra layer to show that makes you intrigued about the truth and why this island hosts giant Pandas, Daemons and killer, shape shifting plants but I never really felt that this was something I really wanted to know and I just waited to see what would happen. The more intriguing mystery was the mystery behind one of the main leads, Yuzu Roromori and why she is infatuated with our...well I guess the main main protagonist of the series, Iride Akatsuki. That was the more, “I want to know more” mystery that kept me watching because with how well our characters interact with each other, what would happen if they all knew Yuzu’s secret.Characters: 7/10So I only mentioned it at the end of the story section but without a doubt the best thing about this show for me was the chemistry between our main leads. It made for some of the more entertaining moments of the show. Whether it was Iridie and Anya slowly growing friendship orYuzu being a total s**tstirer towards Karin, the chemistry between our main leads just works. So I like the chemistry between the characters, its just that their development is rather lacklustre. We don’t know much about them throughout the show but we do get some reveals about their past and perhaps some connection as to why they are here. But other than that, there is not much else. Their growth is dependant on how well they interact with one another. While you could say they succeeded in that regard (and you would be right), in terms of personal development though, they hardly change.Paka perhaps being the most mysterious character in the show would make him one of the main core factors of the show. The thing is though is that I really didn’t care much about who he really is and why is he doing this. I only see him as a plot device to get the main cast from one lets play challenge to another. He’s shown he wants them to succeed but at the same time, will punish anyone is violating the rules. So is he a meddling director? Or something else entirely? So there are some aspects that make him an intriguing character, but also one where the mystery around him isn’t really that interesting.Animation: 5/10The animation for this show was fine if a bit generic. Not bad but certainly not impressive. The art style was rather generic and didn’t really have a rather unique style that I think could have benefited here given its premise and setting. A missed opportunity really. The character designs are more sensible than I expected yet they still match the characters personality and background. It is nice they didn’t go ridiculous but they are a bit bland.Sound: 5.5/10You can say a similar thing to the ost in this series. It’s fine but its not something I will particularity remember in the future. It does it job to set an atmosphere but its not noticeable enough to grab you get your attention. So it is rather meh overall.The opening, ""not GAME"" by Tasuku Hatanaka has more style and a better song than the animation and soundtrack combined. It certainly shows off what kind of personality the characters have and the vibrant use of colours is refreshing compared to what we get from the show. The song also has a nice rhythm to it and keeps pace with the visuals that makes this opening very solid.The ending sequence, ""Boku wo Mitsukete” by fhána also does well at portraying the character’s personalities but not as well as the opening I would say. The song is nice and calming while we go through the ending so like the opening, rather solid but not as good as the opening.Conclusion:I really like this show, but only if I ignore the flaws. If I watch it at face value, then I can get enjoyment out of this series. But since I’m reviewing it, then I have to say that the show has quite a bit of flaws to it and only a couple of things from the show is done really well, in this case, its the character’s chemistry and the lets play challenges. The mystery isn’t all that intriguing, the character development is lacking and the animation and soundtrack is rather mediocre. This show is definitely one of those shows that if you don’t think about it too hard and take what you get, it’s a fun show. And despite my criticisms, it is a really fun show to watch. So I’ll make a rare exception where i’ll actually give this show the “Watch it” recommendation because despite its flaws, this is one of the more fun shows to watch this season.My personal enjoyment: 8.5/10Overall Score: 6.4/10 Recommendation: Watch it to you the anime review for Nakanohito Genome [Jikkyouchuu], or by its English name, The Ones Within.

Let me explain this.The fact of the sheep (Animal) and the different abilities of the mc's are similar to Danganronpa's plot.Also the different levels in that world are similar to SAO's structure. But, what makes this story interesting is that they need ''views'', which is also similar to danganronpa but with another touch.·Art: 6/10...Art in general is pretty good, but I'm not giving it more mark just because the scenes on this anime don't need too much effort to be made.(Most of the scenes are relaxed and with no action)·Sound: 5/10The effects and music aren't the best, dialogs are pretty simple and aren't original enough.Maybe putting some dramatic or emotional music in some parts would upgrade the quality of this anime.·Character: 6/10As I said before, the personalities of this anime remind me to Danganronpa's style. Each of the mc's have different abilities and personalities, which some aren't defined yet.I think it would improve if they could give more attention to the details of the mc's personalities, because they are pretty basic and common.·Enjoyment: 4/10The development of the history is being slow for me.

Just imagine something like that of a cyberpunk being mixed with supernatural, horror and mystery were a combination of something that proves to be lackluster with a lotta mismatch things that goes around this shit, so how do I rate this shit?????? Here\'s how:Story-Poor 3: The story plot was obviously a cheap imitation of Dagaronpa, where the original creator a certain Osora  adds a lotta elements...here that its game genre proves to be very  much a lackluster, TBH, they should have focus on the cyberpunk aspect of the anime, since it was all connected to a game crated by the character Iride.Art-Poor 3: When we talk about the characters attire what we see was a reflection of their attitude, but Paka to be Paka was soooooo lame.Sound-Pathetic 1: That\'s for Iride\'s voice, cu\'z it was soooo annoying, cu\'z from it\'s tone you can say that he\'s both crazy and nosy.Character- Dreadful 2: Ok let\'s go over each character:Iride Akatsuki- Ok so he\'s friendly, kind and gentle, but unfortunately, he was just annoying , cu\'z basically thought he like to be the first one to do the challenges set by Paka, to me he\'s just a show off and pretty much this meddling SOB in which you wanna punch him hard in the face.Karin Sarayashiki- A Tsundere, who like to stream horror games, but what\'s disgusting about her was her double standard , yes she was a horror game freak, but  she happens to be scared shit of real ghost and other supernatural. If this were Daganronpa, I would have preferred that she dies first in a horrible way.Kaikoku Onigasaki- A Sengoku era gamer, he has the chance to join up with the resistance, but ends up going back with the others, he should have been eaten by that giant gold fish.Anya Kudō- For him to be this fighter game expert, was basically a waste of his role , where he could\'ve have been a protagonist who can kick Paka\'s ass.Zakuro Oshigiri- To me, he basically doesn\'t belong in this kind of shit, and instead, his character ought be in one of those generic iskai themed anime.Himiko Inaba- So, for her to be carrying Flash bangs was also a waste of her character who was portrayed as this cry baby gamer whose mode of dominance was to use her flash bangs on anybody who is rowdy.Yuzu Roromori- She would have been a good fit to be Midari\'s (from Kakeguri) bestie, and if this is Danganronpa, she\'ll fit in as a psychotic antagonist.Makino Aikawa- He\'d be better of if he were to be the 2nd one to die, if this were to be Daganronpa.Paka- Oh Paka Ding Dong Ding Niegh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!He be better off being kicked in the ass by the psycho Teddy Bear in Danganronpa.Enjoyment-Poor 3: I was hoping that somebody will die, but too bad that there were no death flag.Overall- Dreadful 2: Cu\'z this basically says ""How not to make a Danganronpa knock off.""

I admit that's not the most innovate premise for anime, thanks to the oversaturation of the isekai genre and anime with game-like features, but what makes this show interesting is the creative solutions used...by the protagonists to overcome their challenges.The show manages to strike a good balance between comedy and drama. For the most part, The Ones Within is cheerful and light-hearted, but it's not afraid of getting ominous, especially when some characters evolve or encounter life-threatening challenges. I really enjoyed the themes of friendship and hope even in the face of adversity, which can be appreciated by a vast majority of viewers. (8/10)CharactersOne of the strongest aspects of this show is the character writing. The Ones Within is pretty good at getting the characters to bounce off each other, getting used to each other's quirks and becoming closer as a team. We have eternal optimist Akatsuki, mysterious Zakuro, aggressive Anya, kind-hearted Himiko, humorous Yuzu, confrontational Karin, relaxed Kaikoku and stoic Makino as our main characters.The closest thing the show has to a primary antagonist is Paka, a guy who wears an alpaca mask and controls the games that our team must complete. Even so, calling Paka a villain might not be entirely accurate, as he is not above helpng the gamers every once in a while, not to mention he develops some kind of affection towards Akatsuki.The show's brand of humor is pretty good at getting the characters outside their comfort zones and adapting them to their new circumstances. It's funny to see otherwise serious Zakuro and Kaikoku get into some kind of comedic incident. The opposite can happen as well, with light-hearted characters like Akatsuki and Himiko enduring some kind of poignant event, like helping someone in trouble and having their lives threatened for some reason.All of this, and more, is what makes the cast of The Ones Within so entertaining to watch. (9/10)ArtWhile the character designs are fairly average, I really liked the attention that went into the backgrounds, the gaming effects and the opening and closing credits. All in all, the animation hands itself pretty well. (8/10)SoundBoth the opener and the closer are fun, and the soundtrack features some pretty catching songs, as well. Props should also be given to the talented voicing cast, which includes the likes of Justin Briner, Marissa Lenti, Stephen Fu, Kristi Rothrock, among others. The voice actors have excellent chemistry with one another, whic his signficantly enhanced by the strength and accurate of the script. (9/10)OverallIn closing here, The Ones Within is a criminally underrated show. Its interesting story, likeable characters, hilarious comedy and amazing soundtrack make this show a true diamond in the rough. A new episode, with involvement from the manga's creator, has been greenlit, so fans of this show won't have to wait too long to see these characters again. All in all, this was a fine show and I totally recommend it. (8/10) by the protagonists to overcome their challenges.The show manages to strike a good balance between comedy and drama.

The very best streamer, in each genre of game, was transported to another world, where in Truman Show-esq fashion, their every move is viewed by a certain populace, whether that\'s world-wide, or galaxywide, we\'ll never know. Their goal, is to reach 100 million viewers, while completing games tasked to them by an Alpaca. Not just any alpaca, one that walks upright, and speaks as well.Story: As I said, this was a refreshing take on the isekai genre in my opinion. There\'s so much of...people being teleported to another world, and expected to be the hero of the world, but, in Nakanohito Genome, they don\'t have to change much about themselves to thrive in their adventure. The premise that a group of video game streamers are tossed into a world, with really, nothing in common, outside of their love for video games, and being the most popular streamer in their respective genres, was interesting enough. Now, add in games, which they have to work together to complete, and you get some nice character dynamics.Art: I enjoyed the art, and animation in this. The characters were interesting in varying ways, appearance wise, and the various environments where their games took place, were always interesting or well drawn in some shape or form. Nothing breathtaking here, but enjoyable none-the-less.Sound: Loved the opening, it\'s a song I have tossed into my regular spotify playlist, and still enjoy when it pops up during shuffle. The voice acting was decent, nothing insane, but never left me with a bad taste either.Characters: Well, I felt like it was a strong suit here. They all had their own quirky personalities, as well as their personal lives that we got a glimpse into from time to time, albeit, sometimes too brief, and left you wanting to know more (LOOKIN AT YOU INABA). Also, if you ever wanted to see a panda school girl, with an afro, this is for you!Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this, I consider it the best isekai this season, in all honesty. I think a lot of that comes from the fact that it is at least a little bit unique to the genre. They left the door open for a second season as well, so, here\'s hoping!Overall: 8/10. This was another one of my top animes for the season personally. I think it was a sleeper, and flew under the radar as well, and think it\'s a good watch for anyone who enjoys isekais, but is feeling a little burnt out on the overused ""becoming a hero in another world"" trope. people being teleported to another world, and expected to be the hero of the world, but, in Nakanohito Genome, they don\'t have to change much about themselves to thrive in their adventure.

The characters work extremely well together and it even got me to read the original source (Manga). This adaptation did the best it could have done since it seems it had a low budget. However, that hardly ruins the enjoyment for me but it may do for other people and if it does, it can be looked over as there is so much to offer in a short space of 12 episodes.I can see why people compare it to...Danganronpa but this is it's own media. The characters are simple but executed in quirky ways and a lot of fun to understand on a deeper level if the commitment is there. The comedy is fantastic with references to characterisation of one specific character: Makino, as an example. He sleeps all of the time and it's simple yet effective due to the fact you always expect it but it's shown in unexpected ways to lift tension and to fit the comedy genre. In the OVA there were repeated segments of him just sleeping but the very last one was him actually waking up, to only fall back asleep. There is really a lot to enjoy about the flow of comedy here.The art style is pretty good (yet stiff*) and the attention to detail from the atmosphere with it like... how they tend to raise their hands on a majority vote: It's not just copy and paste for all characters, they all do it in their own way; my favourite being Iride having an over-exaggerated tone that is definitely ear-splitting (that's the charm on it) but compared to Anya being reluctant to raise his hand as he couldn't give a sh*t (more charm to character.) To add, the last episode, they all have outfits that agree with their quirk which was entertaining. The style also reflects on the mood of the characters, emphasising a serious or special moment: changing the colour palette or adding more flare to the visuals. Stuff like these are very small but great to draw attention in.*This really does depend on the budget here. It did do a really good job but at times can be stiff and not as fluid as some frames should be.The sound is also neat. There isn't much to consider but the opening is quite catchy and actually sung by the Japanese VA for Anya so that's a nice touch. The soundtrack otherwise is compiled with J-pop songs at the end that really don't fit with the ethos the show has to offer at some scenes. It's quite fitting in it's own way though, as a reminder that it shouldn't be taken so seriously.In hindsight this series is just a bunch of laughs and easy to immerse yourself into.If there were to be more of a serious critique to take on the story itself then consider to look at the very few moments where some characters are shown to have an upsetting past. It's immersive to theorise that this whole series depicts the coping mechanism of escapism and how they were brought into a simulation to really draw the viewer in as well to reflect on the psychology it was going for. To be honest, in the anime, it wasn't shown much at all and wasn't portrayed the best and was just made to present witty humour, with the serious-ness only previewed in flashes. If it was emphasised more, even with episodes dedicated to it, it would be more of a token to appreciate the characters on a personal level.You can take this series seriously and analyse it like a nerd or just watch/read it to get a dopamine rush and that is what there is to love about it. It really needs more of a chance to be appreciated for what it is. Danganronpa but this is it's own media.

Now don't go getting upset that i just dissed your favorite anime or something cause there are positive aspects of this show to talk about, but my main issue overall is it has so much wasted potential and doesn't know how to keep tension despite acting like one of those shows where everyone is trapped in a job and suspicious of one another.The Good Aspects: The idea behind each character having to use their gaming genre of expertise to help complete tasks to reach the amount of views required to win and escape where they are at is quite an interesting concept sort of like Danganronpa without the killing aspect (of which MANY seem to blatantly compare it too…). The characters themselves are honestly interesting and when they TRY (keyword try) to make each character have something serious or mysterious going on with them it actually makes me want to figure out what’s up with them more (at least it did for a VERY short amount of time…). What they come up with for games for them to play and how they have to choose who plays them is also a good aspect, I find it quite interesting that some of the NPC type characters who are meant to be obstacles for them during the game seem to be doing so because they have no choice (it doesn’t add up to anything so it’s not a spoiler really, more like a ‘The Ones Within theory talking point if anything). The art was definitely not plain Jane bland which is nice but it’s just a bit above the cut so nothing spectacular. The character interactions I found enjoyable but I’m sure aren’t for everybody.The Bad Aspects: this show can’t decide whether it’s a slice of life game show with dramatic tension, or a undertone serious story with slice of life elements on top to keep everything seeming happy to later reveal a dark sinister truth down the line but mostly leans towards being a slice of life game show because none of the serious elements are relevant enough to make any difference if they haven’t already been debunked or disproven. They seem to just through characters backstory/trauma or and way the other players get to know them in willy-nilly if they aren’t the characters who take center stage for one reason or another like Aikawa. Towards the very end of the show they’re just like “oh, yeah. We know almost nothing about this guy so I guess let’s just give him a random ass reason why he’s usually alone and sleeping, that’ll work right?” I’m not saying the reason they gave him was bad per say but the resolution was completely bullshit considering NONE of the other characters really paid him all that much mind throughout the show and in the end one character just kinda “knows” the reason and he comes back because he seeing his fellow streamers are there for him or some shit? It felt forced as HELL.Many interesting elements and places they see along the way (that they can go back to ANYTIME) are just one shots that we never explore or visit again most likely due to the series only being 12 episodes and apparently a 13th none-aired episode long, but there’s so much nothing in those 12 episodes it’s sad and to see what it could have been and the its only 12 episodes point doesn’t apply to its lack of build up because other shows with less episodes had great build up like Problem Children are Coming From Another World Aren’t They? That only had 10 with an 11th bonus episode. Something that also bugged me is the quirks the streamers had like one who’s good at horror games being scare of anything remotely horror like… you were choice because you were good at playing that type of game and you can’t stand it IRL? Not just stupid and gimmicky. There’s also the nurture and farm game streamer who apparently carries around flashbang grenades? Their used for comic relief and to lower tension when people are fighting but it makes 0 sense and seems more hurtful than helpful (especially if you know what an ACTUAL flashbang can do to your ears and hearing, it’s not pretty). Also to simply note without spoilers the ending is trash. Maybe in the unaired episode the REAL ending is better but for now MAL deems that not a part of this complete breakfas--- I MEAN series and I don’t think and unaired episode is gonna be dubbed so it won’t effect this review and my opinion of the last episode stands.Overall I found it difficult to defend this series with good points but regardless it did give me SOME enjoyment, so let’s go over the MAL categories now and rank them shall we?Story: 4/10 (by 4 I mean bad cause MALs word for it “decent” is stupid when 5 is listed as mediocre) . The story encompasses the entire series and its progression so I can’t give it points for its concept if the show ultimately lead nowhere in the end.Art: Definitely above average but nothing to flashy so I’d give it a 6/10.Sound: I’m not a great judge of this category sense I usually don’t hear the background music unless it REALLY stands out and this show definitely didn’t have anything stand out. The opening and ending aren’t bad though not great either. 5.5/10 or 6/10 in MAL terms.Characters: Honestly this one is up to the viewers’ discretion as to whether enjoy the character archetypes but I did and I saw potential that the stories progression apparently didn’t so 7.5/10 or 7/10 in MAL terms.Enjoyment: Despite its short comings it was somewhat enjoyable so I give it a 6/10.Overall: I’ve already said in the beginning my score was 5.5/10 or 6/10 in MAL terms and its hugely because the show wanted to be two different things but in the end couldn’t do either correctly enough. If it had more episodes and better writing maybe it could have been better but it didn’t so it’s sad to see this show fade but I don’t think it’s gonna be a show I’ll remember in the future and it’s not one I’d buy unless it was an essentials or a HUGELY on sale. plain lead nowhere entirely, in other words the show falls flat and it does so harder than a 40 foot belly flop. Now don't go getting upset that i just dissed your favorite anime or something cause there are positive aspects of this show to talk about, but my main issue overall is it has so much wasted potential and doesn't know how to keep tension despite acting like one of those shows where everyone is trapped in a job and suspicious of one another.The Good Aspects: The idea behind each character having to use their gaming genre of expertise to help complete tasks to reach the amount of views required to win and escape where they are at is quite an interesting concept sort of like Danganronpa without the killing aspect (of which MANY seem to blatantly compare it too…).

We know almost nothing about this guy so I guess let’s just give him a random ass reason why he’s usually alone and sleeping, that’ll work right?” I’m not saying the reason they gave him was bad per say but the resolution was completely bullshit considering NONE of the other characters really paid him all that much mind throughout the show and in the end one character just kinda “knows” the reason and he comes back because he seeing his fellow streamers are there for him or some shit? It felt forced as HELL.Many interesting elements and places they see along the way (that they can go back to ANYTIME) are just one shots that we never explore or visit again most likely due to the series only being 12 episodes and apparently a 13th none-aired episode long, but there’s so much nothing in those 12 episodes it’s sad and to see what it could have been and the its only 12 episodes point doesn’t apply to its lack of build up because other shows with less episodes had great build up like Problem Children are Coming From Another World Aren’t They? That only had 10 with an 11th bonus episode. Something that also bugged me is the quirks the streamers had like one who’s good at horror games being scare of anything remotely horror like… you were choice because you were good at playing that type of game and you can’t stand it IRL? Not just stupid and gimmicky. There’s also the nurture and farm game streamer who apparently carries around flashbang grenades? Their used for comic relief and to lower tension when people are fighting but it makes 0 sense and seems more hurtful than helpful (especially if you know what an ACTUAL flashbang can do to your ears and hearing, it’s not pretty). Also to simply note without spoilers the ending is trash. Maybe in the unaired episode the REAL ending is better but for now MAL deems that not a part of this complete breakfas--- I MEAN series and I don’t think and unaired episode is gonna be dubbed so it won’t effect this review and my opinion of the last episode stands.Overall I found it difficult to defend this series with good points but regardless it did give me SOME enjoyment, so let’s go over the MAL categories now and rank them shall we?Story: 4/10 (by 4 I mean bad cause MALs word for it “decent” is stupid when 5 is listed as mediocre) . The story encompasses the entire series and its progression so I can’t give it points for its concept if the show ultimately lead nowhere in the end.Art: Definitely above average but nothing to flashy so I’d give it a 6/10.Sound: I’m not a great judge of this category sense I usually don’t hear the background music unless it REALLY stands out and this show definitely didn’t have anything stand out. The opening and ending aren’t bad though not great either. 5.5/10 or 6/10 in MAL terms.Characters: Honestly this one is up to the viewers’ discretion as to whether enjoy the character archetypes but I did and I saw potential that the stories progression apparently didn’t so 7.5/10 or 7/10 in MAL terms.Enjoyment: Despite its short comings it was somewhat enjoyable so I give it a 6/10.Overall: I’ve already said in the beginning my score was 5.5/10 or 6/10 in MAL terms and its hugely because the show wanted to be two different things but in the end couldn’t do either correctly enough. If it had more episodes and better writing maybe it could have been better but it didn’t so it’s sad to see this show fade but I don’t think it’s gonna be a show I’ll remember in the future and it’s not one I’d buy unless it was an essentials or a HUGELY on sale."", ""Nakanohito Genome is a pretty laid back high stakes games kind of anime. How does that work, you ask? Why, just throw in lets players, a guy with an alpaca mask, and crazy challenges!The story is done pretty well. The show makes sense and doesn't take itself too seriously. Despite the fact that they've all been kidnapped and forced to participate in games, it's still a light-hearted anime for the most part. I love how they combine the mystery surrounding the games with comedy and character drama.The characters are the best thing about this anime. Well, to be specific, it's the way they interact...with each other. At times, they can be quite intriguing and, other times, they're just freaking hilarious. They aren't flat characters but they aren't well rounded either. They each have varying levels of depth and some do receive development. I really enjoyed learning about Anya and watching him change over the course of the series. Makino's development near the end was good as well. They would all benefit from having a second season though since there is room for improvement.I also loved the art for this anime. It's actually sort of refreshing to see characters with such a simple yet cute look. The animation was good too. I never saw anything that was weird or inconsistent.Both the opening and ending songs are nice to listen to. They're chill so they match what the anime itself is like most of the time. There are also a few insert songs and those sound nice as well.Story: 9Art: 9Sound: 9Character: 9Enjoyment: 10Overall, it's the ideal anime if you want a break from dark anime or if you're just trying to have a good laugh.

The characters themselves are also rather good.They are pretty unique I would say. Maybe not exactly 'unique' but they aren't cliche at all and have some certain depth to them since everyone has some kind of backstory.However.. This show gives so many 'hints' without conclusion, that you can't avoid having questions. I mentioned the characters’ backstory. But not one of their backstories is completed. There are so many puzzle pieces missing that everything just feels incomplete.So while more and more questions pop up, the...number of problems solved is 0. Maybe it was building up on the mystery genre or hyping for what comes next, but it was done pretty poorly.The show itself was good. Nothing outstanding. But the storytelling ruins that 'good'.Any mystery fans may find this enjoyable, but I think it would be better to directly start with reading the original. number of problems solved is 0.

However, they were right and wrong at the same time.–Naka no Hito Genome [Jikkyouchuu] (The Ones Within for short) tells the story of Akatsuki Iride and seven other fellow gamers who are caught by a guy (who for some reason is covers his head with an alpaca one) and are forced to play different games or else will die... figuratively, because that\'s the first problem of the series. Although throughout the series, Paka (and the anime in general) tries to make us feel worried...about the safety of the protagonists, it fails miserably. Because, although The Ones Within is supposed to be a game of life or death, there are few moments when the characters are really in danger. I mean, they are obviously in dangerous situations in almost every game, but none of these situations feels this way for the viewer too. Being a series that tries to mix mystery and comedy at the same time, it\'s not surprising that one of the genres intercepts in scenes that it shouldn\'t, and therefore the scene doesn\'t manage to create the atmosphere that it wanted (mostly, comic themes in scenes that try to be serious). Although I could give examples, I wanna try to use spoilers as few as possible.On the other hand, another serious mistake made by the adaptation is to skip all content of the manga related to the context of the kidnapping (the goal of the game\'s existence, the actions of the participants\' family after discovering their disappearance, Iride\'s past, etc.). Because of this, the anime became much simpler than the story really is, leaving in its adaptation only the games in which the characters participated and maintaining an episodic formula. Therefore, it\'s not surprising that the ending is unsatisfactory, leaving many loose ends for a second season that will probably never come (at the time I write this there is an OVA to be aired, but being an original story it doesn\'t change the anime\'s current state so much). However, not everything is mistakes in The Ones Within, only its structure.Most of the characters, however, do work for their purpose. Each of the eight gamers is a specialist in a different genre of video games, but I won\'t touch on this subject because it\'s almost never important in the anime, with small exceptions. First we have Iride, who is the main character and the worst in the octet in terms of development. Throughout the anime, a mystery unfolds about Iride\'s past and his person, which never comes to anything. Although I understand that even the source (the manga) isn\'t over, I\'m sure there are better ways to deal with a mystery of this kind that simply presenting it and hoping for people to read the manga to know the answer. Thanks to this, Iride has no evolution throughout the anime unlike the other participants. On the other hand, characters such as Onigasaki, Roromori, Oshigiri and Kudou do develop throughout history, which causes one as a spectator to become fond of them to a greater or lesser extent. Finally, we have characters like Karin, Aikawa and Paka himself, who are only ""there"" and maintain a static personality state during the course of the series.However, aside from what I have said, I must admit that the series IS indeed enjoyable. If you put aside those problems with Iride or the characters that do not advance, each episode is entertaining. In fact, although I said that the fact that we cannot feel fear for the safety of the characters is a problem, it\'s also a plus point. By this I mean that, since we know that the characters always end up safe and sound, the viewer can relax and enjoy the show for its comic side.–Although Naka no Hito Genome [Jikkyouchuu] failed to satisfy the expectations that the mystery tag entails, its charismatic cast and simple humor makes it a fun watch. about the safety of the protagonists, it fails miserably.

This is mindless fluff.Shoujo. A vital piece of information missing from MAL's description of the series. The sypnosis, first episode and overall feel of the first episode will have you expecting a dark survival anime. But fear not! This is an anime for 12 year old girls who like to sit in a circle and discuss each other's first love, play house, and literally do everything a female child considers fun.There is no sense of suspense, thrill or ANY ounce of danger in any of the episodes. Because god forbid if its scary the children might not want to watch it! If...something remotely scary ever does happen, there is always someone to kiss your boo boo. Within a few episodes you will realise that this poor excuse of an anime should have been a generic middle school rom com where a group of boys and girls discuss their emotions and feelings and live happily ever after, once they've decided their romantic pairs.The entire survival thing is bullshit. The author doesn't know how to write action or adventure. She copy pasted typical survival anime premise for episode 1, that is it, rest of it is shitty shoujo bullshit. Everything you see is a typical attribute of an inept female author. World building is a disappointment. The plot is a disappointment.

You won't laugh until your lungs hurt, but it's steady. What you get in the first few episodes is what you get for the entire series. The director doesn't force a dramatic finale and keeps it light and humorous. Overall, a good 7/10. Not stellar but worth watching.The episodes are episodic, but creative enough that you likely won't predict what will happen. The characters are decently fleshed out, though you can tell that this season did not plan to act on some of the more important reveals we see.The sound and art are a tad plain, but the humor...is focused on the characters and their interactions, so this is not a significant issue. The voicing did not particularly stand out to me except Paca-san; it sounded like his voice actor had plenty of fun with his verbal tics and puns. is focused on the characters and their interactions, so this is not a significant issue.

The good one is Danganronpa. So look elsewhere. This show just sucks.The introduction is the most cliche thing in the world. Daruma ga Koronda, Real Account, etc etc all utilize the same cheesy opening, but the difference here is that they at least had something going for them, whether it be story, characters, or setting.This anime series leaves much to desired on all of those three aspects. Like I said earlier, the characters in this show are...like second rate Danganronpa characeters. Instead of a group of ""best high school students,"" it\'s ""best gamers."" Instead of anyone interesting, you\'ve got boring ass characters that all seem like side characters. Where are the main cast? I mean, Naegi was your definition of vanilla MC, but the rest of the cast was heavenly compared to this show. First of all, they all have attached ""best at something"" role, but it basically gets never mentioned again. While that\'s not terrible, since it means that at least the show doesn\'t go down a super predictable route of ""best at x"" characters only being known for ""x,"" if you don\'t care about what they players are good at, then why add them in the first place? And don\'t talk to be about the LLama. Talk about lame compared to Monokuma. And, like a lot of anime of this genre (LIKE DANGANRONPA), there are a bunch of characters with different personalities or goals, but they get revealed extremely early because otherwise, no one would care about them, unlike Danganronpa. Another extremely weak thing about this show is the fact that the Llama forces the plot along. If not for the forced games, then there would be nothing about this show to talk about. Monokuma, while obviously a huge influencer, didn\'t ""force"" anything, per say. It\'s also fairly forced that the characters act completely different around the Llama as a result of ""forced authority and rules,"" which make any interaction with the Llama and the players to be extremely scripted and predictable. The Llama has so much influence that it\'s basically the Llama doing everything, which isn\'t exactly what you want to be doing in this sort of show.Yes, are there mysteries that I did not figure out because I dropped it at episode 4? Absolutely. Would it be worth watching. I think, most definitely not. If 4 episodes makes no splash in a pretty fast paced anime like this one, I\'d imagine that the progression of the show would make no impact of my enjoyment. I\'ll make the comparison again and again, but Danganronpa was actually interesting in the beginning, whether that be the games or the anime.The setting is pretty tame and boring. Four episodes in and no use of the setting was used at all. Stellar. While some characters are more developed (like literally two), the other characters can be described as one liners. While Dangonronpa does have this problem too, it eventually gets resolved through some more episodes. I don\'t see this one to be the case, though.As far as I can tell, this anime has no good points whatsoever. I can\'t find anything redeemable about this piece of garbage. Weak story, plot, and setting, and terrible beginning episode. What more about trash can I talk about?This is a poor man\'s version of Danganronpa, as it possesses a lot of elements that Danganronpa has. And you might be saying:""It\'s not like transported to another place and doing death games"" is directly Danganronpa. Yes, this is true, but the fact that it clashes it in the ""best of X"" people gathered around, some mascot character that\'s whimsical, the whole ""explore yourself thing except for restricted areas that are obviously going to be explored or else this show would have no point,"" and characters that try to be as good as Danganronpa\'s original cast. When you share these common points, its impossible for me to not want to compare. And oh boy, did comparing bring out the stark contrast.Don\'t waste your time on this. It\'s a heap of trash.

What I'm trying to get at is this show is...very goofy and kooky, and the characters are not far off from that too.When the show tries to present that very goofy fun tone, it is very entertaining and surprisingly funny at times, where the show does fail though, is it's tone.There are a lot of vury Saad cry tears moments that come out of nowhere and take up too much time to be a joke and the very serious moments where the show tries to remind you that these characters still have their lives on the line are just so forced and come out of nowhere sometimes.its not bad for a show to have different tones, but there needs to be at least one major tone that represent the show on a whole and I had a hard time finding out what this show was going for.Also the character backstories, the plot twist, not really a twist but like a 45 degree turn, are just stupid, forgettable, and don't matter at all.Silver Link imo is a very underrated studio, as seen from Imouto,and Yurikuma Arashi,they make some really good things despite them looking very generic, but the animation on this show is okay,so okay that I'm done talking about it. The Art style of the show is all over the place at times, sometimes there are very dark scenes, other times there are bland scenes and other times there are just very interesting shots that are colored with intrigue.The character designs look like anime character templates made by vocaloid fans though, and the backgrounds are pretty bland sometimes.Well everything, except the opening.As for the soundtrack,For some reason there are a crap ton of insert songs that don't sound too bad on their own, Some of them are made by Fhana, who is consistently good with most of her songs in my opinion.But when these insert songs pop up, they are super loud and so abrupt that any feeling you are supposed to feel at that moment is forced by the song and not by anything on screen.The score itself can be good,and other times it can be forgettable.I have to give major props to the opening which is the only thing that convinced me to actually show. It sounds really nice, the visuals are really nice, and if you pay attention,  the actual song incorporates in the main title jingle of the actual show which is pretty NEAT.The characters are…..something.I truly, honestly, whole heartedly, don't see these people as video game streamers.Unless gamers in japan yell all the time, have a plethora of flash bombs, and have severe narcolepsy.These characters are pretty much your anime cliches handed to you on a plate. For tonight’s course though, you have your nice guy, iride,the mean girl,karin, the quiet nice girl who hates when people fight,inaba, the person who yells,kudou,the other nice person who is not that nice but still nice, onigasaki,some other cool dude who has most of his personality covered with a mouth cover,oshigiri,the narcoleptic,aikawa and the weird girl,rorororororororororroroorororrororomori,.I mean they’re clique sure, but they do have chemistry with each other that is suitable for the games they play.But sometimes it feels like these people are like aliens.The way act to real life danger is way more subdued than usual that it still feels like they are playing a game on stream.And then you have the opposite side of the spectrum where the character development completely can turn a character into psychopaths, ;mainly thats the case with crazy alphaca man;  but after those moments, the show tries to treat it like it never happened, there is even one time where the traitor of the group who helped put everyone in this game confesses to one person and the person is pretty much like “kay lol” and it’s never brought upEVER AGAIN.And that’s not all folks, this show actual attempts to have character development.EMPHASIS ON “ATTEMPT”.The problem is that the development itself is so sappy and weak,from things such as dead siblings,dead parents, missing parents, kidnap siblings,dead and or missing,or kidnapped parents and or missing siblings  to other si- it’s just stupid.Now i know i ripped this show a new one, but i honestly really enjoyed it like a lot, sure the drama and characters were ugg but just watching this group of people get through these wacky games with Pacca as the dumb mascot of the show was very fun, i kinda am looking forward to season 2(because the show pretty much just stops), and this is probably one exception of a show that would benefit from laying off its overlying mystery and just become a “survival” game.Overall-6did anyone watch this show tho? very goofy and kooky, and the characters are not far off from that too.When the show tries to present that very goofy fun tone, it is very entertaining and surprisingly funny at times, where the show does fail though, is it's tone.There are a lot of vury Saad cry tears moments that come out of nowhere and take up too much time to be a joke and the very serious moments where the show tries to remind you that these characters still have their lives on the line are just so forced and come out of nowhere sometimes.its not bad for a show to have different tones, but there needs to be at least one major tone that represent the show on a whole and I had a hard time finding out what this show was going for.Also the character backstories, the plot twist, not really a twist but like a 45 degree turn, are just stupid, forgettable, and don't matter at all.Silver Link imo is a very underrated studio, as seen from Imouto,and Yurikuma Arashi,they make some really good things despite them looking very generic, but the animation on this show is okay,so okay that I'm done talking about it. The Art style of the show is all over the place at times, sometimes there are very dark scenes, other times there are bland scenes and other times there are just very interesting shots that are colored with intrigue.The character designs look like anime character templates made by vocaloid fans though, and the backgrounds are pretty bland sometimes.Well everything, except the opening.As for the soundtrack,For some reason there are a crap ton of insert songs that don't sound too bad on their own, Some of them are made by Fhana, who is consistently good with most of her songs in my opinion.But when these insert songs pop up, they are super loud and so abrupt that any feeling you are supposed to feel at that moment is forced by the song and not by anything on screen.The score itself can be good,and other times it can be forgettable.I have to give major props to the opening which is the only thing that convinced me to actually show. It sounds really nice, the visuals are really nice, and if you pay attention,  the actual song incorporates in the main title jingle of the actual show which is pretty NEAT.The characters are…..something.I truly, honestly, whole heartedly, don't see these people as video game streamers.Unless gamers in japan yell all the time, have a plethora of flash bombs, and have severe narcolepsy.These characters are pretty much your anime cliches handed to you on a plate.

As far as the story goes, its Sword Art Online but but with leas people trapped, more focus on other characters, and comedy, a whole lot of comedy. I terms of story, its ok kind of. Fun and interesting cast with diverse personalities and backgrounds, its good if you are in mood for some mindless fun.

It gives me Danganronpa vibes and that I love, that I cherish, and that I adore. Though, let me start with what I dislike first.I will start with this - the main problem that I had with this anime was the fact it tried to act serious but failed at remaining serious. What I mean by this is that at the very beginning, the antagonist tells the main characters about the 'serious' consequences if they do this, this or that. Basically, the characters' lives are threatened in a way and it is assumed that not following the rules will result in...possible death or they will receive some high level punishments but then when some of the characters actually broke the rules or did something that they were not supposed to do, or did something that angered the villain, absolutely nothing bad happened to them.They were simply left off the hook and that happened every single time.I don't want to spoil or anything but at one point, one of the characters will get 'punished' for his attitude but let's be real, this was not much of a punishment. At the start, the punishment was portrayed like if it was going to put the character like in some sort of high psychological mental crisis or something. This got me interested, this got me hooked, it made me feel scared for the characters, I feared for what could badly happen to them but then when the thing happened, the character handled himself just fine, the punishment was NO big deal at all and that was so frustrating.I really, really disliked that aspect of acting serious but not actually being serious. It brought me so much annoyance and frustration.Like, don't get me wrong, I don't want to see the characters dead or hurt or something like that but come on, the anime proposed to you a story that will put characters in an unpleasant and undesired position. They are being forced to participate in games, they are going to face bad situations and sometimes you really need bad stuff to happen to make you really connect with a story (especially the sort of story that is supposed to be Nakanohito Genome), to make you really feel for a character. Though, now whenever there is some sort of threat to the characters' lives, I just know that it is going to be no big deal, that the characters are going to be just fine in the end.There are no deadly consequences so just do whatever everyone.I just wished that this was handle in a different way. Again, the fact that there are no deadly consequences is not a problem to me, I'm not searching for this but the anime made it seem like death was one possible outcome, that bad things could happen but when it was finally time for the bad stuff to become reality, it was just brushed off or put aside.NOWDespite all that I said above, I really love this anime. I enjoyed the interaction between the characters, the dialogues and seriously, I really laughed a lot at some moments. I started watching this anime with no real expectations and after the first episode ended, I wasn't sure if I was going to like this story or not but in the end, I really enjoyed it. The story has a level of mystery and you just want to know more about the secrets hidden at every corner. Even some of the characters seem to have some important secrets hidden and this got me more than interested.I don't really remember but the episode (I think that it was episode 8 but I am not really sure) with the game with the 3 maids, I love it to the core. BEST EPISODE for me.If a season 2 comes out, I will definitely watch it and despite my first complain above, overall I enjoyed it. possible death or they will receive some high level punishments but then when some of the characters actually broke the rules or did something that they were not supposed to do, or did something that angered the villain, absolutely nothing bad happened to them.They were simply left off the hook and that happened every single time.I don't want to spoil or anything but at one point, one of the characters will get 'punished' for his attitude but let's be real, this was not much of a punishment.

( will touch on this later in the review. )Story- 6/10 Where to begin? Well, for one, I enjoyed the story it showed, while I do believe much more could have been done, it was not horrid nor unbearable. Now that's not my baseline for enjoying it, but just as a heads up, it is not the most amazing story. While parts are predictable and not too unique at times, the overall feel is pretty ok.To give an idea without saying much- there are...a lot of chances for the anime to make it more exciting but just don't it's average. It's not bad per se but again definitely could be better.The anime, in particular, failed compared to the manga, however, in the fact that it cut out so much more that would improve and help the actual story and plot. Now I won't spoil much but let me just say, the anime is missing out on a lot, as in a whole other POV and characters that would clear a lot up.I will say I did find the beginning to be interesting, not overly interesting but enough so I continued and decided I wanted to read the manga. As we continue through the anime it didn't really wavier or raise until the last few episodes, and even then the interest was there but not so much the excitement.Not fuller serious either, quite lighthearted for the situation they are in. but that's part of the appeal/enjoyment of watching it.Art 7/10- simply liked the art and style. It was nice and the designs were good. The animation was ok, standard nothing special about it.Sound -4/10  not that memorable, honestly don't remember it.Characters 6/10- Overall the anime doesn't cover all of the characters to the best degree, I will say though that we at least get to see each character and their actions decently enough throughout the actual anime. Although I do believe some more so than others it isn't horribly done. The group isn't focused on 100% of the time as a whole and we do get to see character interaction as well which I quite enjoyed.I do like how each character specializes in different types of games in which will come in handy when needed throughout the anime.Enjoyment 7/10- I actually quite enjoyed the whole anime, not one I would actively think about or jump to talk about however I can defiantly see that some people would enjoy it highly. It was simply nothing too big but enough so that I watched it through and am waiting for a season 2.Overall 6/10-OK so the rate isn't too high but I think that it's fair. I would suggest this if you don't know what to watch, you might just like it for its calm/comedic way of going through something of an emergency. Is it amazing and outstanding, no. Not really. But is it so bad I wouldn't recommend it? Nah, not that either. I'd watch it if it interests you or if you have the time to. You aren't missing anything if you skip it.

The characters each had very unique personalities and backstories (which were all depressing, but what do we expect?).

Afterwards, Athena & the Bronze Saints rendezvous in Asgard where the God Warriors reside in. While it does have similar concepts of the much later Asgard filler arc, the stories & characters are vastly different. In this feature, the God Warriors simply wish for divine conquest & not much of their character are explored with the exception of Frey who could've been the...primary focus of the movie due to certain Norse mythology.In terms of visuals, The Heated Battle of Gods maintains the same creativity as the Eris film while placing more emphasis on the characters' hair as various scenes depict strong winds in combat. Another visual feature is Dolbar's Odin Shield which causes the background to change color on a repetitive basis but pleasing to the eyes.One of the stylish choices of Saint Seiya is the usage of projectile based fighting, however the film decided to go with more physical hand-to- hand combat. Much of the fight scenes benefited from this use but sadly contains the same flaws as the first movie; the battles ending very quickly. While there  was a movie highlight being a fight between Hyoga & Shiryu, it leaves fans wanting for more. One of the benefits of this movie is the villain Dolbar who actually battles in this movie who unlike Eris in her film didn't display any intimidating prowess.

(Or read... yea, read is better).This is the second Saint Seiya movie: The Heated War of the Gods. This one is loosely based in a side story published in the 13 manga volume: Nastassja from the Land of Ice (the Asgard saga is based on this too, obviously).Story: something wrong is happening in the north, and since Hyoga is the only one who works fine in the snow, he try to investigate. Since he doesn't come back, Athena and her Saints start to worry, and finally decide to find him. In Asgard, Dolbar, Valhalla...leader, told the saints that he has no idea where the heck Hyoga is, but he will send a search party. Of course, that's just a lot of crap, and Dolbar promptly kidnap Athena with the intention of takeover not only Asgard, but the Sanctuary as well. So, Seiya, Shiryu and Shun (Ikki will come mid-movie) will fight the god warriors: Loki (Megrez Alberich look alike), Ull (waaaaaaaaay similar to Aliotho Phenril), Rung (Phecta Tholl's prototype, apparently) and Midgar (he kinda reminds me Merak Hagen), not only for saving Athena this time, but to find were the hell is the Cygnus saint.Animation: Like the TV series. This was made back in 87, so if you are used only to new stuff, you may think is old and primitive (or, in a more polite way, classic). If you started back in the 80/90, then is pretty good. Back then, it was f*cking awesome.Sound: The music is epic, as always. The voices... well, since you are reading the engrish version of this review, that means you aren't from Latin America or Spain. I assume that you are going to watch the japanese dub. It's pretty awesome, you may know the seiyūs from the Hades: Chapter Santuary (In Inferno and Elysion Toei change all the voices). Soooo, good voice acting.Verdict: the movie is fine, but it resemble the Asgard saga too much. Or, Asgard saga resemble this movie a lot (since it came first)... whatever, is a bit redundant (more than usual, actually). But the plot is better set than in the Eris movie (plus, Athena is not the only source of problems here, which is kinda refreshing). The fights are well done, but there isn't a lot of time to make them fluid or more... complex, let’s say.So, all in all, if you liked Saint Seiya, this movie will entertain (the third one is way better, though).--------Buenas!Esta es la segunda película de Saint Seiya: La Batalla de los dioses. Esta ligeramente basada en una historia aparte que se publico en el tomo 13 del manga: Natassia en el país de los hielos (de acá también salió, obviamente, la saga de Asgard).Historia: algo raro anda pasado en el norte, y como Hyoga es el único que se maneja bien en la nieve, va a investigar. Como no vuelve, Athena y sus santos empiezan a preocuparse, y terminan yendo a buscarlo. Ya en Asgard, Dolbar, el líder del Valhalla, le dice a los caballeros que no tiene ni idea de quién es Hyoga, pero que se queden a pasar la noche, mientras el manda gente a buscarlo. Por supuesto, esto es una trampa, y Dolbar captura a Athena con las obvias intenciones de dominar tanto Asgard como el Santuario. De esta forma, Seiya, Shiryu y Shun (Ikki llega más tarde) deben enfrentarse a los dioses guerreros: Loki (tiene un aire a Alberich de Megrez), Ull (muuuuuy parecido a Phenril de Aliotho), Rung (parecido a Tholl de Phecta) y Midgar (me recuerda a Hagen de Merak), al mismo tiempo que intentan averiguar donde se metió el caballero del Cisne.Animación: La misma de la serie. Tengamos en cuenta que esto fue en el 88, por lo que si uno está acostumbrado a lo actual, por supuesto que Saint Seiya puede parecer primitivo, o al menos, “clásica”. Para los que arrancamos en los 90, la animación es muy buena, correcta, y todo eso (COPIADO DE MI REVIEW DE LA PELICULA DE ERIS... que quieren, técnicamente es igual).Sonido: La música, épica, como siempre. En cuanto a las voces, depende de la versión que viste: la versión española es correcta para los españoles, supongo. Pero el consenso americano general es que las voces de España apestan. Después, esta la versión remasterizada mexicana, en la que Jesús Barrero y compañía están presentes :D. O al menos, los caballeros de bronce, con la excepción de Shiryu (la vos de Shun puede sonar distinta, pero es el original... solo que con más años. Los más jóvenes tal vez lo reconozcan por su trabajo como Neji Hyuga). Los actores de doblaje hacen un trabajo notable, y la calidad de sonido es muy buena (COPIADO DE MI REVIEW DE LA PELICULA DE ERIS... lo mismo que con la animación, de una película a otra no varía).Veredicto: La película no está mal, pero se parece demasiado a la Saga de Asgard. O mejor dicho, la saga de Asgard se parece mucho a esta película... Como sea, tiende a ser un poco más redundante de lo habitual. Sin embargo, la trama me parece mejor planteada que en la película de Eris (y que Athena no sea la única fuente de problemas es muy original en esta serie). De nuevo, las peleas está bien hechas, pero hay muy poco tiempo como para que la acción se desarrolle. En resumen, si te gusta Saint Seiya, La Batalla de los dioses va a entretenerte. leader, told the saints that he has no idea where the heck Hyoga is, but he will send a search party. Of course, that's just a lot of crap, and Dolbar promptly kidnap Athena with the intention of takeover not only Asgard, but the Sanctuary as well. So, Seiya, Shiryu and Shun (Ikki will come mid-movie) will fight the god warriors: Loki (Megrez Alberich look alike), Ull (waaaaaaaaay similar to Aliotho Phenril), Rung (Phecta Tholl's prototype, apparently) and Midgar (he kinda reminds me Merak Hagen), not only for saving Athena this time, but to find were the hell is the Cygnus saint.Animation: Like the TV series. This was made back in 87, so if you are used only to new stuff, you may think is old and primitive (or, in a more polite way, classic). If you started back in the 80/90, then is pretty good. Back then, it was f*cking awesome.Sound: The music is epic, as always. The voices... well, since you are reading the engrish version of this review, that means you aren't from Latin America or Spain. I assume that you are going to watch the japanese dub. It's pretty awesome, you may know the seiyūs from the Hades: Chapter Santuary (In Inferno and Elysion Toei change all the voices). Soooo, good voice acting.Verdict: the movie is fine, but it resemble the Asgard saga too much. Or, Asgard saga resemble this movie a lot (since it came first)... whatever, is a bit redundant (more than usual, actually). But the plot is better set than in the Eris movie (plus, Athena is not the only source of problems here, which is kinda refreshing). The fights are well done, but there isn't a lot of time to make them fluid or more... complex, let’s say.So, all in all, if you liked Saint Seiya, this movie will entertain (the third one is way better, though).--------Buenas!Esta es la segunda película de Saint Seiya: La Batalla de los dioses. Esta ligeramente basada en una historia aparte que se publico en el tomo 13 del manga: Natassia en el país de los hielos (de acá también salió, obviamente, la saga de Asgard).Historia: algo raro anda pasado en el norte, y como Hyoga es el único que se maneja bien en la nieve, va a investigar. Como no vuelve, Athena y sus santos empiezan a preocuparse, y terminan yendo a buscarlo. Ya en Asgard, Dolbar, el líder del Valhalla, le dice a los caballeros que no tiene ni idea de quién es Hyoga, pero que se queden a pasar la noche, mientras el manda gente a buscarlo. Por supuesto, esto es una trampa, y Dolbar captura a Athena con las obvias intenciones de dominar tanto Asgard como el Santuario. De esta forma, Seiya, Shiryu y Shun (Ikki llega más tarde) deben enfrentarse a los dioses guerreros: Loki (tiene un aire a Alberich de Megrez), Ull (muuuuuy parecido a Phenril de Aliotho), Rung (parecido a Tholl de Phecta) y Midgar (me recuerda a Hagen de Merak), al mismo tiempo que intentan averiguar donde se metió el caballero del Cisne.Animación: La misma de la serie.

What makes this film even worse in its execution of an oversimplified version of the main series' common structure is has to do...with its main villain, his henchmen and the method in which Athena is incapacitated. Whereas Eris' portrayal in the previous film hearkened back to her depiction in mythology, Drbal being an evil Odin is not only inaccurate to the mythology, but makes him a very one-dimensional and stupid character (if he was strong enough to overpower Athena, why even bother with all the secrecy?). His henchmen are all very one-note or lacking in characterisation as well and serve as no more than punching bags for the Bronze Saints, and very soft punching bags at that when this was created during the time the 12 Zodiac Palaces battle was ongoing in the anime and presumably set after it commenced (given Athena's Saints being referred to as those of Sanctuary), yet none of the God Warriors required the Saints to use the Seventh Sense and even Drbal wasn't treat as an overwhelming threat to a Gold Saint.The redeeming elements of this film, beyond the great art as with the first, would be Frey's actions in actively opposing Drbal's actions despite his affiliation with Asgard adding a bit more to character motivations than most of the other films did. On the subject of characters and Asgard, however, this further devalues the film as what potential to be found within its premise was executed to a far greater degree with the anime's Asgard Arc which makes this film absolutely redundant.Overall, there's no need to waste time with this one beyond seeing some of its nice art and animation when its paper thin plot and characters were remade into something far better and even the later films' shared continuity completely ignores it. Easily the worst of the original 4 Saint Seiya films. with its main villain, his henchmen and the method in which Athena is incapacitated.

Shin Tenchi Muyou!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/538/Shin_Tenchi_Muyou,"[""As one of the less popular Tenchi series, I felt like I should try and even out the opinions a little.STORY - I'll admit it. The first time I saw this series, I hated it too. But I rewatched the whole thing more recently and found that it actually wasn't as bad as I remembered. Like the Tenchi Forever movie, I think most fans were indignant at the introduction of a &quot;Mary Sue&quot; character and consequently abhorred the entire series. But while yes, Sakuya was more or less an &quot;intruder&quot; character to our good ol' harem, she forces a very interesting situation onto the rest...of the girls. After two whole other series of being fought over by the crazy women he lives with, Tenchi finally moves out and finds someone on his own. Come on now, isn't that an intriguing twist to the premise of the Tenchi saga?It isn't even as if Ryoko, Ayeka, and the rest disappear altogether and are unimportant; rather the opposite is true. With a puppeteer orchestrating everything in the background, it gradually warps into a grand epic as they once again find themselves needing to save the world, not to mention Tenchi. I, for one, found it incredibly interesting to watch see the girls struggle with life without Tenchi, especially as they were faced with jealousy, spite, and general unhappiness at their &quot;replacement&quot; by Sakuya. And in the end, as everything twisted into a crazy supernatural plot... well, with so much emotional drama going on, I suppose we needed something to remind us about that other kickass blowing-stuff-up part of Tenchi.CHARACTER - Honestly, I think the characters' depths are explored much more in Tenchi in Tokyo than in any other Tenchi, and this completely due to the fact that Sakuya exists. For once, you're able to see Tenchi as more than just an awkward shrine boy who doesn't know what to do about anything -- he becomes more human as he's allowed to interact with people that aren't aliens or freaks of science, and that makes him a much more convincing and three-dimensional character. Because of his feelings for Sakuya, his feelings for the others, especially Ryoko and Ayeka, become more clear and he's finally able to put things in a more concrete perspective. It's actually very refreshing to see him come so far when he originally wasn't very interesting at all.Ryoko and Ayeka, as the ones most affected by the loss of Tenchi, both show fantastic character development throughout the course of the series. Their feelings, the anger, jealousy, and hurt, are very real and easy to sympathize with, and their subsequent actions expose the many flaws in their personalities which further their complexities as characters. Of course, this forces their overall characters to be a bit different from their previous incarnations, but I don't find it to be an unwelcomed change. The rest of the girls aren't as affected and consequently don't seem to stray much from the typical character molds cast for them originally.Now, Sakuya... Sakuya is an interesting character if only because of the fact that she isn't really real. Her validity of her personality and feelings are really up to debate though, especially since she does declare herself to be real and not a puppet. In the end, I'm not really happy with the character Yugi is revealed to be; it seemed like a cheap way out of something that had built itself up to be so epic, but I guess everything can't be perfect.ARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - I believe one of the other big complaints about Tenchi in Tokyo was that its art style was vastly different from the previous two series. It does take some getting used to, but I don't really think it's that intolerable in the end. The style is rounder and more feathered along the edges, so some people claim it to be a &quot;lazier&quot; style. It makes for some strangely stylized portrayals, but it isn't as if any of the characters are twisted out of all possible forms of recognition. And it's definitely not awful by any means.MUSIC - A little lacking in this department, the music isn't nearly as good as it had been in previous series. It's mostly generic sounding, which means the background music always suits its scenes, but nothing really stands out. The OP/ED are quite awesome though, considering that both &quot;Yume wa doko e itta?&quot; and &quot;Yamerarenai Yamerarenai&quot; are sung by the voice actors, which is always fun.VOICE ACTING - I've seen this both dubbed and subbed. I've always considered the Tenchi series to be one of the better early dubs, back in the days of Toonami. Ryoko and Ayeka especially had voices that suited their characters very well (though for Ryoko, I'll always be partial to her Japanese voice because it's Ai Orikasa). Tenchi's English voice I was never really fond of, but it still suited his character well enough. And the rest of the cast is very much the same in that respect.OVERALL - Tenchi in Tokyo really deserves more credit. It threw a wrench in the great harem premise and allowed for some fantastic emotional drama. The supernatural side got a little predictable from time to time, but I don't really feel like that was the most important part of the series. It was great watching Ryoko and Ayeka beat themselves around the head trying to deal with the loss of Tenchi to another girl, and if you're a great, big, sadistic fan of character ANGST like me, then I think you'd like this series. :3 of the girls.

But believe me when I say that this attempt was ill fated from the start. I just couldnt get into the story. I guess it had something to do with the main cast splitting up for the majority of the series- which I hated. The best part of Tenchi is the characters and the romantic conflicts that erupt between them. When Yugi was introduced I immediately began to dread what I knew was coming. This was going to suck. And it did. Maybe not completely but certainly for the most part. Yugi looked like she had a...bucket of boardwalk fries on her head. Not only that the odd relationship with her and Sasami was...disturbing to say the least. Ryoko is by far my favorite character in this series :) and even she had a difficult time keeping my attention. If youre a fan of romantic comedies like Ranma or any of the other Tenchi shows definately check this one out. Just dont expect anything life changing. bucket of boardwalk fries on her head.

As a fan of the original ova's, Tenchi in Tokyo has made me wish i had never even watched them and gotten hooked on the tenchi series' to begin with.However, if you enjoy the Tenchi-Muyo series simplyfor its pure silliness then you will definitely like this anime. I would say it's only slightly more intelligent than 'Ninja Nonsense'....So if you like that stuff, then this is the series for you. So if you like that stuff, then this is the series for you."", ""(Re-posting due to cleaning up some of my thoughts and correcting some spelling mistakes)Story: (3) The problem with Tenchi In Tokyo starts with the plot.  The creators of this story came up with this neat concept of Tenchi living in Tokyo as a shrine boy, but failed to bring the most important aspect of the show with them... the girls.  Instead they create this vapid girl who doesn't have a personality to take the place of the girls left at home.  The charm of the Tenchi series is the fact that Tenchi loves all of these girls unconditionally and surrounds himself with...family due to the pain of losing his mother early in his life, so the plot device that he leaves them all behind and falls for another girl entirely, doesn't work out.  Canon Tenchi would never do this, he knows choosing a girl would hurt the others in the house and do you not believe for a second that Washu would not be able to create some portals to make the living space cozy for all?  Come on now!Art: (5) The art seemed okay, but it wasn't up to par with the other Tenchi series.  There was a ton of deformed art and towards the end it was riddled with lazy animation made to fill up the episode.  Some of the character designs didn't look right.Sound: (7) The sound was good.  Nobodies voice got annoying with the exception for Yugi's.  The only bone I have to pick is the lead background sound track.  It became very repetitive and obnoxious after awhile.Character: (3) Next to the plot this is another pitfall the series had.  The characters were decimated in this.  The girls were dumbed down to argue and fight among themselves more then usual.  Everyone became almost of character of themselves.  The most notable were Tenchi and Washu, but everyone's character pretty much got spanked.  Tenchi turned into a loner of a character who almost just wanted to be left alone all the time, snapping off at anyone who bothered him.  He became downright blasphemous to the original series, seemingly uncaring about the girls feelings towards him, downright scolding them at times for even visiting him, refusing to even spend time with them.  Washu, who is usually the voice of reason and usually the helping hand, became even sillier then she was in Universe.  Her main shtick became creating inventions only for them to backfire and blow up in her face.  And the rest of the girls could not even hold part time jobs/attend normal public functions without ruining something, something their counterparts could actually do until Ryoko or Mihoshi found some way to mess it up.  Then there is Sakuya and Yugi.  Two characters you just wish the series never introduced.  The problem with Sakuya is her constant stalking of Tenchi, making him feel bad for not originally returning her feelings, and constantly demanding he forget about his family in favor of her.  Why?  This doesn't make sense.  He's known her all of a week or two when she is first heavily put into the story.  He has known the girls for two years according to show canon.  And another problem with Tenchi is he actually eventually listens to her, something that is STILL baffling to me.  The problem with Yugi is the constant villain shoving we get with her.  If Yugi isn't shown at least three times an episode, you aren't watching Tenchi In Tokyo.Enjoyment: (5) With that said, there was some aspects of this story that were Tenchi like and that I enjoyed, but it didn't make up for how poor this story was.  I would almost say this is a dark comedy, because some parts with the girls are hilarious, but at the original characters expense.  I would also say this series could have possibly been shortened to 12 episodes to clean the plot up more, 26 seemed to be milking the series a bit to much.Overall: (5) I was going to give this series a 4, but there was SOME redeeming factors, just not many.  I would only recommend this story as something to watch if you have an open mind and are looking for more Tenchi after watching the OVA's and Universe, but be mindful because some aspects of this series can be very infuriating at times.  Watch/rewatch the Tenchi OVA's and Universe first.  Those are the best in my opinion. family due to the pain of losing his mother early in his life, so the plot device that he leaves them all behind and falls for another girl entirely, doesn't work out.

I would also say this series could have possibly been shortened to 12 episodes to clean the plot up more, 26 seemed to be milking the series a bit to much.Overall: (5) I was going to give this series a 4, but there was SOME redeeming factors, just not many.  I would only recommend this story as something to watch if you have an open mind and are looking for more Tenchi after watching the OVA's and Universe, but be mindful because some aspects of this series can be very infuriating at times.  Watch/rewatch the Tenchi OVA's and Universe first.  Those are the best in my opinion.""]"
