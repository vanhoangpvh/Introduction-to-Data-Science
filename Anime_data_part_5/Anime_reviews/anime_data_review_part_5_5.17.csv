Qian Cong Shou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50441/Qian_Cong_Shou,"['This was a pretty good donghua, one that I hope gets more attention and a second season.The action sequences are definitely the greatest strong-point of this show, they were very fast-paced and exciting. For this reason I\'d highly recommend people give this show at least 2 episodes before deciding whether to continue or not, as the action sequence in episode 2 is very good. The ""Power Word"" magic system used by the characters in the series features some interesting super powers, but more than that the main character Qiancong really makes the fights interesting with how he uses his own cunning to make up for...his (initial) lack of a Power Word ability.The CGI character animation may initially be off-putting to some, but I think it works well for the show. The CGI character animation allows for much more fluid movement, making the fight scenes much better. Furthermore, the animators tried make the character models look as close to 2D as possible, through the use of cel shading. Overall, this show is a fairly good example Chinese CGI used well. The music was also always pleasant to listen to.The cast of characters were decent for the most part. Some of the secondary characters were goofy or unremarkable, but the main two leads were pretty good, particularly the main character Qiancong. I enjoyed Qiancong\'s crafty style of fighting, I always appreciate shows where the protagonist relies on strategy over simply having the more overpowered ability. When he does eventually unlock his own Power Word ability, it is definitely the most interesting ability in the show. Furthermore, Qiancong is a very headstrong and passionate protagonist, I found it easy to root for him.My main problem with the story is that the show never clearly defines what the ""Qiancong Guardians"" are. From the context clues it\'s apparent they are some sort of peace-keeping organization, but beyond that little is explained about how their organization works or what their role in the world is. The story revolves around this organization and our group of protagonists trying to become members of it, so this was a significant issue I had throughout the story. For a comparison, it\'s kind of like watching Naruto or Bleach, but if the stories never explained what the purpose of the Shinobi or Soul Hunters are. his (initial) lack of a Power Word ability.The CGI character animation may initially be off-putting to some, but I think it works well for the show.

Sakura Taisen: Ouka Kenran,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1165/Sakura_Taisen__Ouka_Kenran,"['If you ask any anime fan these days what the most popular franchise is (and by that I mean not simply anime and manga, but also games, figures, costumes, etc), then you\'ll probably be answered with something like Full Metal Alchemist, Bleach, Naruto, Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell, etc, etc. However, this was not always the case.Back in 1996 a phenomenon occured in the console games market. Making a game that had anime style graphics wasn\'t a new thing at the time, and the trend has continued to this day. No, the phenomenon wasn\'t based on how the game looked, it was based on the...fact that, for the first time, there was a game that blended several popular elements into one new and shiny whole. The game in question mixed tactical wargaming with dating simulator, samurais with steampunk, theatre with demon hunting.That game was the first in the Sakura Taisen series.Released by Sega for their Saturn console, the game enjoyed immediate success, and the re-release for the Dreamcast only served to cement it\'s place in the gaming world. It\'s success was such that in the year it was originally released only one game was considered better - Final Fantasy VII. Since then the game has placed #13 in Famitsu\'s Top 100 Games of all time, with the following three games also taking places within the top 100. Sakura Taisen V was the best selling game in Japan in 2005, and the latest installment has become the most wanted game of 2009.So with all this success and popularity, where are the reviews of the series? There aren\'t any, so is it really that good?The anime (OVA), version, released in 1997, follows the formation of the Imperial Assault Force - Flower Division, a group of young women with high spiritual energy who work on the front line, defending the city of Tokyo from attack by demons. These women work by day as actresses and singers in Imperial Grand Theater, beneath which is their base of operations and the place where they store the tools of their real trade - the dual powered steam/spirit armour developed by Kanzaki Heavy Industries.Okay, the premise doesn\'t sound too bad and, to be honest, the whole story is pretty decent (and a damn sight better than much of what\'s around today). The plot is reasonably well paced, especially because this is an OVA, however it can feel like it drags from time to time. One nice thing about the show is that rather than simply lifting straight from the game, the anime is actually set within it\'s timeframe (the last epsiode takes place around the middle of the game), so watching the series only enhances the gaming experience (unlike a lot of game tie-ins).One of the things that originally set the series apart was the fact that it wasn\'t just a supernatural series, but that it was also one of the early attempts to include steampunk in anime. This set it apart from almost every other sci-fi series of the time, and even now there are still only a few anime that fall into that category (Steamboy being a recent example). The mecha designs were taken straight from the game, with a few minor revisions, but the essence of the game remains within the OVA. The characters from the game are also directly transferred to the anime, again with a few minor revisions. Now, one would think that this would hinder the design aspect in certain ways, but the fact is that the original game was well thought out and designed from the start. This meant that the character designs were pretty decent to begin with, thus making any ""tweaks"" easier to do.Animation is good for the entire series. The game featured very little actual animation (compared to modern games), but the animators took their cues from that reference material, as well as their own experience. The characters and mechs move in a free manner that is great to see, but there are occurrences of unnatural body positions and sometimes overly ""clunky"" mech combat. The backgrounds are colourful and nicely detailed and, as with the costumes, are highly reflective of the alternate 1920s setting.The voice actors are a bit of a sticking point with me, in particular, the English cast. The Japanese dub had a certain ""je ne sais qua"" that made the comedy work and added some weight to the more serious scenes. The English dub, on the other hand, was a complete failure as far as I\'m concerned. The English cast, while being pretty good in terms of acting ability, managed to really ham up the show. Many of the scenes in the English dub suffer from wooden or over acting, all the while maintaining a distinctly juvenile attitude.The unfortunate thing about this is that by the time the OVA was released inthe West, we already knew that anime could not only be dubbed well, but that it could actually be made into something better and more accessible to us. The Western reception ofthe OVA was far from favourable because of the dub.Musically the series is actually pretty good. The fact that the show is based around a theatre troupe adds a whole new dimension to the musical possibilities, and those that were chosen for the OVA are well used and often add some depth to the scene. The effects follow much the same pattern as the music, with many being well suited to their purpose, again enhancing the atmosphere of the show.Characters for the OVA are a big plus, but also a big minus as well. The characters are individuals in almost every sense, however they are also stereotypical in many repects. This isn\'t a bad thing as many shows have used stereotypical characters and still turned out to be good. The problem here is that this is an OVA so there is no room to become involved with the characters, so they feel shallow and underdeveloped. On the positive side though, the mass appeal of the game meant that most of the people who originally watched the OVA were already familiar with the characters, something which the producers were hoping for.As a slight aside, I\'m going to touch on an issue that should be raised. Because the OVA ties in directly with the game there should be no need to devlop the characters over the course of the anime. That said, no one actually expected the franchise to be as popular as it is (yes, it\'s still one of the most popular anime and gaming franchises), but this is only within Japan. Most viewers outside of Japan will have little knowledge of the game or it\'s impact, and this means that they will watch the OVA without any background information. When viewed from this perspective, the flaws with the OVA are exacerbated, and most viewers may find the series unsatisfying.However, if you\'re a Dreamcast owner then there\'s a good chance that you\'ll have at least heard of the series. Likewise fans of the games for both the Saturn and the Dreamcast will need no introduction to it.Sakura Taisen presents me with something of a quandary. The obvious flaws with the scripting of the OVA preclude the unfamiliar from fully appreciating the series, yet it is still a good introduction to the franchise. The fact that it\'s a game tie in should prevent it from having a decent plot, story and design, yet it does. The English dub makes you want to scream, but the Japanese dub has you paying attention. The OVA has so many contradictions that at times it seems a bit unfair.It\'s not easy to recommend this to any but the hardcore mech fans and Sakura Taisen junkies, yet I will. Although the series has it\'s problems, it also has action and drama, and in these two areas Skaura Taisen is up there with the best of that year. Unfortunately the cons outweigh the pro\'s in this series, something which is only really forgivable and less relevant if you have played the games.In the end it\'s up to you if you want to watch this, but if you do then you should remember that this OVA only really tells half of the story.And for those of you who are wondering about the score, I\'ve based it on knowing the game rather than the other way around. If I had no knowledge of the series, then the score would be slightly lower. fact that, for the first time, there was a game that blended several popular elements into one new and shiny whole.

Saki Biyori Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/27709/Saki_Biyori_Animation,"['Welcome Saki fans – or just anyone who’s like me and prefers to leave no stone unturned as far as OVAs and special eps. I’m here to report that the Saki Biyori OVA is actually alright. The art style is not really chibi, but a simplified style compared to the main show. It does not feel cheap either, as there is actually a little bit of character animation in here. It’s shallow like you would expect from a 4koma spinoff, and the jokes are mostly “meh”, but the last segment with Ryuumonbuchi is pretty good. Stay for the ending credits and final scene. ']"
Saber Marionette R,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1232/Saber_Marionette_R,"[""This part of the series actually takes place several years after the events of Saber Marionette J to X.The three main characters in this part of the series still maintain the same names, but are completely new models. Lime is now more childish looking with brown hair; Cherry as well looks like a kid, and has red hair (she still has pretty much the same attitude though); Bloodberry looks like she's in her teens again, but has black (a.k.a. dark blue) hair and a more mature look and personality.While I am a huge fan of the other parts of the Saber Marionette series, even I...have to say that this one seems to be the best out of all of them. Maybe it's due to how the story is told, or maybe it's due to the fact that the animation style fits the new surroundings, which are more western.This part of the series often gets overlooked due to how old it is, which is a real shame with how good the story is. The story itself was actually an old raido show that was broadcast in Japan many years before the J saga came along, which ended up getting animated (thus the reason for the R saga only being a few episodes long).In the end, this saga has a different feel than the other parts of the Saber Marionette series, and may not be liked by everyone. But I suggest that you give this short OVA a shot if you find it. have to say that this one seems to be the best out of all of them.

But I suggest that you give this short OVA a shot if you find it."", ""So, having seen the rest of the Saber Marionette franchise, I had a pretty good idea of what to expect. Mediocre animation, bad jokes, cartoonish villains, a campy yet surprisingly poignant storyline and cast, and heaps of “love will save the world” sentiment. In other words, a good kids show. Boy was I *completely* wrong about that. Instead, what we have is a dark and haunting hollywoodesque thriller with superb camerawork and animation, which in addition to “love vs hate” overlays the theme of innocence vs sexual depravity. The fights are way more intense than the fights in the cousins to this OVA; unlike in...J, J again, or J to X, each fight is a fight to the death, desperate and gripping. Due to the way the characters are animated, a simple thing like a punch to the stomach actually looks really painful, inflicted wounds are something that causes the viewer to wince. In general, I couldn't get enough of the artwork, the animation, the body movements, even the facial expressions. The way this was paced also adds a sense of urgency to the affair. There is not a wasted second in this OVA.With all this to brag about, there is one fatal flaw to the whole affair. It is, in the big picture, utterly generic. It has nothing all that interesting to say in terms of plot. Going with my hollywood comparison, it favors style over substance. And quite frankly, that has to be the fault of the original story, those who worked on this adaption are not at fault. As far as adaptations go, I would say this adaption is a 9/10 adaption of 6/10 material. Thus, we have a high 7/10, halfway between good and great. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a mature and quality take on the Saber Marionette concept. J, J again, or J to X, each fight is a fight to the death, desperate and gripping.

At this point I'm just giving anything a chance, even if it's loli-robots. And I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that, compared to the other Saber Marionette entries, this is actually rated R.Art and animation are simply amazing, truly one of the best looking examples of this era's style. Although I have to admit that the 4 main characters look kinda weird compared to everyone else, mostly because of their silly disproportionate eyes. Story was... whatever. The ending was sadly...anticlimactic.Overall it was a really strange and surprising experience. Very entertaining and satisfying to watch. Maybe giving it an 8 is too much considering the unassuming story, but I praise the amount of work and effort that was put by the adaptation team. anticlimactic.Overall it was a really strange and surprising experience.

Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35298/Ramen_Daisuki_Koizumi-san,"['I love CGDCT. It\'s one of my favorite genres and provides a fun, happy viewing experience. Whether it be one that does a lot to make the characters stand out and relate their personal struggles while also keeping it fun, or whether it be one that diverts away from more developmental aspects just to have fun I find the genre to be rewarding to watch. There are even some CGDCT that do very little outside of the bare minimum that are still fun to watch due to the joy that I get from watching cute friends being friendly with each other.I state this for a...reason. Sometimes in reviews you get people who don\'t like the genre coming in and trashing a show that was never made to appeal to their interests. That isn\'t the case here. I really enjoy CGDCT, and even a bad one can have moments worth watching.Or so I thought. Because Ramen Daisuki is completely lacking in anything that makes it worth watching.It\'s terrible from top to bottom. To the point that now whenever I watch a lackluster CGDCT I think to myself: ""Well at least it\'s not as bad as Ramen Daisuki.""In my eyes the life blood of a CGDCT show is the characters and their interactions. And here we run into the first major problem of Ramen Daisuki. The chararacters are all extremely one-note. The main girl likes ramen, and that\'s all there is to her character. Yuu loves the main girl who likes ramen, and that\'s all there is to her character. Then there\'s the tsundere, and the bookworm, and.. that\'s it. There\'s nothing more to any of these characters. They never act outside of their formula. They never get development. They never even get notable moments with each other.Ramen Daisuki isn\'t the only CGDCT to have one-note characters. And while I Don\'t like those one-note characters usually most CGDCT are able to recover with the execution of the character interactions. Sure the genki girl and reserved quiet girl pair may be cliche at this point but it works. It\'s always nice to see someone will a friend out of their shell with pure love and support. Usually there\'s an element of fun and folly that are present in their interactions, which makes them fun to watch even if there isn\'t anything that breaks the mold, or develops the characters.But Ramen Daisuki can\'t even manage to do that right. The characters go together like ramen and chocolate: they don\'t. While most CGDCT focus on fun or heartwarming interactions Ramen Daisuki doesn\'t do either of those. Rather it decides to let ramen be the fore focus. The only thing that they talk about is ramen. And sure I get the show is about ramen but that doens\'t mean it should be the only thing that the characters talk about, or experience. Life is not made up of just ramen no matter how much one of the characters may like it. Even their ramen based interactions are lackluster. The stalker girl basically tries to case after the main character over and over again and is constantly rebuked only to be ""let in"" when the main character has to correct her about some stupid thing she said about ramen. While it\'s not the only show that has a push and pull between its main characters, usually there are large signs that the more reserved character is either a tsundere, or shy. They want that love, whether they know it or not and slowly warm up to the other party. This isn\'t true in Ramen Daisuki. The only time Ramen lover shows any sort of like towards the stalker is when she makes her ramen. The only characters also have just as lackluster and uninteresting interactions. It\'s hard to imagine any of them being friends due to the deficent of friendship bonding that appears in the show.While character interactions are a huge thing in CGDCT, there is the other option which is winning via worldbuilding and atmosphere. Of which there is none. The only world that exists here is the next ramen shop that they need to get to.Even on a foodie level this show fails. Sure the ramen looks good but when you spend 12 episodes doing nothing but showing uninteresting flat characters eating ramen it\'s bound to fall flat. There\'s no variation, it\'s only ramen. Most food shows are able to cover an array of food and really bring out the food porn fo the yummy food they\'re eating, but ramen daisuki is only focusing on ramen ever. And while they try to spice it up with all sorts of different types when these different types necessitate long spheals explaining what they are, it quickly devolves into uninteresting territory. I\'m not sure who thought lectures would be funner to watch than characters interacting with each other but whoever did needs to be questioned.The OST is also awful. They repeat the same songs over and over again when they already weren\'t that good to begin with. On their own they\'re already lackluster ut when they appear for the thousandth time it\'s noticeably annoying, which is obviously not what a show should be going for. The songs are very simple and are lacking in flavor. So it makes it worse to hear it every single time.There\'s nothing to this show. The characters are flat and uninteresting. It\'s as if ramen is the only thing that exists in this world, and on top of that the interactions are straight up bad. With bad characters, interactions, and world this show has nothing to offer unless you really want to see ramen. And then you have to put up with the rest just to get that. I\'d say save it and go to a nearby store and by some ramen. It\'ll be much tastier and you won\'t have to deal with this failure of a show. reason.

Most food shows are able to cover an array of food and really bring out the food porn fo the yummy food they\'re eating, but ramen daisuki is only focusing on ramen ever. And while they try to spice it up with all sorts of different types when these different types necessitate long spheals explaining what they are, it quickly devolves into uninteresting territory. I\'m not sure who thought lectures would be funner to watch than characters interacting with each other but whoever did needs to be questioned.The OST is also awful. They repeat the same songs over and over again when they already weren\'t that good to begin with. On their own they\'re already lackluster ut when they appear for the thousandth time it\'s noticeably annoying, which is obviously not what a show should be going for. The songs are very simple and are lacking in flavor. So it makes it worse to hear it every single time.There\'s nothing to this show. The characters are flat and uninteresting. It\'s as if ramen is the only thing that exists in this world, and on top of that the interactions are straight up bad. With bad characters, interactions, and world this show has nothing to offer unless you really want to see ramen. And then you have to put up with the rest just to get that. I\'d say save it and go to a nearby store and by some ramen. It\'ll be much tastier and you won\'t have to deal with this failure of a show.', ""Why should you watch Ramen Daisuki Koizumi San?The story is Fair (6). There's nothing fancy about the story. It's about a girl obsessed with ramen being stalked by her classmate who is obsessed with her. And a ton of useful? facts about ramen, its history, and how to enjoy them best.Art is Very Good (8). I say very well but not in the character department but in how they animate ramen in the story. Each ramen dish is distinct from one another from the color and texture of the soup and noodles to the side dishes that go along with them.Sound is Very Good...(8). It is due to how it induces the feeling that you are in whatever restaurant Koizumi and here classmates dine for a bowl or two of ramen. Additionally, the sound they make while and after finishing a bowl of ramen is hunger-inducing. Moreover, the parts wherein things get a bit emotional, have a very nice melody in them that I love to listen to.Characters are Good (7). I like the cold and nonchalant character of Koizumi, she was made to really stand out in the story as she is the main character who devours those bowls after bowls of ramen. The other characters are just fairly there to decorate and make Koizumi stand out in the show. They are very straightforward.I enjoyed watching all 12 episodes of Ramen Daisuki Koizumi san, and I always look for anything ramen like to eat while or after watching each episode.

It's such an innovative ramen industry advertisement, more so than any other advertisement I've seen. It does exactly what it was intended to do: makes me wish I could just hop on a plane to Japan and have some amazing ramen. No commercial has ever gotten me interested in a product I didn't have previously developed interest in, but this show changes that. My only complaint is that they give too much screen-time to Yuu's stalking, and not Koizumi's Ramen Quest without her, so it feels like I'm seeing the tip of the ice berg. "", 'Once upon a time, there was a girl named Koizumi-san. She loves ramen so much that it became a necessity in her life. The beautiful yet mysterious girl is a master of ramen and has a keen eye to always look for them. Whether it’s from near her home or miles away from civilization, Koizumi is the ramen master of her show.Do you enjoy comedy gags with little plot but focuses on the elements of its genre? Want to watch a show that features over the top humor related to ramen? You’ve come to the right place! Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san is as straightforward as it...gets. The show is about a girl named Koizumi-san who is in love with ramen. She’s a ramen hunter and never ceases to explore the world to develop her interests. I have to admit, watching this show feels almost like a journey of discovery.The first few episodes establishes the principle cast. Koizumi san is the main superstar and has a reserved personality. However, that all changes when she eats ramen and indulges on the thrill of its taste. There’s all types of ramen in this show and her reaction always sells its value thanks to its larger than life humor. It shouldn’t take long at all for the audience to realize that Koizumi is an expert at ramen. Not only does she enjoy ramen but she also knows a wealth of knowledge about them. After being discovered by her classmate Yuu at a ramen shop, we learn more about her and the length she goes to obtain ramen. Watching her climb mountains and sail the high seas to get ramen in her stomach is popcorn entertainment at its finest. Furthermore, Koizumi-san is a brave girl and never shows fear when going into a ramen shop, something that other girls may feel intimidated at first glance. As a student, Koizumi-san is known for her beauty and politeness. She rarely speaks and hardly interacts with others. However, when it’s about ramen, Koizumi-san can talk day and night about it.Of course, there are also other characters that Koizumi-san happens to bump into throughout her journey. The three prominent ones are Yuu, Jun, and Misa. The character chemistry between them ranges quite differently from each other. For instance, Yuu can be seen as borderline obsessed with Koizumi-san whenever they are together. On the other hand, Jun often questions whether Koizumi-san is normal because of her behavior. Throughout the show, Koizumi-san’s influence changes her in ways that she probably didn’t even realize herself. Finally, there’s Misa, a girl that strives to be popular at school. In her eyes, Koizumi-san is a rival and she seems to have a one-sided rivalry with her. While I can’t say none of these relationships are generic, they are entertaining enough to always turn an eye towards Koizumi-san when she gets involved with them.I’m not an expert on ramen but the show almost feels like it’s selling itself as a product. Every episode features different ramen with different flavors whether it’s chicken, beef, shrimp, spicy, sour, and among others. There are even some ramen you’ve never heard of like the blue ramen from one of the later episodes. The majority of the show also features info dump with explanations from the ramen master, Koizumi-san herself. That being said, the story itself is lazily written and seems to never been the intention. Every episode will feel the same and there’s no complicated plot about the show from start to finish. Unfortunately, Koizumi-san is more of a one dimensional character that never seems to develop more than what she is on paper. There’s also hardly any background story about her. Instead, the show fully dedicates on getting her over with the audience through her ramen expertise. The other cast members are no better either as they lack depth or mostly exists to bring out the best from Koizumi-san. Finally, the comedy at times can be questionable. It can get old pretty fast after you’ve seen it a few times and it really never tries anything different. It’s hard to stay focused on this show if you fancy for something more than ramen.Adapted by Studio Gokumi, the show doesn’t lie when it comes to expressing the tastes of ramen. Every time Koizumi-san puts ramen in her stomach, she reacts in a state of ecstasy. To put it simply, it’s foodgasm. The show sells her reactions to make the ramen themselves look good. Character designs for the main cast are very feminine especially the case with Koizumi-san. It’s hard to ignore her with that dazzling blonde hair and gentle face. Surprisingly, the ramen in the show is animated with great detail. From the texture of the toppings to the shape of the ramen, everything about it feels right.This version of foodgasm needed a diverse voice cast and thankfully, the VA in the show pulls it off. The main voice to pay attention to is Koizumi-san especially when she narrates the info details about ramen. Then, there’s the way other characters react to her that amplifies their personalities in particular Yuu and Misa. The theme songs for the show is colorful and focuses a lot on the ramen theme more than you should expect.Honestly, I don’t even like ramen that much. They’re not good for health and serves more as a guilty pleasure meal than anything else. However, this show opened my eyes ramen in a way that I didn’t realize before. It’s not the plot that impressed me nor is it the popcorn comedy. Rather, the show was able to sell what it had intended to and I’m a satisfied customer. gets.

The ramen looks pretty nice too.I first heard of this anime from watching a short YouTube video called ""Cutest German Loli You\'ll Ever See Kawaii Overload"". Don\'t ask. But it mentioned the anime it came from in the beginning and I was intrigued. I mean, who wouldn\'t love an anime about...cute girls eating ramen? AND BOY WAS THIS ANIME SOMETHING ELSE.Story 10: Hojou-chan: ""Guys, what if we make an anime with a cute protagonist"". Takade-san: ""Sounds SUPER ORIGINAL, what\'s the plot?"". Hojou-chan: ""..."". The story in RDK is basically RAMEN IS DELICIOUS AF. I don\'t think I\'ve ever had such an urge to eat ramen from watching only two minutes of an anime. I almost cried in the finale were Koizumi-san returns to her beloved ramen for the first time in two weeks, it is a very emotional moment and I was holding back tears.Art 10: WHAT IS THIS FACE ANIMATION? THIS IS LIKE RAMEN HENTAI. The faces people make (namely Koizumi-san) when eating ramen are some of the most priceless images I have ever witnessed in any anime to-date. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the food looks super tasty.Sound 10: The OP and ED are good but the crown jewel here is THE SLURPING SOUNDS. Why does ramen eating sound so sexual in this anime? NOBODY KNOWS. But this is music to my ears and I\'m slightly tempted to listen to ramen eating ASMR after writing this review. That jingle is ridiculously catchy as well.Character 10: You got the stalker, the diva, the ramen yandere, AND ONE NORMAL PERSON. What more could you ask for? The diva and the ramen yandere are super cute and I can barely restrain myself from adding them to favorite characters.Enjoyment 1: I didn\'t anticipate how much ramen I would need to make it through this so I was starving almost the whole way through. Pray for Kallocarina-sanSo in conclusion RAMEN IS TASTY. THIS IS A PROFOUND LIFE STATEMENT MADE BY THIS ANIME AND I AM IN LOVE WITH EVERY MOMENT THESE THREE MAGICAL WORDS ARE REINFORCED.

At first, I was looking for some anime to recommend when I liked the slice-of-life and cooking genres, Ramen Daizuki also appeared on the list and became the first after I got addicted to Shouma in Food Wars!I enjoy every episode presented by Ramen Daizuki, the story is very light and seems boring maybe for some people of course, and for some reason that's actually what I'm looking for. I like any genre of anime, even if it's boring, I can enjoy it.I also give 8/10 for Ramen Daizuki overall because I...can enjoy it hahaha. However, there is one interesting thing I want to ask the creators of Ramen Daizuki anime, why do I think that Yuu is a lesbian? I'm sorry about that because Yuu is sooo stands out, she's so obsessed with a ramen enthusiast, Koizumi. Honestly, it makes me think about it all the time hahaha.In conclusion, for people who like genres that are very light even if they are boring, I recommend you try watching this.Thank youAnnisa PuziantiIndonesia can enjoy it hahaha.

Other than the ramen part, I'd actually forget that I even watch this.The yuri here is... bad. It's annoying almost.For the characters, Yuu's main trait is being a lesbo, Misa is the typical girl that you'd either love or hate (I certainly liked her), Jun is just a bookworm who has backgrounds left unexplained, and lastly, Koizumi isn't even a character. She's a walking plot-device made to introduce Ramen to others. She's thinning...the line between cardboard and Mary sue. All of them are one-dimensional characters which... is disappointing.Overall it's the most 5/10 anime that I've watched. the line between cardboard and Mary sue.

I hope it helps decide to watch or not this series.If you're expecting some slice of life with some a good story, don't watch this.If I were to compare this series it'll be with Dagashi Kashi but with zero character development. At least in Dagashi Kashi you have some sense that the characters are moving foward, although the story development of this is slow, even in the manga.The first 4 episodes present you four girls, two will have the most time on screen, Koizumi and the girl with short hair that stalks her. Then it doesn't move...a bit after the first episode. But they explain a lot about ramen and it's different types. It is until episode 5 that you get some 'development' with Koizumi and the girl with short hair, after that episode they just forget about what happened in episode 5 and it stays the same.It doesn't have funny gags or some sense of interaction with the two main girls. It's pretty much that the short hair girl follows Koizumi everywhere and kind of force her to talk to her, only for the anime to go for the main course, which as I said is to explaing the different tipes of ramen and how to eat it.The art is less than decent. The characters are not interesting at all, Koizumi a bit for the first episodes but after that is always the same. The enjoyment depends on the person, if you expect some drama or funny things, you'll get bored fast, if you expect to learn about ramen is okay, but I much prefer to look online for that instead of losing my time watching something. a bit after the first episode.

A dish that combines a broth with noodles and various toppings to form a savory meal.  It’s one of my favorite dishes, and if given the chance, I would like to eat the dishes that Koizumi ate.  The show succeeds by informing and providing the viewers an ample amount of information regarding ramen.  However, the story is very repetitive and gets old quickly, and the characters are uninteresting, including one annoyance.STORY:Story summary: Koizumi is a beautiful and mysterious high school student, who enjoys eating ramen.  Everyday, she hunts for the best ramen restaurants and eats at...it.The story is simple and repetitive.  Each episode contains two to three segments about the various types of ramen that Koizumi consumes.  These segment, while somewhat connected to each other, fail to form any story arc.  Most segments within each episode can be summarized like this:1. A curious or interested person (e.g. Yuu, Misa, Jun, etc) follows Koizumi.2. Koizumi stops at a ramen restaurant, curious or interested person follows.3. They both eat ramen and both have a foodgasm.4. Koizumi, may or may not, spout some random knowledge about the ramen.5. Koizumi leaves the restaurant, searching for a new one.Repeat the steps above and that’s pretty much the entire show.  Most dialogues revolve around dull interactions or conversations, Yuu yelling the name “Koizumi” hundreds of times, Koizumi saying random information about the ramen she is eating or about to eat, etc.  Basically, this series was produced to encourage people to learn about ramen, and the multitude of ways it can be created.ANIMATION:The art is acceptable for a food show.  The background objects, such as buildings, utensils, unmoving pedestrians, furniture, trees, etc, are very barebones, showing only the necessities.  Moreover, most backgrounds are filled with various screen tones like stars, roses, sparking lights, etc, to reinforce the characters’ emotions.  The characters designs are fine and well drawn, especially their facial expressions during foodgasm moments, where blushes and looks of euphoria consumes them.  And finally, as a food show, the ramen is visually appealing, displaying different dishes with a plateful of details.SOUND:Like most food series, you will hear many characters make exclamations of “aah”, “ooh”, and “mmm” in response to seeing and/or eating their dish.  In addition, expect countless slurping and gulping sounds accompanied with looks of satisfactions from eating the dish.The voice acting is good, despite the characters having a narrow number of emotions and expressions.  Still, their performance is worth mentioning.  The opening song is your standard J-Pop that features Koizumi and other characters eating ramen at various locations, while the ending song is a bit more rock n’ roll sounding.  The background music is nothing spectacular as there are a few of them and tend to repeat, for example when Koizumi makes her entrance or appearance, the closing song of each small segments, or any songs to reinforce character reactions.CHARACTERS:The characters were uninteresting and forgettable, despite appearing and acting cute.  They are devoid of any decent background stories or development, and their one-track personality coupled with their one-track reactions to obvious situations or individuals gets stale and repetitive.  Here is a brief description of our main characters:Koizumi, as obviously stated in the anime’s title, loves ramen and will eat anything that involves ramen.  Beyond that, she is a cold and antisocial person, who brushes off friendship advances, especially from Yuu, and has limited dialogue, talking mostly about ramen, such as their locations, the ingredients used in them, and the history and culture behind them.Yuu is a loud, energetic stalker, who follows Koizumi almost everywhere in an attempt to become friends with her.  Her obsessions with her is somewhat strange and disturbing, however the series plays it for laughs.  Unfortunately, for me anyway, her constant yelling and continuous demand to be Koizumi’s friend is irritating.Misa is a twin tailed classmate of Yuu, who occasionally becomes jealous of Yuu’s increasing obsession with Koizumi.  She enjoys eating spicy ramen and, once in awhile, eats with Koizumi.Jun is a studious and bespectacled girl, who is the student representative for Koizumi’s, Misa’s, and Yuu’s class.  She states to not “like” eating ramen in public because it fogged up her glasses once, however upon meeting Koizumi, she has overcome this problem and enjoys eating it again.ENJOYMENT:Compared to many other food related series, this one felt very mundane and repetitive.  The story lacked substance or any consistent story arc, and the characters were bland and forgettable.  Overall, it’s best to skip this series, and watch other food related series, such as Koufuku Graffiti, the Shokugeki no Souma series, or Isekai Shokudou; at least, these shows provide either a consistent story arc and/or interesting and dynamic characters. it.The story is simple and repetitive.

Girl has to be made of money too because you know this stuff isn\'t cheap.The art in the show is pretty well done. The Ramen looks delicious. Every episode leaves me hungry for a bowl but reluctantly all I\'m left with is a feeling of sadness at the realization that store bought Ramen will never compare to the ""store bought"" Ramen from this show. And the faces they (the characters) make on this show are that of pure ecstasy when they are eating the ramen. It\'s no surprise that heads turn anytime these girls eat Ramen with the expressions they\'re making.Overall, an OK show for a seasonal anime. Can\'t see the appeal outside of the seasonal format but if you like good looking food OR You\'re a college student trying to fight the urge to vomit everytime you get a bowl yourself, watch this show and it\'ll change your stomach for the better... and then disappoint it later on when you try some yourself. her friends brush it off apparently?

The theme itself is already pretty interesting, attracting people who likes ramen or wants to...know about ramen, or maybe even people who just wants to watch a show focusing on food.Story-7/10as you would expect from an anime about food, there isn\'t much of a story going on other than developments of relationship between characters. The show also mentions the origin, stories, or the taste of the ramen in depth, which is really informative and interesting.Art-8/10Has quite a few scenes where the characters are deformed, which only adds to my enjoyment, never too much. Good balance between scenes with realistic proportions and deformed scenes. Not unique, but well drawn in a normal way. The deformed scenes really add a lot of comedy to this show with the exaggerated expressions and all, and the realistic scenes just makes me go ""awwwww"".Sound-8/10I\'m not experienced to rate the BGMs, but one thing I definitely love about this show is the opening and the ending. The opening is very lively with great music and singer, which hypes me up everytime I get to the opening, plus it has really catchy parts. The ending is like a Japanese rap but more musical, and somehow comforting, and heartwarming(?). The lyrics of both opening and ending goes really well with the show, if you can understand it. Even litsening just by the song itself it\'s really good, unlike some OPs and EDs that are initially good with the show, but feels lacking something listened by itself.Characters-8/10The main characters have opposite personalities, which really brings their character out.  Watching Koizumi-san (main character) slowly getting known better with Yuu (another main character) really warms my heart and is really pleasing to watch. Different supporting characters when eating different types of ramen really brings out the story and humane feelings(?) of ramen.Enjoyment-10/10I personally enjoys comforting shows really much, so with cute characters and OPs EDs this great, what could go wrong? As a bonus it\'s also about a popular comfort food in Japan. The feeling of watching the show after a long, tiring day is just pure bliss and makes me go to sleep feeling satisfied and happy.Overall-9/10It might be lacking for people looking for action or intense romance, drama and stuff, but it\'s just perfect for people looking for a comforting show after a long day. These shows are those where you don\'t try to pick out the cons of it, but instead just enjoy it without worrying about anything. know about ramen, or maybe even people who just wants to watch a show focusing on food.Story-7/10as you would expect from an anime about food, there isn\'t much of a story going on other than developments of relationship between characters.

Because that's all you're getting by watching this show.Let me rephrase that. The main star of this show is the Ramen in all of it's variations and locations to be consumed and the cute girls are just cardboard cutouts showcasing the dish and the culture behind the consumption of this dish.Don't be fooled, although this might end up in the same category of other food porn shows like Shokugeki, or Koufuku Graffiti the visuals on the dishes are just passable without being memorable, specially since it's always Ramen. The difference between those shows and Ramen...Daisuki is that those have either a story arc with plenty of characterization or just endearing character interactions with the cast. Ramen Daisuki makes no effort in gathering the group of girls and create bonds that would tell more about their Ramen corporation embassadors. Quite the opposite, Koizumi-san is a loner that has only one thing on her mind, that's it, you guessed it, it's Ramen. Koizumi is some half-assed Saiki-san joke where she's mostly unreachable by her peers and she'll just end up brushing off Yuu, although at times she will encounter and accept the company of Misa & Jun. Her relationship with Jun might be the less absurd, but it's the most boring since all they talk or rather all Koizumi does is blurt out a plethora of how great Ramen and it's culture is.In terms of animation is quite decent, but at times it relies too much on panning stills. The unique washed out color palette makes it a bit different from the pack though. The soundtrack is nothing that grabs anyone's attention, and it's actually pretty limited wich tends to repeat, specially when Koizumi enters scene and you know it's her just by the soundtrack playing in the background.Long story short. This is nothing but a glorified slurping Ramen TV spot with a catchy jingle and girls having foodgasms. A visually compliant but souless piece of entertainment. If you like shows featuring cute girls with more substance, there's pleanty to choose from on this season.

This is a show about ramen, with the story and characters being more or less a vessel to talking about various types of ramen, showing off real life restaurant chains, noodle brands etc., etc. If you want to know more about ramen, learn about and try out new variants of it, this is a show for you. If you expect anything more... Probably not.This being said, the slice-of-life content is not horrible. Visual quality, character...design, music and voice acting are all at a very decent level. The story is silly and purely episodic and some people can be irritated with certain elements of it (mainly the protagonist, Yuu, being absolutely obsessed with Koizumi and stalking her all the time). It's this kind of rather pointless, pseudo-romantic comedy plot that doesn't go anywhere and is only occasionally funny. If anything, it's rather mundane, if not completely unamusing.The main point though, ramen trivia, is implemented in a very cool way and I've actually learned a ton of interesting information and got more curious about the varieties of ramen available in my country. In a way, it's a similar experience to playing the Go! Go! Nippon! visual novel – not really a great game by any definition, but a fun, relaxing source of both trivia and genuinely useful information.

Plot-wise, the structure of most episodes follows the setup LA just talked about repeated twice or thrice depending on the episode. The plot doesn\'t have any overarching elements to it besides Yuu trying to constantly befriend Koizumi but we get to know the characters and especially the mysterious...Koizumi in the process.On speaking of which, character-wise, the characters have some of the typical archetypes of the typical ""cute girls doing cute things"", from the tsundere Misa to the shy Jun to the genki Yuu and the eponymous Koizumi-san taking the ""deadpan serious"" archetype. Out of the ""main cast"", LA\'s favourite character would had to be Jun, mainly because most of her interactions to the cast and especially Koizumi was LA\'s favourite and gave out some fair few laughs, probably being the best audience surrogate in the anime. Yuu...well she\'s a bit difficult to say to say the least and we\'re talking about one of the more narratively focused characters in the anime (the other obviously being Koizumi).  Well time to get the elephant of the room and that\'s she\'s EXTREMELY clingy to Koizumi even defying common sense some times and to some extent LA can see Yuu\'s plight in just wanting to be friends with Koizumi but where it\'s difficult to like Yuu is her extremely stalkerish behavior she displays especially in the latter episodes and sure...bring in the yuri undertones...but tone it down is all LA is saying, even with that LA doesn\'t mind Yuu as a character as MANY detractors seems to find her as, there is at least some plot thread making the episodes flow together, no matter how annoying. Koizumi being the central character in all this, she does for the most part move the ""plot"" forward considering her ONLY interest is towards ramen and she\'s just a database of ramen trivia, some LA didn\'t even knew existed, but towards her interactions with other characters she\'s mostly deadpan and carefree and subtlety helps characters in need...before or after eating ramen of course but Yuu is the exception to all this.  Koizumi is the ""mysterious"" character and by the end of it, that\'s what ends up as, knowing VERY little of her besides her love for ramen, but LA thinks it\'s fine, we ""don\'t"" need as she\'s essentially the ""guide"" for ramen for the uninitiated. Keep the ""mystery"" alive ya\'know?But to the detractors of this anime, LA DOES get that there is barely any substance in this anime besides ramen. It\'s ALL about the ramen and because of that it substitutes ramen with character development and that\'s very much at the expense of it\'s characters and by an extent, it\'s loose plot. BUT LA will give that the interactions towards the main cast is enough for this kind of anime to see some sense of characters ""wanting"" to come through as well as accentuating it\'s more comedic moments.But on the other hand, Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san did it\'s job in making LA crave for ramen whenever LA watched it, by showing amazingly detailed and beautifully made ramen, it\'s essentially felt like Shokugeki no Souma: RAMEN EDITION (but obviously without the Shokugeki\'s) by the level of detail of animation it had and yes quickly transitioning into that would be that the animation done by Studio Gokumi and AXsiZ did amazingly in the food porn, while the character designs were no slouch either giving us very distinct and instantly noticeable character designs while still having it\'s super chibi moments for one-shot comedic moments. Cute girls doing cute things was in Studio Gokumi\'s ball park so LA was expecting the animation to be moe and it\'s easily succeeded with the deliciously tasty looking ramen food porn to go with it.Voice acting was again expectedly moe and seems like Ayana Taketatsu moved on from dagashi to ramen eh?. The thing LA was really unexpected was Ayana Taketatsu\'s role as Koizumi being soo deadpan serious, LA was thinking she gonna be more of a Hotaru Shidare (thus the comparison) but LA kinda understood Ayana\'s and by extent Koizumi\'s deadpan cadence through this anime. Ayane Sakura was great to be honest, with her genkiness shown to a rather absorbent amount in this anime with her enthusiasm with ramen and Koizumi and fine LA will say she DOES get annoying BUT, praise is praise and Ayane Sakura nonetheless did decently as Yuu. LA found Akari Kito and Yumi Hara as Misa and Jun respectively to be great all round even if this isn\'t exactly their ""best"" LA saw from them but nonetheless but if LA had to pick an MVP in this anime then it\'ll be........a tie between Ayana and Yumi Hara.Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san has it\'s faults and it\'s strengths in being a ""cute girls doing cute things"" anime centred on ramen, but this is easily a case where the anime likes to focus more on ramen than it\'s characters or it\'s barely there plot, but if you like ramen be it the instant or the real Japanese deal then Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san will slurp your way into your psyche.For LA, LA will get LA\'s fill and be.......just satisfied with it, nothing more, nothing else.Thank you for the anime...

The first is the standard and incredibly boring group of high school girl anime stereotypes going on adventures tangentially related to the main character, Koizumi, featuring one of my least favorite tropes of all time: a girl with a creepy obsession who can\'t take ""no"" for an answer and is one genre-shift away from going full yandere. This part of the series of abysmally boring and I often find myself getting distracted when it\'s the focus.The reason I kept watching\xa0Ms. Koizumi Loves Ramen Noodles\xa0despite its dreary side characters is Koizumi herself and her adventures -...Koizumi, like me, just wants to talk about ramen and be left alone by her fellow students. Each episode\'s other half features her going to various ramen joints, trying new recipes, and giving the audience tips for serving up the perfect bowl. Of course, as with any half-decent food anime, the art goes all-out to make sure even the most humble instant ramen looks inhumanly delicious. Many nights where I watched the show were spent trying out these new dishes for myself and realizing just how big the world of Japanese ramen really is. These segments of the show reminded me of the short series Wakako-zake and I found myself asking more and more as the series went on if maybe it should have been a short anime itself.Ms. Koizumi Loves Ramen Noodles is thoroughly enjoyable when it focuses on being a food anime, and my guess from how bland and cliche every other aspect is that the series even having any other focus is thanks to some editor appealing to the lowest common denominator of otaku culture. Clearly, the heart of\xa0Ms. Koizumi Loves Ramen Noodles is in its food, and it shines so brightly in this that for food anime fans, its worth putting up with an otherwise lackluster presentation. Koizumi, like me, just wants to talk about ramen and be left alone by her fellow students. Each episode\'s other half features her going to various ramen joints, trying new recipes, and giving the audience tips for serving up the perfect bowl. Of course, as with any half-decent food anime, the art goes all-out to make sure even the most humble instant ramen looks inhumanly delicious. Many nights where I watched the show were spent trying out these new dishes for myself and realizing just how big the world of Japanese ramen really is.

I love Japanese food.The only reason I rate it 8 is because of ramen and the slurping and how detailed the food are, it makes me hungry for ramen. I do like the animation a lot. The opening song is pretty catchy and I like it.The only problem is, it's not enough. I know the anime and manga explores different types of ramen but, it could've been better with better character chemistry and development.

The exploration of ramen in this show was just fantastic and I really learned a lot. It became a ritual at our house to make ramen and watch a couple episodes and apply what we'd learned last time. When the show is covering ramen, I'd rate it a 9 or 10.The...really low was the character relationships. Yuu was just plain creepy. I was pretty sure for a while that this was going to take a twist and become a horror anime. Sadly, it did not. I wonder if the main character is a girl in the hopes that her stalker behaviour would seem less creepy and terrifying but if so, it didn't work for me. Koizumi loves ramen and that's about the extent of her character. Watching Koizumi interact with Jun and Misa was much better though and made the interactions with Yuu all the worse. It was genuinely uncomfortable at times.Overall, it's something I'm glad I've watched and I'll probably think of it every time I eat a kind of ramen we tried due to the show.

Yuu starts making excuses and following Koizumi as she goes around sampling ramen from various restaurants.Art 8/10They spent a ton of budget animating the ramen so it looks good, like some of the clear soups look like real life actual ramen soup, down to the droplets of oil. The meat and vegetables glisten seductively. And the noodles, they\'re various size / shapes and look curly and springy when being slurped. It\'s...enough to make one drool and crave ramen. So needless to say the art of the food is 10/10 but the characters are just 6/10 so this averages out to 8/10.Sound 6/10The OSTs were forgettable. The voice acting was okay. They could have done better slurping sounds.Characters 4/10It was hard for me to tolerate Yuu, who is basically a creepy stalker who does not respect Koizumi\'s boundary issues. Koizumi herself is aloof but knows what she wants and does not want. How many times does Koizumi have to say ""NO"" before Yuu gets the message? Even if she is trying to be nice, this kind of pestering is unacceptable. If Yuu had been male, this kind of behavior would result in a restraining order. The other characters, Misa, Jun and Yuu\'s brother were actually okay but I have to say I had a hard time tolerating Yuu.Enjoyment 5/10.

An anime oft passively deduced to be no more than a show of seasonal exploitation, a show with no original themes to be seen, and no content worth praise. After all, how could a show about nothing more than eating ramen noodles be anything worth mentioning? Well, to those of you who have not the eye to discern how revolutionary this show is, I shall help to guide you to a conclusion of better knowledge.The most common critique I have seen for this show is that it has no substance. It is simply one episode after another displaying women eating ramen...noodles in a provocative manner, as to bait the lowest of men into viewing it. And yet, this very simplistic principal is just what makes the show so great. As Leonardo da Vinci once said: “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” This holds quite true in the case of Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san. To say that this show is shallow would be no more than pure sophistry, for in its simplicity lies true sophistication. In the show we follow a young woman by the name of Koizumi as she compares the delicacies of different ramen noodles, and in this premise we see just how indescribably variegated the show becomes. In each and every scene depicting the consumption of ramen noodles, the viewer is met with far more than a simple dining experience, for in such scenes, Koizumi exudes such an immaculate style of eating that any form of etiquette is suddenly nought but an antiquity to be forgotten. Every single movement is captivating, from the first bite to the very last masticate of every bowl of noodles. My words can bring no true description of the beauty of Koizumi’s eating, for there exist no words so prepossessing as to describe such an image. In each and every scene I find myself feeling enlightened, and yet utterly crushed at the same time, for I now know the image of perfection, and yet can never accomplish it. Thus is the true complexity found in this show.But to this you say no. Simply watching a person eat could bring no such clarity to one’s life, but to you who say this, I can give no more than great pity, for you shall never comprehend the true image of perfection, but perhaps that is for the best, for one such as you may be driven mad by knowledge that perfection lies so far from yourself. And if this still does not give you satisfaction enough to understand, I provide you with the following. It is said that a good show should bring forth the simplest meanings, yet still allow those who look to contrive a far greater understanding. But just what is the meaning of Ramen Daisuki Koizumi-san? That is simple. Ramen is tasty. But how could a statement so unembellished bring forth greater meaning? I ask you to consider this statement once more: Ramen is tasty. This declaration is no more than pure genius, for the scope of all civilization is found within it. For centuries, man has continued to evolve, to develop, to adapt, simply to find what they desire. In this case, the desire is something tasty, for who could not have such a desire? And yet there are those who believe that to desire is to be untrue, to be unwhole, to be lesser than those who find purity in wanting nothing. To this I ask, is a man not entitled to what they wish for? \'No!\' says the man in Washington, \'It belongs to the poor.\' \'No!\' says the man in the Vatican, \'It belongs to God.\' \'No!\' says the man in Moscow, \'It belongs to everyone.\' I reject these answers, for through the light of ramen noodles, I have found true clarity. I will listen not to the sputtering of propaganda against that which I want, saying that true enlightenment can only be found in following the beliefs of others, that to go against the majority is foolish, that only under a single united mind could true understanding be found. But this is wrong. A man chooses, a slave obeys. And I choose to search for that which I find to be tasty, just as Koizumi has before me. I will hold the right to decide my own fate, for no other could ever guide me. What is the greatest lie ever created? What is the most vicious obscenity ever perpetrated on mankind? Slavery? The Holocaust? Dictatorship? No. It\'s the tool with which all that wickedness is built: altruism. Whenever anyone wants others to do their work, they call upon their altruism. Never mind your own needs, they say, think of the needs of... of whoever. The state. The poor. Of the army, of the king, of God! The list goes on and on. How many catastrophes were launched with the words “think of yourself”? It\'s the ""king and country"" crowd who light the torch of destruction. It is this great inversion, this ancient lie, which has chained humanity to an endless cycle of guilt and failure. Only in finding what we truly desire as an individual can we ever be enlightened, for enlightenment comes only when it is a part of your accepted belief. And thus I say once more. Ramen is tasty. Not because it was written so in stone. Not because it was declared by a great leader before the masses. Not because it was said by a holy being that humans cannot perceive. No. It is because I believe it to be true, and therefore, no greater truth exists.I thank you, Andrew Ryan. noodles in a provocative manner, as to bait the lowest of men into viewing it.

She seems dangerous enough to be a danger to her own family members and friends who have begun to take either an interest or gotten naturally close to her target. Often enough, you'd see her throwing dangerous stares at those who have gotten closer to her or may or may have not taken an interest in her as a person.Not sure what the anime wanted to convey with this and if you'd count out the blue-haired psycho, it'd be an easygoing iyashi-kei foodie anime. Maybe there was a peak in parasocial behavior among teens?Lol, IDK, it's weird and random to have Yuu go full cray cray like that.In the beginning, you could maybe still laugh it off, but gradually, the editing wants you to take her craziness more seriously and the show ends with both doing their own thing, Koizumi being the ramen-loving blackhole and Yuu who's relentlessly and endlessly observing and harassing her and her friends expressing light concern over her obsession. longer ignore and feel concern over the ramen-loving girl's safety.Despite Yuu saying in her mind that she adamantly wants to be Koizumi's friend, it often reaches perverse levels of wanting to see her skin and going as far as fantasizing about them both at a wedding venue.

I watched Food Wars for the cooking, and gave zero shits about the plot and fanservice for the most part. If that’s the way you treat food anime, this show is for you. It’s a comfort show of mine, something I put on in the background.I’d say mild spoilers but like, tbh it’s girls eating ramen, there’s not really anything to spoil.Pros:- The ramen. There’s so much of it as expected, but they also delve into the places of origin and preparation methods, nothings off the table, they try chocolate ramen at one point....Each character has their own preference and that also influences the story slightly. The stills of the ramen are beautiful too.Mixed:- The characters. None of the 4 main girls go through much development nor do you hear much about who they are, which I was fine with, the plot is just girls eating ramen I wasn’t expecting much, but I did see some people were bothered by it, so that’s something to consider if it matters. They all have their own quirks and they play off each other nicely for a bit of comedy.- The animation. The ramen shots are beautiful but everything else is pretty much lower quality animation, not a lot of movement, random cutaways to legs or other non moving scenes, a good amount of standing/sitting and talking. Again though, it is just girls eating ramen, so I was fine with it.- The sounds. Do not watch this if you have misophonia, there’s a lot of slurping and chewing sounds, general anime eating noises, etc. The characters sometimes moan a bit too, which I was a little put off by, I know ramen’s tasty but it’s not *that* tasty.Cons:- YUU. Koizumi may be the titular character but the the story is mostly told through the POV of Yuu, the girl with the short dark hair. When Koizumi isn’t involved, she’s great! A little ditzy, an excellent cook, sort of a middleman to the other 2 girls. When Koizumi is involved, she immediately nosedives to annoying as hell. She’s got a crush on Koizumi, which would be cute, but she expresses it through inserting herself into Koizumi’s ramen trips despite explicit “no”s, ignoring her boundaries, being jealous when her other 2 friends get closer to Koizumi by treating her like a human being, and then it eventually escalates to stalking and yandere tendencies. Gross. Genuinely the worst part of the show. I came here for ramen, not toxic lesbian relationships.All in all, despite it being pretty average realistically, and the main character being terrible, the ramen is enough to keep me coming back to this show, and I don’t rewatch shows often. If they just cut out the weird yandere part, it would be an easy 10 for me. Each character has their own preference and that also influences the story slightly.

There really isn’t all that much storyline to it, but the reason why I have quite a low opinion on it is because none of the characters really have a set “personality”. They just don’t seem “real” to me because all the characters are a stereotypical character you see in anime and manga. Except this anime follows every concept to the T and it doesn’t leave any room for curiosity. Also like I mentioned before, THERE IS NO STORYLINE. If you like slice of life that doesn’t progress an inch, maybe you’ll like this one. ']"

I would recommend watching this with friends."", 'I initially stumbled onto this series because of the reference to the film in Moyoco Anno\'s biographical manga about her husband, ""Insufficient Direction""! It was cited there as an early influence for the famous Neon Genesis Evangelion director, so — of course, I had to give this feature a try! I originally expected a spooky, mystery scenario... but the narrative somehow manages to spiral around, and ends up punching you in the face with the message that big companies are bad and don\'t care about your health!⚠️ This review will contain spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersThis film is not what you will expect it to be. We start...out with a seaside manor ghost story, starring a vengeful phantom, and then that arc suddenly ends with a suspiciously green soda that is turning people into human-crustacean mutants, followed up by a flamboyant finale battle, that is reminiscent to something out of a tokusatsu TV special! It\'s wild, apparently one sip of Boa juice turns its innocent consumers into a horde of mindless crab people! The plot actually is able to effectively pull it off, and the corporate executives turn out to be the reason behind Captain Phantom\'s murder, and is presented, in the end, as a vigilante against an oppressive system, rather than just a menacing bone man! Captain Phantom is a very iconic anti-hero of his time, along with Tatsunoko\'s ""Casshern""!While there is the basic message of ""big companies rob the people of their money and health"" — there is a split consensus of whether this movie actually has a good message, and here\'s why... the most obvious interpretation is to show the exploitation of capitalist marketing, but the second reading of the film is a little bit more sinister, you see, the greedy manufacturers of the soda are called ""Golem"" and after reading a little bit into the usage of the word, a ""Golem"" is a derogatory word against Jewish people, so there is a slight ""Zionist conspiracy"" slant to the narrative. According to Moment Magazine, ""the golem is a highly mutable metaphor with seemingly limitless symbolism. It can be a victim or villain, Jew or non-Jew, man or woman — or sometimes both. Over the centuries it has been used to connote war, community, isolation, hope, and despair.""I had no idea that the innuendo was in the film, until after I had finished watching it and took a deeper look into the ""Golem"" thing, so while I was watching it, it just seemed like a run-of-the-mill kid\'s film, similar to an episode of ""Scooby Doo"" or something! It had underwater bases, giant squids, a giant robot (designed by none other than Ghibli\'s ""Hayao Miyazaki""), and kids beating the baddies with the power of resourcefulness and optimism. Since it was originally released in 1969, the antisemitic innuendoes wouldn\'t be too out of the question. It would be a shame if that were a case though, this film has such a unique mood and it was genuinely captivating for what it was!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Hiroshi Ikeda (screenwriter and director), notable works:* Dōbutsu Takarajima (""Animal Treasure Island"")* Hustle Punch* King Kong: 001/7 Tom Thumb* Mogura no Motoro* Mahōtsukai Chappy — Episode Director* Mahōtsukai Sally — Episode Director* Ōkami Shōnen KenCommentary: I have only watched a few episodes of ""Mahōtsukai Sally"" and seen a couple of clips of ""Dōbutsu Takarajima,"" so I can\'t really comment on Mr. Ikeda\'s overall directing skills, but I thought the atmosphere and some of the animation techniques in Soratobu Yūreisen were impressive, especially for the time that it came out!

Character and plot development is minimal, and the film could've benefitted from an extra 30 minutes.

San Ti,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50445/San_Ti,"['If you\'re interested in San Ti (三体) Animated or Three-Body, you had better watch the Tencent live-action adaptation which is available on Tencent\'s YouTube channel for free. The live-action adapts the first book of the Three-Body trilogy, which is indeed the ""Three-Body"" novel, while the animation adapts the second novel titled The Dark Forest ""黑暗森林"" (Hei An Sen Lin). If you go into bilibili\'s San Ti without watching the live-action, you will be missing a decent amount of context that sets up the plot for the animated series, especially the first episode with all the narration and monologues.That being said, compared to the long and...steady plot progression of Tencent\'s live-action series (30 40-minute episodes in total), bilibili\'s San Ti goes into full overdrive the first two episodes, with constant action that does allow some respite from time to time. San Ti will demand your full attention to detail in order to fully enjoy and appreciate it.San Ti, however, seems to suffer from the bad pacing, and unlike the live-action, the animation\'s storyline seems so weird and bizarre. It\'s also not easy to appreciate the MC, Luo Ji, whose manner and behavior are so grating and painful to watch, at least in the first few episodes, though it gets better towards the end.I don\'t have much (or anything) to say about the content and how well it has been adapted from the novels because I have not read any of the novels, but the animation quality is pretty good, I must say. If you\'ve watched the live-action series, you\'ll see some animated sequences within the series itself. Bilibili\'s animation is similar to that, but much more polished and cartoonish.I would definitely recommend this series, if only just to know the aftermath of the events that transpired in the live-action series. steady plot progression of Tencent\'s live-action series (30 40-minute episodes in total), bilibili\'s San Ti goes into full overdrive the first two episodes, with constant action that does allow some respite from time to time.

It\'s also not easy to appreciate the MC, Luo Ji, whose manner and behavior are so grating and painful to watch, at least in the first few episodes, though it gets better towards the end.I don\'t have much (or anything) to say about the content and how well it has been adapted from the novels because I have not read any of the novels, but the animation quality is pretty good, I must say. If you\'ve watched the live-action series, you\'ll see some animated sequences within the series itself.

This animation by the ‘Yihua Kaitian’ studio is completely shit.The animation is a disaster. The characters have unnatural zombie-ish movements. The light and shadow shown in it is unrealistic and is breaching the physics laws. A lot of background textures are cheaply shared by multiple places. Some minor scenes are obviously cut corners in the point of carefulness. For example, in the scene of the Go game, the black player’s third move is clearly irrational. The studio does not pay attention to making this animation.Also, the...plot is shitty too. The first volume of the novel is cut completely, and the summary of it in the anime is kind of abstract. The plot is significantly modified from the original work, making the characters stupid and irrational. The main character Luo Ji is a clown in the animation. Side characters did not escape their fate of being ruined either; Ding Yi became completely a crazy guy in the animation. The studio does not fully understand the original work and arrogantly redesign the story, making a full digestion of turning the nutritious original work into the shitty waste presented. They completely changed the original style, but this did not make the expression better.There is a artful criticism of this animation in China, ‘The problem facing by Yihua Kaitian (the studio) is that there are three suns (the Fanfiction ‘Mine tri-body’ the live-action ‘Tri-body Problem’ and the radio play ‘Tri-body Problem’) moving around it, and it is the planet of tri-body civilization which is being exterminating every time.’ This clearly shows the problem of watching this animation.

In this special episode that has been weirdly cut into 2 parts, we welcome the original cast back in the prequel (let's assume this is a sequel) who for some reason got into somewhere creepy and people started disappearing one by one.So, the first and only thing I'm already finding wrong is the fact the place of horror happens to be a hot spring. Why? Out of all the places...it could have thought of, like an abandoned castle (which is where the Elite Four and the CHAMPION reside), a haunted forest, catacombs, or even an abandoned city which is a viable choice since its time is 3000 years into the future. Without much saying, the idea of their haunted place is already wrong and feels culturally insulting since they would rather take a shortcut and make it about the cast going into a Japanese-style Hot spring while apparently, people have regressed into the Medieval Ages.Other than that, it's your casual subpar episode about people having their antics, pranking each other, and ending in an oh-so predictable way, who would've thought this might happen? For people who are needing time to kill with another generic episode, have fun with this. it could have thought of, like an abandoned castle (which is where the Elite Four and the CHAMPION reside), a haunted forest, catacombs, or even an abandoned city which is a viable choice since its time is 3000 years into the future.

Teekyuu 6,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31440/Teekyuu_6,"[""What do you think when you watch sports anime? Many who're fans of Kuroko, Yowamushi, or even Haikyuu would probably thinkHowever, you sad emo pieces of trash who'd rather watch shows like Elfen Lied and Serial Experiments Lain most likely think sports anime is crap and is a terrible excuse of an anime. Well do I have news for you guys.That's right, I spent 2 entire days marathoning the five season and still ongoing show that is Teekyuu! Get ready for the ride of your lives.STORYThat synopsis doesn't the anime justice. I can tell you what Teekyuu is about in just one picture:That's right, it's...literally nothing. One moment they'll be going to the beach, the next they'll be in Cambodia getting sworn at.And another thing: the entire show is fast af. You think shows lasting 6 minutes is short? Try two freaking minutes and still managing to have an opening sequence. How do they do it? It's simple, it goes machspeed. If you blink once, you'll miss a whole joke. Teekyuu is truly a challenge for the experienced of otaku.CHARACTERSNow let's talk a bit about out four special snowflakesFirst off is Yuri Oshimoto, the only girl of the four that has a sense of sanity. Her purpose in the show is to watch over the other 3 like a human seat belt and make sure they don't end up as strippers on the side of the street. Every slapstick comedy needs a sane person to interject, and that's what Yuri is: a big giant interjection.Who here likes pink hair on a cute anime character? I sure do, your grandpappy sure dies*ahem*Does.So what happens when you put pink hair on a nittlebopper named Shijou?One spaztastic demigod on LSD.Yes, Nasuno is by far the most snazzy Himedere you've ever seen. Whether it be traveling by eagle, having the mascot of KFC as a father, or intimidating a baker to sell himself as a slave, Nasuno is most certainly a rich dumb blonde without the blonde. Also, she has a sort of relationship with Yuri's little brother. Nnnnnnng, I ship it hard.And now, the moment you've all been waiting for. That's right, we're about to talk about everyone's favorite character in all of existence. Yes, I introduce you to Mario Brando, I mean Marimo Bandou.Voiced by seiyuu Goddess Kana Hanazawa-sama, she's literally the reason half of the people who watched Teekyuu actually watched it. However, what many don't expect about Marimo is her personality.You ever watch an anime where a school girl gets confronted by an old, smelly, and hairy old man? That is Marimo. Legit talk, on a scale from 1 to 10 on pervertedness, Marimo is a 69.SOUNDThere's seriously nothing good about the music in Teekyuu. I applaud them for somehow managing to include it in their 2 minute time frame, but that's about it. Other than the season 4 opening, none of the others are worth mentioning.ANIMATIONNow hold onto your seats for this one guys. Strapped in? OkYou know the frames in Teekyuu? Yes, they're all done by a single guy. Pretty amazing, right? Considering you watched Shirobako, you can probably comprehend just how much work that really is. Because of that, it isn't necessarily fair to judge every single frame and compare it to studios like Madhouse or A-1 Steak Sauce. Yeah, he's that important.PERSONAL ENJOYMENTLet's be honest here guys: most of the time when there's a review of an anime on AA it's always positive. Well guess what?.....This will be the same ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) the 2 minute length can be a turnoff for a lot of people. By the way, don't try and watch Teekyuu on your TV, it takes hella long to finish buffering.I will also say that the jokes of Teekyuu were humorous and random, the kind of jokes that I live in a comedy anime. I had a good time watching this show since you can literally watch the entire 6 seasons in a day.OVERALLIf you'd like an extremely short and funny comedy anime to marathon with maximum retardation into the mix, Teekyuu is the show for you. My suggestions is to not focus on the sound and animation too much, as what really makes Teekyuu the bag of gags that it truly is are the jokes. You seriously don't have enough time to focus on everything in this show, so I suggest you simply try and keep up and remember: don't blink literally nothing.

The card game is played in a virtual battle. There isn't much to talk about the story more than this as this is just an itroductory episode. The animation is interesting and fun. Character design manages to look fesh.The sound design and soundtrack was easily the most attention...drawing feature of the episode. The music during one of the battle scenes was very good. Sota, the main character, is given a well enough background story. drawing feature of the episode. The music during one of the battle scenes was very good. Sota, the main character, is given a well enough background story."", ""I did not think card games and raves worked together, but I was mistaken.I value two things most of all - story and style. In the genre of TCG tie-in anime, there isn't a lot that can be done with the former. At the end of the day, tabletop gaming is a constraining plot structure. The simple solution, which Zenonzard has realised immediately, is to pull out all the stops on the latter.Not just the the field of play, but the audience, the stage, every single aspect that can have been brought over the top, has. The cast is colourful both in and out of...the game, the UIs are nicely modern and surprisingly legible, and even near-emotionless AI can give a ton of personality just through their excellent designs. It's literally astounding.----While the plot is nothing new, an absurdly popular card game exists that the protagonist plays, said protagonist does have a bit of interest behind him. Unlike other TCG characters, he does not initially want to play the eponymous game, despite his latent interest and history with it. It's a decent idea that I hope could be expanded upon in the full series.There were elements of an overarching subplot in the opening scene, but this does not get brought back within the duration of this prologue, though appear to be important in the sequel. I wouldn't say this scene helped as there is no conclusion to it, and may have been better suited for the rest of the show. The only annoyance really is that the rules of the card game are not explained other than a few brief comments of a side character, but I'm willing to let this be assuming explanations are done in the main series.----The art is, as stated, excellent. Even outside the game, the characters look really good, even the normal, mostly realistic designs of the students. The animation does wane a bit with the use of CGI, which can be very detrimental to some viewers but I thought worked well enough. The editing and direction are mostly normal but have standout moments with very impressive angles and shot setups, particularly during the climactic card game.The music is exceptional, and while used sparingly in the first half pays off tenfold in the second and the ED. The entire game is almost fully scored and synced with the music, and it really helps build excitement during each card play.The tone and design of the world itself is interesting, and has a lot of nice elements. The character designs fit in when necessary but are also able to be distinct enough, with each Codeman having a distinct palette and motif. Even background characters from The Zenon, each barely seen, have multiple interesting elements in their appearance.----Needless to say, Episode 0 has sold me on Zenonzard. I can't think of much that I think would improve it other than fully explaining the rules of the card game. Nevertheless, if the main series can keep the same flair and energy, I will certainly be invested. the game, the UIs are nicely modern and surprisingly legible, and even near-emotionless AI can give a ton of personality just through their excellent designs.

Sword Art Online: Extra Edition,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20021/Sword_Art_Online__Extra_Edition,"['Loved Sword Art Online so much that you want to see it again? Than this is the show for you... because essentially that is what this extra edition is - the same soundtrack, art, clips and even the opening song. Basically it is like most every OVA/""special episode""/or first film - the dreaded recap.Yes, I may come off as unnecessarily harsh but the fact is that very little new content is introduced in what is about a feature length film (~100 minutes) in regards to plot and character development. It starts of well though - Kirito has a ""special"" appointment with the counselor which seemed...like it had potential because, after all, being in game for almost three years is bound to have psychological effects. Nope, it\'s a government man coming to interrogate Kirito - again had the potential to be interesting because it could have examined the relationship between the players and Japan, or Kirito ""the gaming genius"" and the government. Nope, instead it\'s just a recap like the viewer\'s were idiots and didn\'t watch the last season. There is nothing new in Kirito\'s narration which, by the way, takes up the majority of the episode. The clips are taken directly from past episode\'s and the summary isn\'t even good, in fact they seem contrived. It just really feels like a bad filler episode. The whole thing is just recap, recap and more recaps - it gets tiring after awhile.As for the sideplot, well quite honestly this should have been called ""Swimsuit Art Online"" because almost the entire plot is well - cute girls in swimsuits with the flimsy excuse of ""well we have to teach Sugu to swim!"" There is plenty of fanservice shots that are none to discreet and this part of the plot feels as if we are in the classic harem show. Basically this ended up being the beach episode that we never got in the actual anime itself - fanservice with just a dash of plot.By the time the show even get\'s to Alfheim, the majority of the time has past so to preserve time, the ""quest"" is reduced to a mere slideshow, just a couple of stills. Without giving too much away, the actual story ends really anticlimactically - it’s all bark and no bite. Big names and creatures appear, but it’s all done without tension or consequence (Seriously, how can you make a fight against a Kraken AND a Leviathan, boring?)Because the music, animation is mostly the same, there\'s not much to say except Asuna looks bizarre.The fact was that with that much time so much could have been done - it could have been epic, could have explored the psychological effects on players, or examined the problems created in Japan. Instead it\'s: swimsuits, cute girls, and recaps, recaps and recaps. If that\'s your sorta thing, feel free - go for it. like it had potential because, after all, being in game for almost three years is bound to have psychological effects.

If that\'s your sorta thing, feel free - go for it.', ""First and foremost, if you ever plan on or have considered watching this special, I'm assuming you've seen the first season, otherwise, there's no real reason for you to be here. Because this is a special, my rating for it is not based on complete quality of the special on its own, but how the special relates to the first season. A special is an addendum to a series; it's like an extra episode. Keep that in mind while reading my review.Examining the special piece by piece, I will start with the basics: art and sound. As I mentioned before, if you're considering watching this...special, it's probably because you saw the first season and are interested in seeing similar content. I can assure you that the art and sound in the special is exactly as it was in the first season. Not even the opening theme is new. Simply put, your personal opinion on the art and sound of the first season is going to be identical to your opinion of the art and sound in the special. So because nothing has changed, these two factors can be ignored. The same goes for characters. None of them have changed, so expect nothing different from before.What really matters is the story, right? Yes. As far as specials go, I thought the story was, in a word, decent. Everything started off incredibly slow; the whole first half of the special was basically recapping some of the more important scenes in the first season with brief bits of character dialogue strewn around in between. It wouldn't surprise me if you said that that sounds horribly boring. You'd be right. It was horribly boring. I can't think of a single person that enjoys recap or flash backs. The only thing that kept everything at least somewhat interesting was the inclusion of some mild fan service. Which, I should specify, although it probably should have been obvious to you, is entirely female only. Having watched the first season, I'm sure you know that this is an anime tailored mostly for males or really anyone attracted to females; I say males because the only real canonical pairing is Kirito and Asuna which is obviously a straight relationship. All of this is to say, there is female fan service, so expect it and appreciate it if you want. Now, while the first half of the special is truly boring, the second wasn't so bad. The rest of the plot involves a quest in Alfheim in which all of your favorite characters take part. Of course before the actual quest begins, there is plenty more fan service. The quest itself isn't really all that interesting. It isn't exactly high stakes as some of the events and quests were in the first season. Overall the quest is laid back. We see some fighting, some humor, some dialogue; really everything you'd expect from a typical episode of really anything. It wasn't incredibly captivating, but everything sort of fit together enough for it to be pleasing.Looking at this special as a whole, I would say that it was pretty good. As you can probably see, I gave it a 7, which I think is a generous score, but not something it didn't deserve. It really and truly is an extra, fun episode involving the characters of Sword Art Online doing things you never got to see them do in the first season. If mundane events where nothing really happens don't appeal to you, I wouldn't bother watching it, otherwise I think it's at least worth the watch. special, it's probably because you saw the first season and are interested in seeing similar content.

If mundane events where nothing really happens don't appeal to you, I wouldn't bother watching it, otherwise I think it's at least worth the watch."", 'Now before you shoot me for rating it low...hear my reasoning.  This is intended for people who haven\'t seen it, it\'s my advice whether to watch it or not waste time watching it. It\'s ok if you liked it more than I, it\'s ok if you hated it more than I. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Here goes mine:First off, don\'t even think about watching this movie-length special before you have watched the series Sword Art Online if you planned to do it. Also, if you are somehow discouraged to view this movie by its huge flashback, it\'s all fine, I really...don\'t think it will become a key element between SAO S1 and SAO S2For a duration of 1hr 40 seconds, majority of this movie is a recap. The extra footage you might want to see is like, 20 minutes of end the show. Other than that it\'s mostly fanservice pieces and recapitulation of the previous season of Sword Art Online.In my opinion, it\'s kind of a waste of time to waste 1hr 20 mins on flashbacks. But hey, Season 2 of Sword Art Online is airing soon, so maybe it\'s the right time to reminiscence and nostalgizise. Might just ring your nostalgic wibes in the right momentThe last 20 minutes or so are extra footage. To avoid spoilers, I will just say: It was very inspiring. As someone who likes playing some MMORPGs and would like to make a MMORPG someday in the future (hopefully)  I was all like ""why are we not funding this"" because none of the MMORPGs i played so far have stuff even remotely as awesome like this. Just that very aspect was what I really liked about the movie.As the series, this movie feels like something to please younger audiences in pre/early-teenage years, judging by the plot development and depth. It\'s in no way hard to understand and feels simple - doesn\'t make one think too deep about it. Of course, it can also please audiences that would prefer action and don\'t like to think too deep about what happens in the anime. The plot piece in this anime is fairly simple and easy. It\'s really light-hearted, so if you are looking for something like that, shoot for Sword Art Online : Extra Edition!

Most of the movie is a summary of what happened during the Sword Art Online season. Many parts of the movie are simply taken from the seasons, so if you're looking for something completely new, this isn't really going to be your piece of the pie. The new underwater quest doesn't add to the storyline very much at all, but it is nice to have an episode that isn't so serious as the SAO series. Expect to watch at least an hour of recaps though.Art: 9Art is amazing as usual. Asuna gets...a new character design in ALO, so that's a major plus. Nothing to complain about here.Sound: 6Although I personally loved the music and effects from both the movie and the series, one of the major complaints against the sound was that it is very repetitive. This does not change in the movie, and some of the music used in the series is used once again in this movie. For creativity, the sound is not very much different, except for when the movie nears the end.Character: 7I liked the idea that they dove into Suguha's character more. It wasn't much, but it was a nice cherry on top that made this episode more than just a complete recap. As mentioned before, Asuna's character was changed up a bit, but her visual still looks just as beautiful.Enjoyment: 7Three-quarters of the movie are a pain to watch if you've already seen the series and begging for new things. However, the last 20 minutes are quite nice, featuring new battle scenes. I rate this episode as a lead-in to the new season, and the last 20 minutes do a nice job of this. The first hour and a half of boredom must be taken into account though, and thus it deserves no more than a 7.Overall, as a lead in to the next season, I think this movie did a good job. It's nothing fantastic, and the first hour and a half might be worth skipping, but the last 20 minutes of the movie is new, fresh, and underwater. Overall, about a 7. a new character design in ALO, so that's a major plus.

The main characters re-tell the events with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight in a relaxed atmosphere, which serves to further familiarize the viewer with the cast.  The flashbacks are well-edited and condensed and this Extra Edition is highly recommended for both newcomers to the franchise and old-timers alike.The story revolves around Kirito retelling his story to an investigator, giving an insight into his psychological state and thought processes during his time in-game....For the rest of his friends, they reminince how they first met Kirito, which further exemplifies the way they behaved at the time.  If this does not put the ""typical harem, piece of rubbish"" detractors to rest, then it is simply inconceivable how these people derive any sort of satisfaction in life.  For the Extra Edition grants a more than adequate, in fact a flawless, excellent explanation behind the characters.After the recap segment, the main cast set off on a quest in ALO where A-1 Pictures diversifies in it\'s method of narrative.  A combination of extensive battle animation and teamwork followed by economical but effective still frames is highly commendable, for MMORPGs are repetitive in nature.  This is because a direct ""adaptation"" of a MMORPG into an anime would be a lot of battle-grinding boredom.  Again, the battles are combined with ingenius character reflection which only serves to develop the viewers\' bond and linkage with the cast.Combined with the realistic metal sword effects and the strong, compelling soundtrack by Kajiura Yuki and the previous OP/ED songs being used as inserts, the viewer is not let down in the audio department either.  I can only wish that the highly-acclaimed video game ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" had battle sounds that was anywhere near as compelling as SAO, but it is hard for anything to match the high bar which this franchise sets.The only downside is the relatively low resolution and detailing of the art.  Having watched shows by SHAFT in recent days, the detailing does not come close at all to SHAFT\'s standards.  Although this may be because A-1 Pictures decided to actually animate, unlike SHAFT\'s excessive usage of budget-stretching still frames.Overall the Extra Edition combines a great cast with compelling characterization.  Despite much of it being a recap, the story has a completely fresh perspective which has much to add.  Sword Art Online: Extra Edition is definitely not to be missed.P.s. I am surprised by the striking coincidence involving the naming of Sakuya the Undine and Alicia the Cait Sith in this franchise.  For these terminologies remind me of a moe-pandering so-called ""slice of life"" anime which is called Aria that uses words of the same name.  This is a series which must be never watched, for it features deadpan, one-line catchphrasing characters in stark contrast with the compelling characterization of SAO: Extra Edition.  Any attempt at ""plot"" is simply horribly contrived and the enlightened MAL community of connoisseurs must make every effort to avoid such monstrosity.

I wont spoil, but the circumstances of the recap could have been done in the first 15 minutes or so, leaving the majority of the feature lenght for the little adventure they had at the end, and I would have appreciated that so much moreIll give...it some credit for bringing a few things out during that lengthy recap, but spending 90 minutes on stuff I already watched was less interesting than relearning your ABCs with Sesame Street -.-Its not all bad tho, there is actually some Novelty, but its about the last 15 or 20 minutes, so go watch that, its much closer to what I expected from SAO, and if it was just that part I would have rated it much higher... but all in all, im very disappointed that it felt like such a waste it some credit for bringing a few things out during that lengthy recap, but spending 90 minutes on stuff I already watched was less interesting than relearning your ABCs with Sesame Street -.-Its not all bad tho, there is actually some Novelty, but its about the last 15 or 20 minutes, so go watch that, its much closer to what I expected from SAO, and if it was just that part I would have rated it much higher... but all in all, im very disappointed that it felt like such a waste', ""Just like a great amount of people, when I heard that season 2 of Sword Art Online was finally announced, I was hyped. Heck, I still am while writing this review. With the end of the year approaching fast, Crunchyroll treated us with a subbed version of Sword Art Online: Extra Edition, and I couldn't wait to watch it. Even though I knew it was going to be a recap episode, it's a nice thing to get back into the whole anime again, that had both upsides and downsides. And don't forget the extra footage, of course.So, to start off: Yes, like I said before,...this is mostly a recap episode. Especially the first hour consists of mostly flashbacks with new footage inbetween. The short synopsis in MAL pretty much explains the entire special, so all in all, there's not much to say about this in overall. We have our main characters, and a returning character that I believe has never shown his face in the first season. The new footage seems to come with some new music as well, and we get to see the side characters from the first arc in their ALfheim form for longer than a minute, which is pretty neat.The animation and art are pretty much the same as the original anime, with here and there some slight changes in lighting and whatnot, but barely noticeable. What is noticeable are the characteristics of our main characters. It's now far more obvious that they've grown up a bit more, which wasn't that clear at the end of the first season. Along that is a bit of character development, at least as much as it could allow with the given time in between the flashbacks, along with a new flashback not shown in the original anime.For SAO fans, this is a must-watch, especially if you haven't seen the anime in a while. For newcomers, don't think this special will get you up to date, as it clearly leaves out very important parts of the original and is only meant to spark the memories of the fans, and nothing more. Along with the new extras, Sword Art Online: Extra Edition is a fun watch, and a great special to end the year with. And of course, with the announcement of the second season, you just can't help but feel even more hyped after having watched this.A Happy New Year to everyone, and may your 2014 be filled with lovely memories, and some great anime to accompany it with. Akemashite omedetou! this is mostly a recap episode. Especially the first hour consists of mostly flashbacks with new footage inbetween.

Akemashite omedetou!"", 'If you have never seen Sword Art Online I recommend you stop reading at the second paragraph (discounting this passage) since I go into spoiler territory past that. Using specific examples of important events in the series to prove a point on how badly this recap movie present the material. By the second paragraph I generalize the main issues without spoiling anything specific. I might not think the series is great, but I wouldn’t dare ruin the element of surprise for anyone seeing it for the first time if they choose to do so.The anime Sword Art Online is a fluctuating experience. The story was...stupid breaking its own logic, not understanding how video game programming worked and filled with some idiotic characters, yet it was for those exact reasons I kept watching it. Part of the appeal of watching Sword Art Online is that it was always entertaining no matter what happened. Whether it was good or bad there was something to go back to. Something this recap film fails to emulate in the same way and serves to further highlights season one weaknesses while barely displaying of the strengths it had in the series.So in order to save both fans and newcomers time this film is basically a bad recap of the first season of Sword Art Online that lasts an hour and forty minutes. In the first  hour and twenty minutes there is some new footage mostly of characters sitting and talking, but pale in comparison to the usage of clips from the series first season. The remaining twenty minute is spent on a subplot involving Kirito and the gang exploring an underwater dungeon in Alfheim Online. For fans of the series I wouldn’t recommend seeing this film for the new material since like a character said in a scene before this movie ended it’s unimportant.The way more than of half of the film is set up is like an interview. A government official, Kikuoka Seijirou, wants some dangling questions regarding the Sword Art Online and Alfheim Online incidents cleared up. Despite Kitiro expressing that he told them (the government) like a million time what happened. Within the first couple of minutes this simple exchange of dialogue expresses how pointless it is for both Kirito and anyone who seen the series to go over what happened. While Kirto talks to Kikuoka Seijirou there’s a subplot involving Asuna, Keiko, and Rika teaching Suguha how to swim. This framing device among the girls provides some character moments with them commenting on each other story on how they met Kirito. It’s not a bad framing device even if the girls remain in swimsuits for most of the non-recap clips. Compare to Kirito narrative framing which adds nothing. The girls framing device provides the rare interaction between characters in the real world.One thing that is fixed in the movie are certain plot holes aren’t made as noticeable in the film. In the first season of Sword Art Online it was established in episode two that beta testers were passing out guide books so non-experience players can learn how to play the game. Including clearly stating a couple of months has passed and people will in real life die if they die in the game. Apparently death is not a good motivation for some players to learn how to play the game.  With that bit of information left out it managed to make the whole scenario come across grimer and make the players look less idiotic in comparison to the anime series. This is later counteracted when the film has Kikuoka Seijirou asking how Kirito he survived in Sword in Art Online despite it going against the video game programing. Kirito ignores giving any sort of logical answer. Simply put, he survived death by sheer willpower.It does this on another important occasion including the cardinal sin of not showing what happened when Kirito faces Sugou Nobuyuki in the Alfheim Online arc. Before giving a flimsy explanation one of the last thing seen is Sugou about to seemingly rape Asuna in front of Kirito. After Kayaba appears to give Kirito a motivation speech, it cuts back to Kirito talking to Kikuoka. The only explanation that’s given regarding what happened to Sogou is he self destructed. Not exactly satisfactory when it’s casually resolved like that. I could only imagine how fed up non-viewers of the series might feel when seeing that.For some reason Shigeru Nishiyama (the film and anime series editor) thought it was a good idea to cut out certain things for no reason. Near the end of episode ten when Kirito goes over to Asuna house there’s a misunderstanding. In the scene, Asuna finishes undressing after diner mistaking Kirito intentions, thinking he wanted to have sex with her when actually he just wanted to stay the night at her place. Kirito clears up the misunderstanding which intentional or not was a hilarious moment in the anime. In the movie, once Asuna finishes undressing and tells Kirito to take off his clothes it cuts to black. Fading into the two of them sleeping together in bed. So according to this movie both Kirito and Asuna had sex.Another mishaps by editor Shigeru Nishiyama is how he presented Yui story in the film. This piece in the movie is terribly edited together with noticeable abrupt cuts that even non viewers of the series would be able tell had content cut out. Instead of showing at least a single scene of Kirito and Asuna bonding with Yui it just immediately goes to Yui telling the viewer what she is and then possibly dying. Not even the anime was as rush in the same way when presenting this storyline. Unless you have seen the anime this moment will leave viewers confused and with so many questions that won’t get answered.There’s also a random cut where Yui is around the same size as Kirito in Alfheim when Kirito enters Alfheim Online for the first time. Later in that moment the next cut shows Yui in pixie size. There was no point in cutting out Yui shrinking herself within the same scene which by doing so also cut out the explanation Yui gives for still being alive in the video game. Why this was cut makes no sense.A shared element of both the film and anime series is Asuna getting the short end of characterization. Like in the anime, Asuna personality is no different than a thin piece of paper with boobs drawn on. However, it’s not presented in the same manner. The film doesn’t introduce Asuna as a capable player which in turn makes her role in the story less of an issue. Her role does not receive a downgrade in the film, which is a slight improvement to how she’s presented in the anime. Unfortunately the movie does not make a good case for Asuna being the center of Kirito affection. In the movie she’s just presented as an another girl who fallen in love with Kirito on a whim.Suguha on the other hand is presented as having an actual relationship with Kirito. Unlike the other girls, Suguha is the only one who is shown having a conflict with Kirito and solving it with him. Suguha side of the story paints her in a better light showing the rough side of her relationship not just the good moments. Just like in the anime, Suguha is the only female character who gets any good characterization in the movie. She’s the only character in the movie who has a conflict to overcome from the beginning of the movie all the way to the end. It’s not much characterization that gets added to her, but it is far more significant than what the rest of the cast gets. Nothing.Music while good gets replaced or amped up version from the anime series. The most noticeable is when it splices both of Kirito attempts to conquer the world tree in Alfheim Online it uses “Innocence” by Aoi Eir for those scenes. This specific track is not as effective as the original track use in the series. For the most part, the soundtrack is thankfully untouched. While not good enough to stand on its own without the help of the anime visual it works just fine in the movie as it did the series. There were times I will admit the music did get me to forget the issues I had and got me to enjoy what I was watching. Also, there were times where the editing would use a track to unintentional comedic effect. Simply cutting or fading out at a bad time. The voice work for both the Japanese and English cast is similar to the anime series. If you want more emotional performances watch it with English subtitles or if you want subtlety (and no stuttering) albeit with some underplayed characters go with the English dub. Unfortunately for both cast, it feels like rehash performances.The last twenty minutes contains all new footage and stills without splicing any footage from the anime. It’s a simple subplot of Kirito and the gang exploring an underwater dungeon. If it wasn’t included in the film the material would have been just fine released as an OVA. The new material in the last twenty minute is decent as a whole. As usual, despite playing an MMO and how they are actually design Kirito is able to handle any situation virtually by himself. What the new material does get right is capturing the fun experience from the series. The humor is intact and the interaction between the characters prevents thing from being boring. Where it stumbles is the new material is not entirely animated. There’s some action oriented stills which would have made up for the disappointing climax at the end of the movie. Setting up what seems like would be a cool action scene, only to have an outside force and one-shot character fix everything. I can’t forget how easy it was to figure out the identity of the NPC giving the quest. Surely a better name than Nerakk for an NPC could have been more clever to hide the true identity for English speakers. Just change around a couple of letters and you can solve what the NPC actually is.This movie is pointless offering only twenty minutes of new material, but even with that new material it is pointless. Aside from Suguha getting a small bit of new characterization nothing significant is added. Failing to condense the material of the first season of Sword Art Online and getting it to work in a movie format. The one to blame for this terrible piece of a film is not the source material since in the anime it does have good scenes that work in favor of the story, but the editing and the way the film presents them is too blame. It was sloppy, rushed, forgetting about the tiniest details like showing what happened to Sugou for a resolution. Instead of at least being a pleasant walk down memory lane it come across as a waste of time. There isn’t enough new footage to recommend to fans and it’s not a good presentation of the series for newcomers. You’re simply better off just watching the anime series or reading the light novels. No matter how they turned out, they at least will offer a complete experience unlike this film. stupid breaking its own logic, not understanding how video game programming worked and filled with some idiotic characters, yet it was for those exact reasons I kept watching it. Part of the appeal of watching Sword Art Online is that it was always entertaining no matter what happened. Whether it was good or bad there was something to go back to.

Unfortunately the movie does not make a good case for Asuna being the center of Kirito affection. In the movie she’s just presented as an another girl who fallen in love with Kirito on a whim.Suguha on the other hand is presented as having an actual relationship with Kirito. Unlike the other girls, Suguha is the only one who is shown having a conflict with Kirito and solving it with him. Suguha side of the story paints her in a better light showing the rough side of her relationship not just the good moments. Just like in the anime, Suguha is the only female character who gets any good characterization in the movie. She’s the only character in the movie who has a conflict to overcome from the beginning of the movie all the way to the end. It’s not much characterization that gets added to her, but it is far more significant than what the rest of the cast gets. Nothing.Music while good gets replaced or amped up version from the anime series. The most noticeable is when it splices both of Kirito attempts to conquer the world tree in Alfheim Online it uses “Innocence” by Aoi Eir for those scenes. This specific track is not as effective as the original track use in the series. For the most part, the soundtrack is thankfully untouched. While not good enough to stand on its own without the help of the anime visual it works just fine in the movie as it did the series. There were times I will admit the music did get me to forget the issues I had and got me to enjoy what I was watching. Also, there were times where the editing would use a track to unintentional comedic effect. Simply cutting or fading out at a bad time. The voice work for both the Japanese and English cast is similar to the anime series. If you want more emotional performances watch it with English subtitles or if you want subtlety (and no stuttering) albeit with some underplayed characters go with the English dub. Unfortunately for both cast, it feels like rehash performances.The last twenty minutes contains all new footage and stills without splicing any footage from the anime. It’s a simple subplot of Kirito and the gang exploring an underwater dungeon. If it wasn’t included in the film the material would have been just fine released as an OVA. The new material in the last twenty minute is decent as a whole. As usual, despite playing an MMO and how they are actually design Kirito is able to handle any situation virtually by himself. What the new material does get right is capturing the fun experience from the series. The humor is intact and the interaction between the characters prevents thing from being boring. Where it stumbles is the new material is not entirely animated. There’s some action oriented stills which would have made up for the disappointing climax at the end of the movie. Setting up what seems like would be a cool action scene, only to have an outside force and one-shot character fix everything. I can’t forget how easy it was to figure out the identity of the NPC giving the quest. Surely a better name than Nerakk for an NPC could have been more clever to hide the true identity for English speakers. Just change around a couple of letters and you can solve what the NPC actually is.This movie is pointless offering only twenty minutes of new material, but even with that new material it is pointless. Aside from Suguha getting a small bit of new characterization nothing significant is added. Failing to condense the material of the first season of Sword Art Online and getting it to work in a movie format. The one to blame for this terrible piece of a film is not the source material since in the anime it does have good scenes that work in favor of the story, but the editing and the way the film presents them is too blame. It was sloppy, rushed, forgetting about the tiniest details like showing what happened to Sugou for a resolution. Instead of at least being a pleasant walk down memory lane it come across as a waste of time. There isn’t enough new footage to recommend to fans and it’s not a good presentation of the series for newcomers. You’re simply better off just watching the anime series or reading the light novels. No matter how they turned out, they at least will offer a complete experience unlike this film.', 'What a masterpiece. As expected of the legendary SAO series, one of the greatest animes of all time. Where other series would make a boring clip show of scenes from the previous season as a lazy cash grab, A-1 Pictures in a brilliant move makes a recap film that is enticing and able to captivate the audience. The shock as i saw many low ratings only lasted a short while, as I remembered the complexity of SAOs brilliance that makes it hard for the average anime watcher to understand and simply fly over their head. A must watch for all SAO fans or people with...a high enough intelligence to comprehend its glory.Also nice tits. a high enough intelligence to comprehend its glory.Also nice tits.', ""Happy New Years, everyone! To summarize this review, the first 80 minutes are flashbacks while the last 20 are a decent new bit. Also, People who take offense to stuff people say on the Internet are idiots.If you are wondering whether you should watch this, ask yourself this question: Do you really want to relive this shit again? If your answer was a “Yes” in any way, shape or form, man, you are some serious masochist and really should be rethinking your life choices. It made me rethink my life choices, I mean like, why am I watching this and not Monster, Legend of the...Galactic Heroes or Ghost in the Shell like all those pretentious hipster critics want me to? At any rate, this 100 minute special drowns you in 80 minutes of flashbacks to those terrible times, with special attention given to the deus ex machina moments and the horribly forced teen romance. They give you only short breaths of toxic, polluted air in between with new footage of Kirito’s harem in bathing suits talking about how much of a Gary Stu Kirito is or how good Asuna is at making sandwiches :)You are better off skipping the flashbacks so I’ll summarize what happens during the first 80 minutes in this paragraph. If you really are a masochist and want to watch them for yourself or you don’t quite remember what happened in the show due to mental trauma, skip to the next paragraph. Basically, Kirito’s harem (Asuna, Silica, the blacksmith girl who’s name I don’t remember and Kirito’s sister) are at the pool teaching Kirito’s sister how to swim (how cute, the strong and athletic little sister needs help) while they discuss their experiences with Kirito. Meanwhile, Kirito is meeting Kikuoka Seijirou, the government official in charge of virtual reality incidents, and he's recounting what happened in SAO and ALO, covering everything that the girls don’t.The last twenty minutes or so are decent for some light-hearted action and fun. There are some funny moments and they don’t try to take themselves *too* seriously. The plot is good... for an MMORPG, though anyone who’s played an MMORPG should know how terrible the average MMORPG quest storyline is. I was sorely disappointed that there was no final epic boss fight. Instead, they wasted their time with some crappy brother-sister drama (along with a random flashback to further emphasize how amazing Kirito was for being a hero even when he was a little kid), and, as always, they show that no one can do shit without our invincible protagonist. Nevertheless, one IS able to feel or imagine a bit of how amazing it would be to play a VRMMORPG and how incredibly huge ALO must be to find such incredible areas relatively untouched.Characters, if this is even possible, were even worse than in Sword Art Online considering how they made all the girls just weak little damsels who fell heads over heels for our antisocial nerd of a chick magnet and all they do is talk about him. I really don’t get how they don’t give up and give Kirito and Asuna their space, all they are doing is pointlessly interfering into Kirito and Asuna’s relationship though I wouldn’t be surprised if the series ended in a sixsome (or sexsome, kukukuku, since a new girl is introduced in GGO). Kirito’s as much of a Gary Stu as ever, Klein just becomes your perverted comic relief best friend character rather than the strong caring man he was in SAO and Agil doesn’t really deserve a mention here since he didn’t really do anything or interact with the other characters.The music score is excellent, obviously since it’s done by Yuki Kajiura, though some of it is reused from the original SAO (and of course, during the flashbacks they use the same soundtrack), while the theme song by Eir Aoi is great as well. The art is as good as ever with vibrant and colorful backdrops and sunsets that truly drop you into the beautiful world of ALfheim.Overall, the OVA was fine, but I really wish I didn’t waste my time watching the flashbacks. The OVA ends with a hint of the upcoming Sword Art Online 2 and I will foolishly cling onto the non-existent hope that they will learn from their mistakes and present us with an at least decent anime. The next arc is probably the best so far in the light novel series, so let us all pray that they don’t utterly butcher it.

This hour and forty minute special isn't too bad if you skip all the recap, so I will be mainly reviewing everything that isn't a recap of this special, since honestly, the special wasn't too bad.Story: 6Kirito and Asuna are trying to fufil the wish of Yui, to go see a whale.  Rumors are that there is a quest far away in where a whale will appear, but it turns out Kirito's sister can't swim.  While the girls teach Kirito's sister how to swim...in real life, Kirito has to tell that story of both SAO and ALO to a person who works for some government facility regarding virtual reality gaming.  As I said before, if you ignore the recap, the special isn't too bad...The pacing of the special was fine, a bit fast, but nothing to stress about.  The ending felt very anti-climatic for what SAO has done with other enemies.  What started off looking very epic ended up being a total blowout.  Two problems I also had with this story, why couldn't they just abandon Kirito's sister and just do the quest?  Also, couldn't they teach her in the game?Art: 8The art was nice, great character outfits for all of the cast.  I especially loved Asuna's ALO (That blue and white...).  Scenery looked great and so did the sea temple.  Monster designs weren't too bad, felt a bit more like Digimon than normal monsters that belonged to ALO but no complaints.  Action scenes were fluid, something that SAO was always good with.Sound: 9SAO has always had a great soundtrack, and the new OP, Niji no Oto was great.  With use of both Crossing Field and INNOCENCE was a great touch to introduce the recap.  The ED, Yume Sekai, wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it on my iTunes.The background music was the same as the ones used in the first season SAO.  It was enjoyable, with a bit of nostalgia feel, since I enjoyed my first watch through of the series.Character: 6The characters didn't really develop much throughout this special.  The only one who showed little development was Suguha because she learned how to swim, but that isn't the character development that people are looking for.It was nice to see Lizbeth and Silica again, as those characters didn't get too much time during the first season, and I really enjoyed their presence throughout the special.  Yui was super cute riding on Silica's dragon.Enjoyment: 7I quite enjoyed this special, partly because I skipped through everything recap.  I really wished the last fight was going to be more epic, instead of the anti-climatic ending it had.  I typically dislike straight fan service, but the special didn't do too much of it, I was expecting WAY more.Overall: 7I believe the only goal for this extra was to hype the fans for season two by recapping the first season.  Knowing that not a lot of people wouldn't want to watch a recap, they combined an OVA with the recap and made an hour and forty minute mess.  This sorta got me hyped for a season two, but Konno Yuuki has me more hyped as there maybe a chance for her to get animated. in real life, Kirito has to tell that story of both SAO and ALO to a person who works for some government facility regarding virtual reality gaming.

They definitely don\'t have the best story or characters by any chance, but still manages to be incredibly enjoyable. Although reading the light novels do help with this, since the series does feel rushed. I really don\'t know how they do it.Keep in mind that you should watch the original SAO before watching this series.I came into SAO:Extra knowing it would probably have many flaws, but still eagerly awaited its livestream. It\'s sorta like cocaine.Story: 4/10This 2 hour special involves 1 hour and 40 minutes of recaps from the original series, showing past events...through flashbacks from various characters. I must say even though I have watched those scenes before, it was still enjoyable. You can hardly account that as a story though.However, through those flashbacks and reflections we did get to see some emotions and feelings of some characters in specific scenes which we did not get in the original series. These emotions were described in the light novel, but the anime (which had a very rushed feeling throughout) missed it out. An example is Asuna\'s recaps on how she first met Kirito, and what she was feeling during the events that unfolded. A nice addition for people who haven\'t read the light novel, or people who really like scenes that just tell you character\'s feelings instead of leaving you to guess or intepret.The final 20 minutes brought a new, original story although I can tell you, it isn\'t much. I hate deus ex machinas and crappy endings with a passion. With that in mind, the ending is a shitfest of old nappies and dog poo, cos, it\'s just bad.Keeping in spoiler-free, it involves a badass boss fight which is just beginning, when some other NPC boss comes in and tells the other dude to fuck off, end of movie.I\'m not joking.Art: 9/10I enjoyed the art of the original SAO, so naturally the art here is spot-on here too. Mizugi errwhere to bring in the 12 year olds.Nothing else much to say here. A lot of scenes were cut directly from the original, but the new scenes have a ""real-world"" setting so it\'s not like you can see Asuna in her KoB uniform or anything.I mentioned Asuna a lot huehuehuehueSound: 7/10Giving it a 7 because there is only 1 new song for this special, which plays at the end. Definitely good enough to download, but because the show that went with it was not as effective, it didn\'t leave much of an impression. Lots of reuse of crossing field, overfly, innocence and yume sekai.Character: 7/10All the characters fill their respective personalities well, with some variances (since they\'re living in the real world now anyway). Asuna in the real world is very mature and composed, which gives you an idea of how she lives when she\'s not in a death game (lul, talking bout Asuna again).There was quite a lot of development of Lizbeth\'s character. She\'s actually quite a fun and teasing character which is enjoyable to watch. We didn\'t see that much in the original show, she was sort of just there for another girl that wants Kirito\'s D (must be fucking gold in there).Kayaba Akihiko is a character that always fascinated me, and the recaps resparked my interest in the philosophical views regarding the morality of treating sentient AI-units as humans or computers, the theological views on God and man relationships, and the psyche which Kayaba had which made him create the death game world that he did.Enjoyment: 10/10SAO always does this to me. A show with many flaws but still a highly enjoyable and beautiful journey. I love the scenario, story and characters no matter how cliche and Mary Sue it was. I love delving into the philosophical outlook on the repercussions in an alternate society, and Kirito and Asuna are always enjoyable to watch (esp. Asuna)Overall: 7/10Just like MAL captions, it is ""good"". The story is not so much ""needed"", but is a great addition for fans.

So if you do not want to flashback and a little fanservice, you can skip to the end. ', ""This episode wasn't exactly what I wished for. Most of it is just a summarization of the previous 25 episodes. If a person were to watch this before watching the whole anime, I think the summary episode was slightly too vague and included unnecessary parts. It wasn't half bad, but I wished the movie was a separate story. The last 20-40 minutes was adventure, which wasn't bad either. I like the anime, but this extra edition wasn't the best. :P "", ""Before people start bashing this I thought I would write just a little something. Yes this episode is mostly about flashbacks of all the old episode BUT if you read the light novel (like a good fan should) this event of Kazuto speaking with the man from the ministry of internal affairs did happen but it occurred in a cafe ( if I remember correctly) that Kazuto agreed to meet him at. I think that this extra episode was a great way to incorporate the events of the light novel in a way that wasn't just watching the two of them exchanging this conversation. Although...the whale part was not part of the novels it was a good way to give the fans a chance to see all the characters they know and love all together in one episode as well as prepare then for what is to come in the future of the SAO series. SPOILER: At the very end of this extra edition, Kazuto is shown getting an incoming call that can be meant to be leading into the next season of SAO; which is Gun Gale online. This episode served as a refresher for the series to transition into what may be to come in my opinion since I can't say for certain what their plans are. the whale part was not part of the novels it was a good way to give the fans a chance to see all the characters they know and love all together in one episode as well as prepare then for what is to come in the future of the SAO series.

Pool? Well, just the female characters. Too bad Kirito is stuck telling his flashbacks to an investigator somewhere else. At least the viewers get to enjoy the girls in swimsuits as they teach Sugu how to swim and talk about their own memories of meeting Kirito inside SAO.Story: 7/10A large part of this special is just flashbacks told from the characters' point of view. As far as the story goes, Kirito...is persuaded to relieve the events of SAO for investigative purposes, while the girls get to frolic around in the pool and also reminisce about how they first met Kirito. The last half hour or so is original content; everybody goes into ALO to do an underwater quest. It's nothing special, no death trap, but still enjoyable for any fan of this series.Art: 8/10This anime series has always had excellent art quality and beautiful background scenery inside the game. A lot of it is recycled from the flashbacks but in the quest we get to see a whole new underwater world too. And of course, as the pool/beach episode, there is no shortage of the female characters in swimming attire. It's all pretty cute.Sound: 9/10The soundtrack from the original series makes an impressive reappearance in Extra Edition, starting with Crossing Field as the opening theme. The other opening and ending themes for both arcs are inserted during the most important flashbacks, which was done very effectively to highlight them. There are also new songs (insert and ending) which are pretty good.Character: 9/10Honestly, I feel that most SAO fans are just pleased to see their favorite characters back in action, be it having fun at the pool, going on the quest, or playfully chatting with each other. Since the recaps are told by each character, we get to hear the character commentary as well as dialogue between characters in the present. Silica & Lizbeth teasing Asuna about Kirito, everyone being jealous of Sugu's chest, Silica worrying about her own, etc. This kind of episode won't have much character development except the typical romance and pool cliches. Except Klein: I didn't know he was such a doomed womanizer.Enjoyment: 9/10I really enjoyed this type of episode. As I said before, we get to see all the characters again, in a relaxed atmosphere free of all the pressure and drama so rampant in the 25 episode series. This allows us to see them in a different light as they do everything for fun instead of to survive. It's a welcome relief episode with a lot more comedy. Now, people typically dislike recaps because they may be redundant, but fortunately these flashbacks were mostly action/turning point scenes. It would not hurt to watch them (and then hear the characters' witty comments).Overall: 9/10An excellent recap/pool/fun special episode with a way different mood from the other 25 episodes. Nobody's in trouble and the world doesn't need saving, so everyone can sit back and enjoy themselves after their grueling adventure earlier. And then get ready for the next season of Sword Art Online! is persuaded to relieve the events of SAO for investigative purposes, while the girls get to frolic around in the pool and also reminisce about how they first met Kirito. The last half hour or so is original content; everybody goes into ALO to do an underwater quest. It's nothing special, no death trap, but still enjoyable for any fan of this series.Art: 8/10This anime series has always had excellent art quality and beautiful background scenery inside the game. A lot of it is recycled from the flashbacks but in the quest we get to see a whole new underwater world too. And of course, as the pool/beach episode, there is no shortage of the female characters in swimming attire. It's all pretty cute.Sound: 9/10The soundtrack from the original series makes an impressive reappearance in Extra Edition, starting with Crossing Field as the opening theme. The other opening and ending themes for both arcs are inserted during the most important flashbacks, which was done very effectively to highlight them. There are also new songs (insert and ending) which are pretty good.Character: 9/10Honestly, I feel that most SAO fans are just pleased to see their favorite characters back in action, be it having fun at the pool, going on the quest, or playfully chatting with each other. Since the recaps are told by each character, we get to hear the character commentary as well as dialogue between characters in the present. Silica & Lizbeth teasing Asuna about Kirito, everyone being jealous of Sugu's chest, Silica worrying about her own, etc. This kind of episode won't have much character development except the typical romance and pool cliches. Except Klein: I didn't know he was such a doomed womanizer.Enjoyment: 9/10I really enjoyed this type of episode. As I said before, we get to see all the characters again, in a relaxed atmosphere free of all the pressure and drama so rampant in the 25 episode series. This allows us to see them in a different light as they do everything for fun instead of to survive. It's a welcome relief episode with a lot more comedy. Now, people typically dislike recaps because they may be redundant, but fortunately these flashbacks were mostly action/turning point scenes. It would not hurt to watch them (and then hear the characters' witty comments).Overall: 9/10An excellent recap/pool/fun special episode with a way different mood from the other 25 episodes. Nobody's in trouble and the world doesn't need saving, so everyone can sit back and enjoy themselves after their grueling adventure earlier. And then get ready for the next season of Sword Art Online!"", 'This is just recap of Sword Art Online with some fan service thrown in.The first half is basically the whole series with same visuals. There is only a small new story at the end where the characters from the SAO do a small mission and even that is not that interesting at all. Total disappointment. ', ""Months after watching SAO, I found out that there was a movie. I got excited since I loved watching SAO. After watching the movie, I was like WTF? This is the movie? Whatever, here's my review.Story:I don't know what to say. I was dissapointed. It felt like a normal episode added with recaps.Art/Animation: It's the same as SAO. Beautiful and colorful.Sound: There was only 1 new soundtrack added in the movie but everything is recycled from the anime. It didn't really bother me since I love SAO's soundtrackCharacter: Same characters with the same personality.Enjoyement: This was basically just a recap of the past episodes...with new scenes added. I felt like I wasted 1 hr and 30 mins of my life.Overall 5/10I really don't see any reason why they made this movie. It's just a recap.

Complete with flashbacks and mindless, fanservice-filled endeavors, this is truly made for fans of the anime that want to reminisce over everything for an hour or so. I, on the other hand, prefer The Lion King ½ for this sort of thing.I guess the point of this, being a special consisted mostly of flashbacks, is to be relaxing and fun, and to not necessarily have much of a story. Kirito mainly gets asked about what happened in the online worlds that he was in during the course...of Sword Art Online. This makes for many flashback clips, all of which we've seen and remember - but, again, for avid lovers of SAO, this may seem enjoyable.A small and fairly cute underlying story takes place during the last 30 minutes or so. There is some added fun and fanservice between the flashbacks - mostly just buildup to more excuses for flashbacks. The overall enjoyment of these parts is actually not too bad, but mostly I felt that the experience was tarnished by me getting bored.With the art being practically the same as it was in Sword Art Online, it is top of the line, and the animation is enjoyable. The characters are looking their best in their swimsuits, so... Well done in this department.I've always enjoyed the music. However, after over an hour and a half of watching, it becomes repetitive. There's nothing much new added, except near the end. I enjoyed those songs - they are, of course, well done.And the characters. What to say? Barely anything changes about them, but we do get more info on Suguha, which is definitely a plus for me; it was nice to see some more depth. There is also some explanation on why they did the things that they did. Otherwise, everyone is the same as before, but I did find them a little more bearable - and it is fun how they interacted with one another.Enjoyment-wise, Sword Art Online: Extra Edition bored me exponentially at many points - I didn't have too much interest in the flashbacks. I wouldn't even call this more than just a recap with an added episode mixed in.Just good enough for killing time. I recommend this for fans of the series, but otherwise, you might just want to skip most of the flashbacks, condensing this into 40-45 minutes or so.

SAO: Extra Edition is almost entirely one long recap, using the debatable technique of cast commentary to make an attempt at giving viewers something fresh, with a little something at the end for the people who are here for more than just a refresher course on everything that happened during the series.The movie itself starts out promising, with the gang discussing a big quest in ALO, and the girls hanging out at the pool while Kirito is called in for a surprise counselling session. We get fanservice, and meet a new minor character, but all this is...quickly swept aside as the recap of the series begins with a vengeance, with an hour and a half of revisiting the important moments of the show, with the characters (mostly the girls) commentating on the action. While no doubt there are some people who are just happy to get more Asuna/Liz/Leafa/Kirito, most viewers will find revisiting all the already memorable moments of the anime to be tedious at best. When the movie's story finally picks up again later, the new content we were promised feels boring, short, and hastily put together, like a badly written fanfiction offered as a reward for sitting through the recap more than anything else. Even worse, for all of the KiritoxAsuna/Liz/anyone-he's-not-related-to fans, the character with the most spotlight is Suguha, whose one-sided relationship with Kirito upstages even Asuna.Besides story, the characterization is lacking as well. Not because of the characters themselves, who are all absolutely fantastic. Rather, it's the lack of any real character development or meaningful screen time that brings it down. While it's great to see the gang interacting together in the offline world, most of the characters are largely relegated to background roles this time, with Suguha getting most of the spotlight, with a bit of room left over for Yui and Kirito.The art itself is also fairly poorly done, and feels horribly under budget. While the recap moments are as beautiful as when we first saw them, and the pool scene is as good as can be expected from blatant fanservice, the actual fresh content shows an egregious lack of the scenery porn that was one of the draws of the show itself, with relatively bland and uninspired visuals that along with the aforementioned terrible writing make the fresh content almost as tedious to sit through as the recap.On a positive note, the music department at least doesn't fail to please. With more work from the amazing Yuki Kajiura, the soundtrack is easily the best part of the movie, which would be saying more if it wasn't the only good part as well.SAO Extra Edition could have been so much more, and an amazing addition to the animated version of the story. Unfortunately insufferably long recaps, terrible writing, horribly lack lustre visuals, and watching the entire cast (including Asuna) be sacrificed on the altar of SuguhaxKirito makes this a venture in masochism more than anything else, because watching it is nothing short of painful. quickly swept aside as the recap of the series begins with a vengeance, with an hour and a half of revisiting the important moments of the show, with the characters (mostly the girls) commentating on the action.

There isn't really a story to the OVA except of wrapping things up with normal life after SAO and ALO.  So 3/4 is recap with the characters doing casual stuff with a few funny and lighthearted scenes in between, and the other fourth is where they actually do things.  The part with actual action is nothing serious but rather invokes a sense of adventure and just there to close things up for the OVA with happy...feels.  In all, this is just for reminiscing while seeing all your favorite characters interact with a nice segment at the end to appease those looking for action.  I enjoyed it a lot because I felt nostalgic, and happy just watching the character continue daily life in paradise with flashbacks, and witnessing the great Animation and Sound that were brought to us in the anime. feels.

Watched subbed.', 'Whenever someone says that the 2012 juggernaut, Sword Art Online is one of, if not, the worst anime in existence, it\'s really easy to want to point at more broken, insipid, and pointless pieces of shit that have come out before or since. Personally, Hand Shakers, Arifureta, Darling in the FranXX, and Irregular at Magic High School are some of the first things that come to mind. However, those people are likely only talking about season 1, as unless they\'re completionists, they tend to not even care about watching anything else in the franchise in fear of wasting even more time. People don\'t tend to...watch the continuation of a show they consider among the worst of all time. That makes our job so much easier as we can introduce them to this ill-conceived recap film that sucks by even those standards, and tell people that things can always get worse. It’s not much worse, mind you, but still.What\'s worse than Sword Art Online: Extra Edition being tedious by even recap standards is the fact that the writers decided to justify its existence by taping an Alphein filler adventure to the back end of this monstrosity and cutting between recap footage and the girls from the main series getting to know each other over a pool party. If you thought the main series was boring, then this is like listening to an hour-long lecture for a class you couldn’t give half a billionth of a fuck about. The whole damn thing is so drawn out, and the added content brings a new dilemma you don\'t get with most recaps. If you want to marathon or otherwise consume all of the main SAO anime canon for some godforsaken reason like I did, you\'re gonna need to subtract 2 hours from your life with this bad boy to see like 30 minutes worth of mew material. If not for that, this would probably be an hour-long special no one but hardcore SAO fans and completionists watched instead of being something most people backtrack to when they remember this thing exists and is considered a sequel to SAO 1 and the prequel to SAO II.There are strange decisions made all over the place. For example, they cut from one scene in episode 4 to a minute later in the exact same scene and conversation.Sure, it’s best to try to save some time and only really keep the bare essentials if they’re going to try this at all, but this is a head-scratching edit. On the opposite side of the spectrum, earlier in the recap, they keep the entire ending of episode 1 instead of cutting it when Kirito runs away after Klein left for the first time, which is strange since the recap is wasting time that could be spent recapping things faster and more neatly. The constant cutting between SAO 1 content and the new scenes also results in some heavy tonal whiplash with absolutely no time to brace yourself or be eased in by a scene as it starts changing tones.It doesn’t help that the events of SAO proper are, to put it lightly, really fucking dumb. However, it’s nonetheless jarring when we cut from, say, Kirito mourning the death of someone he really cared about, to Suguha’s feet splashing about as Asuna towes her across a pool.Part of the problem is due to how the first arc was not really written in chronological order despite the anime adaptation assembling it that way, so the recap inherently feels more jumbled and like a lot of what’s in it means absolutely nothing. However, this recapm doesn’t even go through that order as almost everything in the first arc barring the beginning and end get shuffled depending on who’s telling the story or which part of a conversation introduces an event from the series. Inevitably, a recap won’t contain the pathos or a lot of the spectacle of what it’s summarizing, which is why recaps often feel like an absolute waste of time only meant to give production teams another week to finish the next episode of a TV show. This being a 101-minute special makes the bulk of it being a recap feel even more pointless, regardless of them attempting a framing device of Kirito being effectively coerced into an interview to tell the bulk of the story, or the other framing device of the girls telling Suguha how they met Kirito during the SAO 1 side-story episodes.It’s not even worth delving into contradictions in the new scenes, like how Kirito says you can’t beat floor bosses on your own when he pretty much did just that at least once or how the first boss wiped out half a raid when we only see one man in the entire group die. Before anyone tries to argue that the clip doesn’t do it justice and that the show must have shown others die, there was only one casualty in the fight during the SAO proper. Suguha’s swimming lessons get resolved in an afternoon and are basically just the backdrop to the girls talking about how they met the legendary Kazuto of the Kirito is Always Right Foundation It means nothing in the last 20 minutes, anyway. The Alphein quest that makes up the last 20 minutes is an excuse to get the gang back together to do a thing while hijinks happen and we learn a little bit more about Suguha. She then gets sidelined because, remember, Kirito’s the main character, not Suguha. What, are you stupid?These excursions are mildly cute at best but are otherwise drier than a desert. It honestly feels like they didn’t want to make 2 episode-length OVAs so these 20-ish minute pool and Alphein mini-stories get this shitty, awkward recap attached to turn this thing into a feature-length “movie” that’s treated like a special. There’s no other reason I can see for this when either way, this is a blatant attempt to tie fans over while they wait for SAO II to come out.SAO was never good with its characters, and this is no different. Barring Kirito really not wanting to be interviewed by and being agitated by a guy in a suit who will be a mainstay in the series, Everyone’s about the same as always. Kirito’s a boring lead, Asuna is a lame tsundere in a relationship with Kirito, SIlica\'s a flat-chested bubbly girl who loves Kirito, etc. etc. Actually, Asuna drops the tsundere act altogether and becomes a milquetoast nice girl that’s somehow even more dull than before. Now that Suguha’s done with her arc from Alphein, she’s left to be a boring girl who hasn’t gotten over Kirito. Don’t worry, this won’t be relevant or be its own arc for her, moving forward. The special also damages the one character I actually liked, that being Lisbeth, or “Rika” as she’s known IRL. Sure, she retains some of her smug snark factor, but having her only be there to tease people and then squeeze Suguha’s tits and contrast hers with the nonexistent cups Silica --or Keiko because real life-- has, like the perv this recap reveals her to be, is eye-rolling. The finale of SAO 1 already reversed her only character arc, so I guess it’s no surprise that he one female character who didn’t just feel like a trope or a mess of awkwardly-handled drama ideas gets turned into the pervert with tits trope LNs are somewhat fond of. Klein’s been relegated to a similar role, that being another pervy comic relief character like he sometimes was in the show itself, At least that makes more sense, even if it’s similarly annoying. Oh, and all of the character arcs outside of Suguha\'s are cut out, too, which makes sense for a recap, I suppose, but nonetheless adds to how pointless this damn special was. Poor Agil wasn’t even mentioned in the recap before being thrust into the last 20 minutes…The last thing to touch on is the audiovisuals. There are a couple of decent new tracks snuck into the recap as well as in the new scenes proper. The ED, ""Niji no Oto"" by Eir Aoi, is a solid song despite not being as good as OP 2, which is turned into an extended insert song for this special. Some tracks somehow still feel reused despite the recap sometimes taking liberties with the show’s music, but I need to at least try to list some positives, don’t I? Meanwhile, the visuals are as decidedly mediocre as in the TV show. There are a couple of decent action cuts, but the action is still somewhat stilted and the drawing quality is somewhat inconsistent. The environments are also less interesting than in many portions of the show. Perhaps this isn’t considered a movie because this would be pitiful by animated film standards when it’s already on the level of a middling, inconsistent, television production.I guess the one advantage this film/special has outside of the fact that it doesn\'t have a new sexual assault scene is that it\'s about ⅙ the length of your average SAO season at almost 2 hours. However, it doesn\'t really matter when it\'s almost 6 times less entertaining than a frustrating mess of a series that\'s only good when you\'re looking for a gateway title and don\'t know any of the technical aspects behind animation, directing, or storytelling because you’re 14 years old! When the highlight of your special is the first OP of season 1, you might as well scrap the whole damn thing. At best, Sword Art Online: Extra Edition is background movie fodder. Still, there are way better options in terms of films you leave on as white noise. It would have seriously been better as a 2-episode filler OVA tackling side-stories. It would’ve been droll, regardless, but that’s still better than being shackled to a broken recap of a terrible series. Anyone could have told you that, though. The idea of SAO being bad has sadly been treated as somewhat of an axiom by the community at large, after all. watch the continuation of a show they consider among the worst of all time. That makes our job so much easier as we can introduce them to this ill-conceived recap film that sucks by even those standards, and tell people that things can always get worse.

Kirito’s a boring lead, Asuna is a lame tsundere in a relationship with Kirito, SIlica\'s a flat-chested bubbly girl who loves Kirito, etc. etc. Actually, Asuna drops the tsundere act altogether and becomes a milquetoast nice girl that’s somehow even more dull than before. Now that Suguha’s done with her arc from Alphein, she’s left to be a boring girl who hasn’t gotten over Kirito. Don’t worry, this won’t be relevant or be its own arc for her, moving forward. The special also damages the one character I actually liked, that being Lisbeth, or “Rika” as she’s known IRL. Sure, she retains some of her smug snark factor, but having her only be there to tease people and then squeeze Suguha’s tits and contrast hers with the nonexistent cups Silica --or Keiko because real life-- has, like the perv this recap reveals her to be, is eye-rolling. The finale of SAO 1 already reversed her only character arc, so I guess it’s no surprise that he one female character who didn’t just feel like a trope or a mess of awkwardly-handled drama ideas gets turned into the pervert with tits trope LNs are somewhat fond of. Klein’s been relegated to a similar role, that being another pervy comic relief character like he sometimes was in the show itself, At least that makes more sense, even if it’s similarly annoying. Oh, and all of the character arcs outside of Suguha\'s are cut out, too, which makes sense for a recap, I suppose, but nonetheless adds to how pointless this damn special was. Poor Agil wasn’t even mentioned in the recap before being thrust into the last 20 minutes…The last thing to touch on is the audiovisuals. There are a couple of decent new tracks snuck into the recap as well as in the new scenes proper. The ED, ""Niji no Oto"" by Eir Aoi, is a solid song despite not being as good as OP 2, which is turned into an extended insert song for this special. Some tracks somehow still feel reused despite the recap sometimes taking liberties with the show’s music, but I need to at least try to list some positives, don’t I? Meanwhile, the visuals are as decidedly mediocre as in the TV show. There are a couple of decent action cuts, but the action is still somewhat stilted and the drawing quality is somewhat inconsistent. The environments are also less interesting than in many portions of the show. Perhaps this isn’t considered a movie because this would be pitiful by animated film standards when it’s already on the level of a middling, inconsistent, television production.I guess the one advantage this film/special has outside of the fact that it doesn\'t have a new sexual assault scene is that it\'s about ⅙ the length of your average SAO season at almost 2 hours. However, it doesn\'t really matter when it\'s almost 6 times less entertaining than a frustrating mess of a series that\'s only good when you\'re looking for a gateway title and don\'t know any of the technical aspects behind animation, directing, or storytelling because you’re 14 years old! When the highlight of your special is the first OP of season 1, you might as well scrap the whole damn thing. At best, Sword Art Online: Extra Edition is background movie fodder. Still, there are way better options in terms of films you leave on as white noise. It would have seriously been better as a 2-episode filler OVA tackling side-stories. It would’ve been droll, regardless, but that’s still better than being shackled to a broken recap of a terrible series. Anyone could have told you that, though. The idea of SAO being bad has sadly been treated as somewhat of an axiom by the community at large, after all.', ""To watch or not to watch that is the question.If you've seen the first season, then this is what your probably thinking: Is there anythin new?To answer your question, I'd have to say both yes and no.Here goes...Story 7/10Lets get the facts straight, this is a recap episode of the 1st season including SAO and Alfeim Online. That being said they have managed to do what most other anime couldn't by adding a bit of new content into the mix.The story is set post season 1 where Kirito, Asuna and their friends are going to their school for SAO survivors. The pretext for the...recap is an investigator asking Kirito about what went on in SAO and Alfeim Online. Sounds boring right, well they also added a new underwater quest in Alfeim Online that Kirito and the whole gang decide to go on.

Secondly, this movie was pretty good recap of some of the important events from season 1, but it's still a lot of flashbacks.  I definitely like how they explained why Kirito chose to be called a beater; when I first watched the series, I didn't understand why he took the title.The new ALheim quest wasn't bad, but more could've been added...to it; at least they didn't have the characters participate in an unrealistic fight against the kraken.  I love the sound and art, but it was basically the same as season 1 so I'll give it an 8.  I like how they dove a little bit more into Sughua's personality and had everyone explain to each other how they met Kirito.  Unfortunately, Sughua is my least favorite girl from the series so since my least favorite is the only one that got developed more, I personally, can't give the character part more than a 7.  I did enjoy this though, but two times is enough; I likely will not always rewatch this every-time  I start a rewatch of the whole series.  Overall, a 7/10 is fair; some people are too harsh simply because it's mainly flashbacks, but it was purely meant to just give slightly more backstory so a 7 is comfortable to me. to it; at least they didn't have the characters participate in an unrealistic fight against the kraken.

The Extra Edition did little to progress the anime and improve my feelings for it.Story: 5Most of the story was a recap for the first season (80% recap, 20% quest), which is the main reason behind the low score. The Extra Edition mainly focused on explaining the motives and feelings of the characters during SAO while including fan service where it can.However, the story itself does not have any noticeable flaws. Though a New Year-themed setting...would be more appropriate for an episode released before the New Year, it's good they adhered to the original timeline. The OVA also introduces a crucial character and has a unique whale idea. Despite the lack of progression due to recaps, because of these reasons I scored the story a 5.Art/Animation: 7Not much has changed due to the use of old scenes, which arguably take up the bulk of the OVA. Since I deemed the anime's art/animation good, I decided to stick to that. The monster battles and scenery were somewhat nice to look at. Not much to say here: it's good.Sound: 7Most of the music was borrowed from the original SAO, which was good in itself. I believe they added a few new pieces toward the end, which were also pleasing to hear. I question the use of the first OP but that's about it.Character: 4The story mainly focused on character reminiscing on what happened in SAO, letting us learn more about them. At the same time, they change little at all, and their likeability depends on your opinion of the stereotypical overpowered main lead, aggressive sandwich-making heroine, and little sisters. Though a new character is introduced, nearly nothing about him is revealed. The comedy from Klein is welcome though.Enjoyment: 3Unfortunately, the recaps left me bored for most of the OVA. A few enjoyable moments came every couple of minutes or so through the characters eating or swimming, which were easy to enjoy and relate to. I had to force myself to watch (or skip) through to the last 20 minutes, which were fun to say the least. Though it ended on a good note, a bulk of the OVA was unsatisfactory to me.Overall: 5It was okay to say at best.

There were some laughter that they provides in conversations and scenes in which we can relate to how we do in our daily lives. This results in a better storyline than what I have expected. Due to this, I give a 7, a slightly better score than what I give for the same type of movie.Next, the art is done exceptionally well. I am even surprise on the fanservice there is, there was a lot of effort put in. The fighting scenes are slightly improved and the extra scenes are also a lot better.For the sound, I was surprised that they bother to reuse the OPs and the ED2 of the main series as part of this movie. They were use in very good timing where it should be so I'm pretty much enjoy what's going although it happened before except the music this time is used at different parts of the movie.I don't really like giving reviews longer than this so I'll stop here.

Which will be awesome too!!!But going for what is important, story was FAIR, you already saw most of it before plus you get some new scenes, the art is very good, again not as good as the original since most is off the anime, same for the sound which I already loved off the first season! Character wise, not much development obviously, you get to see some new stuff about the characters, and itself you dont regret it at all, it makes what it needs to, be decent.For my personal experience, the movie, and being sincere, it isnt a worth go to a cinema to watch it, it is more like a summary of one of your favorite shows with some new scenes that airs on the TV and you had a good time with it, because you already enjoyed the show from before and knew the cast and previous stories, so it gave me a good time, and overall I reccomend it to every fan of the series, that pretends to go watching the second season, GGO arc and more...And if like me you couldnt wait to dig in on the next season, I reccomend you to give it a try to SAO Light novel since Vol 5, and probably to Vol 8, which IMO is the best way to fully experience this tech universe of the future.

I'll go over them starting at the final battle between Heathcliff and Kirito within the dungeon and how Asuna...was able to move after literally everyone else other than Kirito had been paralyzed, and why is it that after her sacrifice Kirito is able to miraculously come back to life for the time necessary to catch Heathcliff off guard and deliver the finishing blow? I’ll also be explaining how Kirito turns into a giant monster in the chasm on their way to the world tree, as well as how he defeats Sugou in ALO even though he was a game master.The answer my friends.....is Yui. After Yui had been targeted by the Cardinal system, Kirito accessed the active GM console using Yui's admin credentials and converted her data into an object in the game, note this happens BEFORE her admin credentials are revoked meaning that this object is still technically an administrator and being held by players of the game causes data corruption within the players themselves. The only people to hold the item containing Yui's data are Kirito and Asuna and because their data has been affected by a fragmented administrative power it could override a player debuff such as paralysis. Right after Yui has been converted to the object and corrupted their personal data, they’re sent to the front lines to fight the next dungeon boss so even if the system had been scanning every possible player for corruption routinely there wouldn’t have been enough time to catch and correct the issue, however, the most crucial part of all this is that Yui's data is being saved to Kirito's nerve gear’s local hard drive, meaning he is more heavily corrupted than Asuna being that she only made contact with Yui's heart through inventory shared storage. The reason he didn’t die (and no he never scattered apart, that “You Are Dead” sign and his character breaking apart were what he was thinking about; being that he had died during the beta test he knew what it would say and imagined himself breaking apart) was right after he scatters there are golden lights that appear to form his body back together within his realization that he’s dead; if you were paying close attention, those lights have the same animation that Yui’s body gave off after she was targeted by the Cardinal system. The next scene comes back to what’s actually happening as Kirito’s hands go from solid to ghostly since the system has a harder time rendering his death effect with Yui’s corrupted data which had her AI program with administrative credentials saved on his local hard drive.We can confirm this corruption in the episodes that follow where Kirito logs into ALO for the first time using an entirely new avatar that wasn't converted from his SAO account, however because he used the same name, his local nerve gear storage containing Yui's data had corrupted the new avatar even further and combined the stats of his new account with his SAO account while having intermittent admin credentials. Yui’s data was reconstructed in ALO to be used as a navigation NPC, however because she’s registered as a SAO administrator she still had access to the character logs which allow Kirito to access Heathcliff’s character and apply them to his own, which is confirmed when Kirito is facing off against Sugou after he's about to give up against all the odds, he's confronted by Kayaba in cyberspace who projects himself before him and grants Kirito access to the high game master character Heathcliff, Kirito then uses Yui’s administrative credentials to apply Heathcliff’s high game master status to himself with his character logs that Yui pulls from the SAO database and is able to demote Sugou because Kayaba is obviously the high game master of his own system as ALO was created using the Seed engine. If you’re not familiar with what a high game master is; most games that have game masters will have one specific game master above them, either in the form of the server owner or someone designated to correct the other game masters should one cause trouble in the game’s future.I said I would mention why he turned into a giant monster didn’t I? Well I don’t want a bunch of whiners so I’ll put that down here at the bottom since there’s a bit more to explain about the world of ALO and how it’s run in comparison to SAO. While SAO was stat, proficiency, and level based, ALO didn’t have any form of character leveling system, instead characters could equip items to increase specific stats and increase skill points regarding types of proficiency. Kirito’s ALO avatar’s corruption had combined the base level stats from his SAO character and also the proficiency skills he had leveled up; while ALO had a new set of skills, the skills he had maxed out before such as listening or detection to name a few had also been reworked into the corruption of his new skills, meaning his magic proficiency was one of the converted skill proficiencies from SAO that was no longer in use but carried over the skill points that it used to be considered for into a new proficiency. The use of the spell was obviously very close to, if not already max level for it to be as effective as it was. We can also infer that a basic spell’s effectiveness is increased by the level of the player’s proficiency as everyone is surprised to see Kirito cast Smoke Cloud and the wide area it covers.There you have it, you're welcome. I think I’ll mention that I also enjoyed every single arc and there are no issues with the pacing if you understand what the series is trying to do. I still feel bad for the people that can't see why this series is as good as it is, but I don't care at the same time, it sucks to be them. I could actually list more great aspects to this series that people don’t seem to understand but why should I bother? I’ll go re-watch the series and actually enjoy it just to spite them. By the way, the English dub sucks and the introductions of every single girl in the show had a deeper meaning than their relationship; I would say try watching it again to realize what I mean but odds are you won’t get it…. 10/10 was able to move after literally everyone else other than Kirito had been paralyzed, and why is it that after her sacrifice Kirito is able to miraculously come back to life for the time necessary to catch Heathcliff off guard and deliver the finishing blow?

Because of that it isn\'t really showing anything new, so spoilers is going to be very unlikely (hopefully).Story 7/10:  As I have said before this is mainly a recap of what had happened in the first season of SAO.  It really focuses on the main bits of what had happened, however they do add a short separate story that does happen in the MMO world.  When they told the...recap, it was done well but they could of told a bit more, however it was still good.  The separate story bit was meh at best, and at the end they were obviously building up to what is now going to be SAO season 2.Art 8/10:  When it comes to any virtual world animes, or live action shows for that matter, it has to be a visual appealing to it.  However, they really don\'t show anything new till the end, but it still holds a unique design and it was still good to the old design.  Appeal factor is still there.Sound 9/10:  The sound is still a really nice factor.  When they play the epic music it still adds the extra tension to the scene taking places, and it really does add more to the art that SAO has.  Also the VOs does a good job, no one really felt over the top (expect during epic fights) and they place the right amount of emotion towards there scenes.Characters 6/10:  They don\'t really add anyone new, and the one they did add was more or less simply used as an excuses to tell the story of season one.  There is no ""new"" character development or presences from anyone here.  That being said the score would of been lower, but during the recap part they show how everyone became who or what they are before and after the lock-down event in season one, and I really did enjoying seeing on how they became who there are.  We don\'t see for everyone though, and there is one that is included but didn\'t show his growth, sad but there it is.Enjoyment 8/10:  I really do enjoy this anime, I loved with what they did with the first season (but I did have some problems with the second half of it), and it was great to see this world again.  Also it didn\'t feel rushed at all, wished they add more characters to it, but it is still real good.Overall 8/10:  If you are a fan of the series then I recommend that you watch it, if you haven\'t seen SAO, then you mostly likely will be confused by it but at the same time get a good grasp as to what it is. recap, it was done well but they could of told a bit more, however it was still good.

(I\'ve changed my mind since then, but that\'s against the point) Despite being so deep into this ""masterpiece"" of a series I once enjoyed, one thing never changed throughout the course of time- I hate this film. All of it.The animation is decent enough, but it simply meets SAO standards. Besides, this film was released in the modern age of anime, so good animation is to be expected. But I will say this much- the representation of a lot of the characters (mainly girl characters) were...absolutely disgusting, and I\'m a male. If you had not seen the series before this, you would assume that all of these characters were rapists or prostitutes. I mean that.Now, the story... uh... it\'s recap. Moving on.The characters were all so weird in this film. If it had not been for the original series, these characters would have come off as genuinely creepy pervs. They took whatever development any of them had prior and threw it out the f***ing window. Out. Kirito is a generic lead, who was empathetical in the previous series. However, this film makes him out to be this unlikable teen who\'s ""too edgy for you."" All of the girls in this series come off as sex objects, and they were completely one-note in this film. Again, had it not been for the series prior, they probably would\'ve come off as part-time prostitutes. There was nothing likable about them whatsoever. Klein is a creeper in this film, which is odd considering how great he was in the series. I think that they decided to take whatever was likable about the original series, sh*t on it, and flush it down the toilet. Nothing about the characters in any sense were likable to anyone.The music used in this series was decent enough, but I don\'t care. The core of this series is dead. It\'s broken, and it can\'t come back. How about we do the world a favor, and burn every goddamn copy of this film. The only reason why I won\'t give it a 1/10 is because the animation was decent enough, and the music wasn\'t half bad either. But the reason we came here in the first place is dead. We\'re done here.I hate this f***ing film. I want to die.Later. absolutely disgusting, and I\'m a male.

I've always have and always will love SAO. despite the enormous amount of fanservice in this show and a lot of other things thay were negative, i still and always will love SAO for what it is. But this 'Extra Edition' only got the hopes up for all the perverted little 13 year olds who like seeing big breasted women swimming around in a pool while getting a recap of the first season, but they don't care about the recap because the only thing they can think about is how hot Asuna looks in a bikini (note: not my personal thoughts, i...found the fanservice very revolting actually). All this Extra edition was made for was to have a kinky little recap title before the new season of SAO begins. And i hate recap episodes. especially when the only other thing other then the recap stuff is fanservice, Fanservice, FANSERVICE. and even if i did care about recaps, i would still say this was pathetic. found the fanservice very revolting actually).

And this special episode isn\'t even important to SAO as a whole, it\'s pointless and you will be wasting time by watching it, especially if you\'ve seen the series already! So why would you...read a review about a pointless special RECAP episode of the first season of SAO?! Why would I write a review in the first place!?Honestly to past the time. So! SAO: Extra Edition recaps the entirety of the first season/first 2 arcs of SAO. The in-universe reason for the recap is because of some agent guy asking Kirito his perspective of the events while he was trapped in SAO, and the way the conversation goes just shows you how boring it is to watch two people talking to each other can be, especially since it\'s information you should probably know. I see no reason why someone new to SAO would start with a recap, and I see no reason why someone would rewatch the recap over the series if they are a fan. I know recaps are just a thing anime does, usually it seems to be made to indicate ""we got a new season coming!"" and it may be nice for someone to just relive their experience watching a show they like in one burst instead of watching a long series over again if they don\'t have the time.However, this is more than just a recap, it also has brand new footage that is unrelated to the recap. The in-between footage consists of the SAO girls swimming in a pool... and it is titillating if you\'re a young teen and you want to see these specific cute girls, wearing swimsuits, getting literally wet, and if you ""NEED"" to see them in motion and talking as well. The sexual fanservice is weak for pretty much everyone else. SAO isn\'t an ecchi series (as much as some infamous scenes want to push that boundary), and the animation isn\'t all that impressive to get me ""into"" seeing these girls swimming, plus I can probably find porn online of these girls anyways, in much more sexual art, with the only issue being that it won\'t be animated (which some scenes aren\'t all that ""animated"" anyways) and they won\'t be speaking with their voice actors as I watch. I can imagine them with their voices instead though. Now, why go into so much detail about the fanservice? Because the actual special puts so much emphasis on it! The poster has the girls in swimsuits! Of course I have to talk about it.So, if you\'re ever watching this special, and you really want to see the girls in the ""real world"" swimming in a pool, skip the recap stuff. If you want to see the girls in the ""virtual world"" swimming, then you\'re in luck because there is 20 minutes left, and part of that 20 minutes are exactly what I described. Just add Kirito\'s and Asuna\'s daughter into the mix, who is the size of a pixie and looks like a young child. Don\'t mind the police sirens outside your home if you chose to watch this special.Now to get into some specific aspects about this special rather than what you are shown. The animation is of the same quality as the series, so it\'s typical A1 Pictures quality. If they\'re a scene where characters are sitting and talking, it\'s lifeless, dry, and terrible. If there\'s an action scene, it\'s quick, and I mean that literally, as in the animation looks more ""quick"" than ""well done"". The art overall is basically what many see as the ""standard anime look"" of modern time, and the environments look fine to bland, even the beach and pool scenes. The voice acting is fine overall, no performance I would say is phenomenal, mostly because the material given isn\'t something I would say is Oscar worthy, but everyone sounds like what they\'re supposed to sound. Technically, there is nothing one can say is ""bad"" but also nothing one can say is ""above average"". It looks average.This special also has a little side-story, a ""gaiden"" if you will, about the cast of SAO just doing a side-quest. I have an issue with this, because I would have rather wanted this to be special episode. I would have rather watched a bunch of dorks play a side-quest with decent enough animation and art direction over bland sexual fan service that does nothing for me. And if you don\'t care for the characters, then the rest of the special is still pointless, and will probably get on your nerves depending how much you dislike the cast. If you like the characters, then you will enjoy your time watching these characters do something as pointless as a side-quest.If the special just front-loaded the recap, have less swimming scenes (maybe just leave some for the AFO portion), and a bigger chunk dedicated to a little tale of Kirito and his pals just adventuring, that would have been better and not been a waste of time.

Very briefly of course!Judging by the cover,Teekyuu seems like a typical ""slice of life"" anime about a girl\'s tennis team. The kind of anime that fans of the genre call, ""cute girls doing cute things"". However, it is actually a profoundly unfunny attempt to spoof those types of anime in the same way that Kill la Kill spoofs fighting shonen series and Panty and Stocking spoofs intentionally offensive American gross out cartoons. This means that Teekyuu\'s method of spoofing is of course to take as many cliches from the target genre as...possible and cramming them into 2 minute chunks. If you would ever like to see what would happen if the director of Kill la Kill and Panty and Stocking decided to direct Lucky Star, then THIS is the series for you!The fact that Teekyuu\'s writing and style of spoofing so closely resembles the works of Imaishi Hiroyuki isn\'t a coincidence. The director of this series is named Shin Itagaki and he was a co-worker of Hiroyuki\'s at Studio Gainax and worked directly under him in the production of Panty and Stocking. Itagaki then left Studio Gainax at about the same time Hiroyuki left to found the studio Trigger. The difference between Teekyuu and Kill la Kill is that Hiroyuki has control of Trigger and was able to spend a considerable amount of his new studio\'s budget on things like decent animation, a decent soundtrack, editing, LOTS of marketing and hyping etc. Hiroyuki also had the huge advantage of name recognition and a cult following who were going to eat up his next series basically no matter what he did. On the other hand, Itagaki has no name recognition and lacks a faithful following. He is the Yotaphone up against Hiroyuki\'s Apple Iphone. Another problem is that Itagaki does NOT have any control over the budget of the studio he works for (MAPPA). Studio MAPPA spends virtually ALL of its budget on Hajime no Ippo: Rising, so this project was basically made on about 50,000$ budget. If Kill la Kill had severe budget constraints, it would be Teekyuu. Therefore a 4/10 quality anime quickly became 2/10 quality.You would think how unfathomably shitty this anime is would result in it being a failure right? WRONG! The great thing about having no budget, is that with a little luck and perhaps a tad of misleading advertisement, you can make a handsome surplus. Consider that while Big Rigs Over the Road Racing was objectively one of the worst PC games ever made, its tiny budget allowed it to make a shockingly large profit off poor fools who liked truck racing games and picked it up without really knowing anything about it. In the same way, people who love ""cute little girl"" anime picked up this abomination and it made an absolute mint compared to its almost non-existent budget.

(dated joke is dated)', '(This is a review for seasons 1, 2 and 3.)Short shows that are unaffiliated with a franchise usually do not have the best of reputations save for a few gems such as Tsumiki no Ie. The latest and not-so-well received horror short animated by DEEN – Pupa, may be suffering from special circumstances, but it exemplifies a wider problem encompassing the vast majority of shows following the format. The time constrictions set inevitable restrictions on storytelling, characterization, and atmosphere building. Most short shows, rather than adapting to these limitations, simply adhere to the timeframe by limiting their content. The works produced as such imminently end...up wretchedly banal, etiolated in nuance, and ultimately completely forgettable. Few shows manage to overcome this problem, much less turn it into an advantage. Teekyuu achieves the latter; it is a pinnacle among comedy shorts that wouldn’t come out as superbly in any other format.Teekyuu is essentially a short and crazy comedy show which follows four girls and their daily lives in the tennis club. Note that I use the terms “story”, “daily lives” and “tennis club” loosely as the story is practically a nonentity; their daily lives are not just ordinary daily lives; and the girls seem to, save for a few rare occasions, do anything but tennis. Note that by “anything”, I really mean a whole damn lot of things.  Each episode is two minutes long and almost all of them follow an episodic approach with no connections between them other than the basic premise. This episodic formula synergizes seamlessly with the short timeframe and works wonders for the series. If there is one phrase which desbribes Teekyuu, it would be “refreshingly bizarre”. Over time, novelty may wear off and quirkiness lose its impact, but Teekyuu keeps itself a fresh by consisting of short episodes which constantly introduce new and creative absurdities strongly redolent of Gintama and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. What is rather unique for Teekyuu, however, is its extremely fast and adrenaline-inducing pace: the events and dialogues are more overwhelming than the monologues of The Tatami Galaxy’s protagonist or the scientific gibberish uttered in NERV command center. The short length of each episode works to the show’s benefit in numerous ways: it continually provides room for new scenarios, offers a break from the show’s intensity, and prevents itself from feeling dragged out. As there is no overarching plotline, no time is wasted on weaving a coherent narrative and all efforts are poured into squeezing the maximum amount of creativity and absurdity into the little time that is available.Such unconventional and ineffable qualities as explained above are not suitably expressed through descriptions. An example would more accurately demonstrate the true nature of Teekyuu: take our tennis club members, put KFC’s Colonel Sanders in the team, pitch them in a baseball game against the baseball club in a competition over the possession of the tennis court, throw in some former major league players and an Apache helicopter, have one team’s capitulation be followed by the opposing team’s disqualification, make all of this happen in slightly over two minutes, and we have ourselves a standard episode of Teekyuu.Teekyuu’s main cast consists of four simple characters built from only three stereotypes: the crazily energetic and goofy type, the rich and seemingly demure type, and the straight man type. These archetypes are not developed upon, but are each severely distorted by the ludicrous style of the series. The characters are packed with so many quirks and are placed into such bizarre scenarios that despite all of them being stereotypical and undeveloped, their interactions and antics are crazily dynamic to say the least. After three seasons, I myself only know them as the crazy pink haired girl, the crazy blue haired girl, the rich brown haired girl and purple haired straight man girl. The characters are not particularly memorable individually, but are together as a group utterly unforgettable. Deep character development and edifying insight is not Teekyuu’s essence, and it wastes none of its already restricted time on what it wouldn’t benefit from.Standalone TV shorts are in general not particularly rewarding for the producers and consequently tend to suffer from poor production values. Produced by the rather obscure studio MAPPA, Teekyuu is no exception to this. It does do, however, a splendid job with what it has through sheer resourcefulness. Budget on the animation is dramatically cut back on in favour of making the art look lively and reasonably detailed with a vividly colourful palette. The results of this is its choppy and repetitive animation with an exceedingly goofy and bombastic appearance which in actuality enhances the raw and absurd atmosphere of the series. The background music and sound effects are, much like the animation, of poor quality while not hampering the viewers’ enjoyment of the show. The music is awfully generic and almost unnoticeable beyond its unconscious atmosphere building, but it is ultimately absolved as the constant chatter easily overshadows any music that may be playing. The exaggerated and cheesy sound effects used in the show may sound cheap, but they are executed flawlessly and become beneficial for its comedic feel. In addition to the background sounds, each episode is equipped with a 30-seconds opening song. Each season uses a different opening song and each of them manages to perfectly capture the essence of the show. They are simple, bizarre, ridiculous, and overly energetic, which really helps immerse the viewer in the right mood for the intense absurdity that is to follow.At the time of writing, Teekyuu has aired three seasons for a total of almost 40 episodes. Keeping a gag show fresh for so long is a feat in and of itself, but what is far more remarkable is how it keeps becoming better. The series is crazily bizarre from episode one; but looking back at season one has made me realize just how relatively tame it is compared to its sequels. Much like JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, Teekyuu constantly finds fresh ways to one-up itself. The series undergoes a gradual escalation from school club comedy to encountering extraterrestrial visitors or inter-dimensional travel into a game world where upon completion one returns to the original world with a physically fit body. Tact, subtlety, and physical laws become entirely disregarded in favour of pure fun and entertainment.Admittedly, I have a certain tendresse for this show and my bias shines right through this entire review. Comedy is impossible to review objectively to begin with, if such a thing as objectivity even exists. All I know for sure is that if you like bizarreness and don’t find enjoyment to be a non-factor in viewing anime, giving the show a try wouldn’t hurt. After all, plowing through this review takes longer time than actually watching an episode or two. Teekyuu will not be everyone’s cup of tea - it is absurd, immature, playful, and ultimately falls under the brainless entertainment category, albeit the extremely fun type of brainless entertainment.But are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here? up wretchedly banal, etiolated in nuance, and ultimately completely forgettable. Few shows manage to overcome this problem, much less turn it into an advantage. Teekyuu achieves the latter; it is a pinnacle among comedy shorts that wouldn’t come out as superbly in any other format.Teekyuu is essentially a short and crazy comedy show which follows four girls and their daily lives in the tennis club. Note that I use the terms “story”, “daily lives” and “tennis club” loosely as the story is practically a nonentity; their daily lives are not just ordinary daily lives; and the girls seem to, save for a few rare occasions, do anything but tennis. Note that by “anything”, I really mean a whole damn lot of things.  Each episode is two minutes long and almost all of them follow an episodic approach with no connections between them other than the basic premise. This episodic formula synergizes seamlessly with the short timeframe and works wonders for the series. If there is one phrase which desbribes Teekyuu, it would be “refreshingly bizarre”. Over time, novelty may wear off and quirkiness lose its impact, but Teekyuu keeps itself a fresh by consisting of short episodes which constantly introduce new and creative absurdities strongly redolent of Gintama and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. What is rather unique for Teekyuu, however, is its extremely fast and adrenaline-inducing pace: the events and dialogues are more overwhelming than the monologues of The Tatami Galaxy’s protagonist or the scientific gibberish uttered in NERV command center. The short length of each episode works to the show’s benefit in numerous ways: it continually provides room for new scenarios, offers a break from the show’s intensity, and prevents itself from feeling dragged out. As there is no overarching plotline, no time is wasted on weaving a coherent narrative and all efforts are poured into squeezing the maximum amount of creativity and absurdity into the little time that is available.Such unconventional and ineffable qualities as explained above are not suitably expressed through descriptions. An example would more accurately demonstrate the true nature of Teekyuu: take our tennis club members, put KFC’s Colonel Sanders in the team, pitch them in a baseball game against the baseball club in a competition over the possession of the tennis court, throw in some former major league players and an Apache helicopter, have one team’s capitulation be followed by the opposing team’s disqualification, make all of this happen in slightly over two minutes, and we have ourselves a standard episode of Teekyuu.Teekyuu’s main cast consists of four simple characters built from only three stereotypes: the crazily energetic and goofy type, the rich and seemingly demure type, and the straight man type. These archetypes are not developed upon, but are each severely distorted by the ludicrous style of the series. The characters are packed with so many quirks and are placed into such bizarre scenarios that despite all of them being stereotypical and undeveloped, their interactions and antics are crazily dynamic to say the least. After three seasons, I myself only know them as the crazy pink haired girl, the crazy blue haired girl, the rich brown haired girl and purple haired straight man girl. The characters are not particularly memorable individually, but are together as a group utterly unforgettable. Deep character development and edifying insight is not Teekyuu’s essence, and it wastes none of its already restricted time on what it wouldn’t benefit from.Standalone TV shorts are in general not particularly rewarding for the producers and consequently tend to suffer from poor production values. Produced by the rather obscure studio MAPPA, Teekyuu is no exception to this. It does do, however, a splendid job with what it has through sheer resourcefulness. Budget on the animation is dramatically cut back on in favour of making the art look lively and reasonably detailed with a vividly colourful palette. The results of this is its choppy and repetitive animation with an exceedingly goofy and bombastic appearance which in actuality enhances the raw and absurd atmosphere of the series. The background music and sound effects are, much like the animation, of poor quality while not hampering the viewers’ enjoyment of the show. The music is awfully generic and almost unnoticeable beyond its unconscious atmosphere building, but it is ultimately absolved as the constant chatter easily overshadows any music that may be playing. The exaggerated and cheesy sound effects used in the show may sound cheap, but they are executed flawlessly and become beneficial for its comedic feel. In addition to the background sounds, each episode is equipped with a 30-seconds opening song. Each season uses a different opening song and each of them manages to perfectly capture the essence of the show. They are simple, bizarre, ridiculous, and overly energetic, which really helps immerse the viewer in the right mood for the intense absurdity that is to follow.At the time of writing, Teekyuu has aired three seasons for a total of almost 40 episodes. Keeping a gag show fresh for so long is a feat in and of itself, but what is far more remarkable is how it keeps becoming better. The series is crazily bizarre from episode one; but looking back at season one has made me realize just how relatively tame it is compared to its sequels. Much like JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, Teekyuu constantly finds fresh ways to one-up itself. The series undergoes a gradual escalation from school club comedy to encountering extraterrestrial visitors or inter-dimensional travel into a game world where upon completion one returns to the original world with a physically fit body. Tact, subtlety, and physical laws become entirely disregarded in favour of pure fun and entertainment.Admittedly, I have a certain tendresse for this show and my bias shines right through this entire review. Comedy is impossible to review objectively to begin with, if such a thing as objectivity even exists. All I know for sure is that if you like bizarreness and don’t find enjoyment to be a non-factor in viewing anime, giving the show a try wouldn’t hurt.

There are only four characters pretty much, and the entirety of the show focuses on whatever they're up to.The art is alright.

In just less than 30 minutes, I was able to grasp so much comedy and cherish the lovable characters. Teekyu is a comedy anime about nothing really. Its plot should not be taken seriously, the focus of the anime is the extremely fast paced comedy. When I say fast paced, I mean that the plot for each episode goes by so fast, you may not be able to process what’s going on.Yet, that’s the genius of this anime. The two-minute length of each episode is just right...for a comedy this fast. Each episode consists of the characters doing things together in a haphazard manner. This can range from quick plot twists to random stuff happening that has nothing to do with the episode to making fun of tropes. This is NOT bad, as the way it is utilized in its fast paced comedy is absolutely hilarious. Seeing these things utilized in such an unusually rapid pace is the appeal. The purposefully done bad animation/music and expressive characters also further benefit the comedy.The scary part is that for each season the comedy gets better, getting more random and chaotic than the last. Not every joke is going to hit home for everyone though, but that is ok as the anime will move on to the next joke very quickly to get you laughing/smiling. The anime really knows what it wants to be and I can immediately tell just by watching, the voice actors had a splendid time voicing these characters in a fast paced manner.The best way to watch Teekyu is to fully embrace the fast paced comedy. I personally recommend that you digest at most 3 episodes per day so that you are not overwhelmed by the fast plot progression. Think of Teekyu as the anime-equivalent of coffee, you wake up in a bad mood. What do you do next to cure that mood fast? Watch one episode of Teekyu to get you waking up laughing and starting the day right. Just remind yourself to not be hyper after you finish an episode.Overdosing on Teekyu will make you get worn out of the comedy extremely fast. It is kind of like watching Nichijou, where it’s best served when you watch a few episodes at a time to not be overwhelmed by its over-the-top slapstick humor. Teekyu is meant to be watched every so often. But if you do want to watch an entire season or even the entire series to catch up where it is now, you can do that in less than a day. Just remember to take breaks when you feel overwhelmed.I personally consider Teekyu to be one of comedy anime’s greatest. It’s not the best comedy per say, but the fast and energetic nature makes it one of a kind and worth the watch. Do not worry about the amount of seasons Teekyu has as each episode is about two minutes long. I guarantee you will have a great time if you embrace the anime for what it is. for a comedy this fast.

The two-minute-episode format trembles in fear at the sound of the name “Teekyuu,” for few other shows dare to cram as much action into those two minutes as this.Rating Teekyuu along the preordained metrics poses some difficulty, as this show, given its run time, has no space to spare for things like character and story and no budget for things like animation.  Three radically insane misfits and one regular misfit join together to form a high school tennis club and do anything but play tennis, because, by the...show’s own admission, animating a tennis match would require far too much effort.  Fortunately, more than it is any kind of actual slice-of-life or, heaven forbid, sports-related show, Teekyuu is a platform for the delivery of blisteringly fast punchlines, many of which are purely surreal.

An overwhelming yet delightful serve of humor.Teekyuu spins a refreshingly zany twist on the sports genre. Its rapid-fire humor is complemented by an art style as vibrant and fast-paced as its narrative. The characters, while not profoundly deep, are quirky and memorable, each embracing their own blend of strengths and comedic flaws. Their reactions, while far from realistic, are consistently in line with the anime's over-the-top essence. While its whirlwind nature might be disorienting for some, fans of non-stop comedy will undoubtedly revel in its chaotic charm. "", ""When I first started watching Teekyuu, I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Really, the comedy is hit-or-miss and might not be for everyone, but if you're looking for a quick laugh and can't bother with 20 minute episodes, then Teekyuu might be for you. The characters are all ridiculously funny and lighthearted, the opening was extremely catchy, and you sometimes forget that this show is supposed to be about tennis.I thought the seiyuu did a great job throughout, making the comedy stand out despite the absolutely random story. Overall, I enjoyed every moment of Teekyuu, and while it's not...a masterpiece, it shows that caffeine and a sense of humor can go quite well with each other. a masterpiece, it shows that caffeine and a sense of humor can go quite well with each other."", ""This is kind of an odd anime, I guess I should start at the first thing I noticed about this show is that it goes by real fast. Not only do the episodes only last 2 minutes but the characters talk quick as hell. This has to be one of the only anime where I had a hard time keeping up with the subtitles. This is also where I find fault with it as I feel some jokes might have been funny if they had enough time to be absorbed but I also never got to know the characters names properly except for Yuri (I...had to go back and look up the others' names).From they're actions I could say I liked the Kanae (Pink haired girl) and Marimo (Lighter Blue hair girl) as they're antics find the shows speed well but that doesn't make up for the fact I was always left not knowing what to think of what I just saw.  I will conclude with saying that this show just needs a slight slow down in it's speed maybe like 10% which would make each episode 2:20 minutes in length, something I feel would allow the viewer enough time to laugh at something before being bombarded by more jokes. had to go back and look up the others' names).From they're actions I could say I liked the Kanae (Pink haired girl) and Marimo (Lighter Blue hair girl) as they're antics find the shows speed well but that doesn't make up for the fact I was always left not knowing what to think of what I just saw.

I had expected that this series would fill in some of the plot holes from .Hack/Sign but they were only half fulfilled. As someone who has not played the game I have no idea why Kite and Blackrose are famous ... However, Twilight is a tolerable standalone.CharactersIn contrast to .Hack/Sign, the plot moves along at a much swifter pace while the characters develop quickly. There are Shugo and Rena, twin brother/sister who win characters based on Kite and Blackrose. As they're around 14 in real life they act like teenagers. Twilight isn't...full of too much philosophical talking since both protagonists are young. This could be a good or bad thing depending on each viewer.Shugo is brash and caring.

The major differences that seperate these two sereis are the seriousness factor and the character design (full design, not just art). You'll notice a much heavier influence of comedy in this series as well as a bit of more childish behavior from the characters (mainly due to the characters not being very old themselves).The story mainly takes place in a place called The World, a virtual reality based for a video game controlled by players using a keyboard and a...virtual reality headset. The two main characters are brother and sister in real life, but who now live apart from each other and it focuses on their introduction to The World, the people they meet, and the major dilema they run into that threatens the game world.For anyone who watches this series, you'll notice major similarities between the original series (Sign) and this one; As well as an episode plot repeat, just update with the current environment(story/age/characters) (but still plays out just as nicely).The character design is done well enough, yet different enough (from each other and other series) that it keeps you attracted to them and somewhat wishing them the best.Overall, it's not a bad anime, just rather lacks the certain elements that made .hack//Sign such a ground-breaking story and anime.Key Notes:*This IS NOT as serious as .hack//Sign. It is more of a comedy than the previous series.*This DOES look/feel very similar to .hack//Sign*This IS much shorter than .hack//Sign*This IS still worth watching if you are into the series. virtual reality headset.

I mean sure it was interesting enough that they were in a video game and not many other animes have that concept but the fact that they are in a video game kind of gave me an idea that yes there should be action considering everything in their world is fiction so anything might be possible, and that includes ridiculous laws of physics and whatnot, sadly that didn\'t really happen. It has the typical good guy and bad guy scene going on, it\'s fair but at the same time it leaves so much more improvement for a better more complicated storyline, instead they just chose to go linear with it. It might have been aimed towards more for the kids since the characters themselves are children compared to the other .hack series but can\'t really do much there.Bottom line for the storyline, considering it\'s a video game I expected a more complicated and action packed story rathen than a very linear and predictable tale.ArtI didn\'t complain much about the Art, with the library of anime that I\'ve watched it\'s safe to say that art isn\'t such a big factor for me to like it, it\'s more for the storyline and character development. This anime was made in 2003 and it certainly looked like it with the art, nothing too fancy, a few 3D edits here and there but nothing that\'ll really blow your mind. The very different and bright colours they chose really gave that fictional look on them which is perfect for the kind of concept this anime held. Overall, there was nothing wrong with the art, fair.CharacterNow the characters are the ones that I have the problem with, being myself I don\'t really like children that much, and with this anime having the protagonists being children made me clench my teeth already, BUT that doesn\'t mean that this part of the review is focusing on negative personal things, it means that they are just not my kind of characters (being children).They have shown really good character growth from the start of the series to the end of the series, I guess that\'s what they called ""leveling up""? If they didn\'t show signs of growing then they must\'ve been playing the game wrong for sure haha. Overall, there was a good variety of characters, almost every kind of personality could relate to at least one of them and they showed tremendous growth (protagonist)OverallHonestly, this .hack series had the most action out of all the other ones and just for that I\'d like to make this series the best one out of all, you might tell me ""Oh, you haven\'t played the games that\'s why you think it\'s okay"", well it\'s true that my opinions might change about it if I decide to play the game, but I\'m giving you guys the perspective from a person that hasn\'t played the games and I\'m sure there are tons of other people out there that want to start watching this anime but decide to get a view from a person that hasn\'t played the video games.cheers. as good as I can.================================================StoryUnlike numerous animes that I\'ve watched the story for this series never really caught on to me, and what I mean by that is that it never really got me to want to watch the next episode after watching one.

Also .hack//Legend of the Twilight, was the first and only .hack series I have seen.Story (4/10):As a stand alone, much of the story didn't make much sense, and it wasn't the beginning that was so confusing. The beginning was rather interesting. Two siblings using a virtual game to stay in touch. It's what happens in the game that makes it so difficult to understand the plot. Throughout the entire anime, they hint at previous disasters and important events that have since past. For an avid .hack fan, it probably wouldn't have been a problem....As a first time viewer, so many aspects of the game weren't properly explained, so it was nearly impossible for me to connect to the plot and root for the survival of the characters.Art (7/10):The art by itself wasn't too shabby. The colors were bright, the characters were cute. Typical online games have pretty looking avatars. Overall though, it didn't quite match the story. When offline, I found it annoying how they would never show the eyes of the real people.Sound (8/10):I actually quite liked the sound. The opening was very catchy, if not a little too upbeat, and most of the music in game is what you would expect from an MMORPG. The ending, however, just sounds so soft and sad, and I can't make up my mind as to if that's a good thing or a bad thing.Characters (6/10):The characters weren't cliche or stereotypical, but I didn't fall in love with any of them. Shugo just wasn't all that likable although he had plenty of good qualities. Rena was fun character to watch, while Mireille was extremely annoying. Enough so that one character almost made me drop this series. The AIs were mostly underdeveloped and confusing. For people who've only seen this series, like me, we fail to see how the AIs are developed and just how/why they are so important to the game.Enjoyment (4/10):It was a pretty confusing and un-enjoyable show, although it did have some funny and cool sequences. I, however, think they should have either made this into more of a sequel or more of a stand alone, because as it stands, it doesn't seem to satisfy anyone.Overall (6/10):It was not the worst anime I've ever seen, but with a confusing story, unique, but not altogether likable characters, and art that doesn't match the tone of the story, this is a fair anime at best. For avid .hack fans though, they might enjoy another excursion into the world of .hack. For people who've never seen a .hack series before, I definitely wouldn't recommend this show.

A lot of this just seems like it’s made for the fan service and objects.The Beginning song isn’t really anything special. In fact, I just pretty much figured I could just skip it since it was a bit annoying. In fact, almost every bit of music that is in this seems to be off.

It is a hybridized sequel to .hack//Sign, and to the .hack video games. Although there are brief mentions and easter eggs from these previous installments, this anime is still quite watchable without having previous knowledge.This show has a completely different feel than any of its predecessors. For those who have seen .hack//Sign, the major difference with this series is that it is a much livelier (at a faster pace of 12 episodes), playful look at “the World” and the things that go on inside it.

I say possibly cuz it was a long ass time ago and I don\'t really remember, and it was such a long time ago that the whole reason I got the first volume of the manga was because my horny pubescent mind noticed the steamy full color ""pin-up"" inserts in the first couple of pages. Good thing my mom wasn\'t curious enough about Japanese culture to ask to take a look before buying.However, this turned out to be the one time in my life my dick coerced...me into making a good decision - the manga was actually pretty enjoyable in its entirety, and I read the whole thing several times, completely taken in by that magic I spend all of my time as an anime watcher trying to capture more of. Now, some months later I see a familiar looking DVD sitting on the new releases shelf of a store. They made an anime adaptation of my favorite manga at the time, and I couldn\'t have been more excited to see the story and characters I liked in full color, motion, and sound. That wasn\'t really meant to be. You see, as it so happens the .hack//Legend of the Twilight was one of those short mediocre budget series more concerned with advertising the manga than it was with doing it justice. Evident by the fact that the studios couldn\'t wait a measly ten months for the manga to finish.This led to one of the most drastically changed anime adaptations I\'ve ever seen. I\'m not inherently opposed to this idea, since changes always bring the chance of some improvements (like parts of Fullmetal Alchemist), but the fact is that improvements are extremely unlikely and optimally shouldn\'t be prioritized over first doing a faithful adaption. In an ideal world we\'d have our complete manga adaptations and then whatever extended universe/re-imagining series the studios wanted, but in the real world there are time, budgets, and profits to consider.To make a long story short, if you\'re a .hack fan interested in the Legend of the Twilight world and were only going to do the anime or the manga, then do the manga because it\'s far, far better. Or at the very least do both, because they\'re entirely different stories. They begin seemingly the same way: Shugo and Rena are siblings living under different parents who reconnect in the online game ""The World"" after winning avatars that look like previous legendary The World players. When they\'re attacked by a mysteriously invincible monster, Shugo is killed and revived after being given a special bracelet item by a girl named Aura. This bracelet can rewrite data in the game to weaken it, allowing Shugo to combat these new invincible monsters. Shugo and Rena try to play the game normally but are continuously disrupted by strange circumstances and more invincible monsters. With the help of new friends Mireille, Ouka, Hotaru, as well as systems administrator Balmung and his friend Sanjuro, they\'ll have to confront whatever is threatening The World.The anime\'s story majorly deviates from the manga early on when Rena disappears for half the series after being killed by one of the special monsters. It\'s around here we see that our main antagonists are a group of hacker children, which is very lame because aside from our villains being snobby brats their motives are also never fully explained, they basically never interact with our main characters directly, and in the end they\'re written out of the story like they never existed. Every once in a while they send an invincible monster after Shugo because his Twilight Bracelet threatens their plans, but they never seem to realize Shugo can just deus ex machina it with Data Drain and win every battle the same way. It\'s similarly annoying to see the other characters attack the self-regenerating monsters repeatedly even though they know from experience only Shugo can do anything.If you remember Shugo and Rena\'s relationship in the manga being far too affectionate for a brother and sister, then you\'re really going to shake when the incest dial is turned up even further in the anime. Shugo is downright in love with his sister this time, ogling her (or at least her player avatar) twice in the first two episodes, and literally half of Rena\'s dialogue in the entire series is her yelling ""onii-chaaaan!"" often several times in a row. It\'s only made creepier when you remember this sibling love is bordering on both of them experiencing the beginning of puberty at around 14 years old or so. Gross.When the ""search for Rena"" plot appears one of the anime\'s worst traits is made obvious: it likes to waste as much time as it can. It does most of this through a ton of long-takes (this is where the ""camera"" pans slowly across a scene, sometimes to get something across but in here for nothing usually) and redundant pointless scenes of Shugo and friends running around looking for Rena all over The World, which is a completely stupid idea because if she was in a normal area she would obviously be contactable or could just log out. This new plot also means the manga\'s cute minor one of reuniting Zefie with her mother is completely gone. All other characters return in mostly similar roles, but a new main character called Sanjuro replaces Zefie. He\'s some experienced samurai type who mentors and trains Shugo even though his bracelet is more unstoppable than any legitimate attack, and he\'s friends with Balmung and also realizes the danger coming to The World.Nothing in the anime really has much personal stake to it. The main antagonist is only revealed when the anime is almost over and is never even hinted at or lead into before then, and neither they or the child hackers have absolutely anything to do with Shugo or Rena besides them just happening to win the special costumes (which they also had nothing to do with). Literally Shugo\'s only reason to be involved with any of this is because Rena just happens to get kidnapped. Naturally, the side characters Mireille, Ouka, and Hotaru, despite being far more likable than the two main characters have even less to do with anything that\'s happening and really don\'t help much at all when the story is all said and done.There\'s a terrible tendency for the show to introduce slapstick jokes at complete random and often totally inappropriate moments. The worst example is the series\'s running gag of having Shugo, who is seriously one of the dumbest, most helpless anime protagonists I\'ve ever seen, constantly trip and run into things and break a tooth off (which is even kept in some subsequent scenes which looks ridiculous). In the climax of the anime when everything is doomed bla bla bla a total comic relief character barges in from the edge of this apocalyptic scene just to cry and scream and run into a wall like an idiot. I know Legend of the Twilight is obviously aimed at a younger audience, both anime and manga, but that doesn\'t mean kids are complete idiots who can\'t get engrossed into any drama.If there is a single good thing about the anime\'s story changes, it\'s that the plot is now much more dependent on it taking place inside of a game. It wouldn\'t take much at all to rewrite the manga to fit inside a typical fantasy world with actual magic and such. The biggest problem would be Shugo\'s bracelet rewriting code to linearly make monsters weaker, but it still wouldn\'t be hard to imagine it as some kind of transformation spell. This is relevant because it\'s inherently harder to take a story seriously inside a world that has less consequences than a ""real"" one. In the anime the elements of hackers and such mean it has much more to do with .hack\'s unique setting, which is the whole point of .hack to begin with. Despite this, there\'s constant logic holes where the writers failed to equate the logic of the game world with what\'s going on in the story. In one scene a hacker has already been caught by the CC Corporation staff, but instead of them just banning him instantly because this is all data and they have the controls to do that, they literally chase the hacker around a virtual town until they catch them physically. Also, how are completely fluid human movements made with just a regular game controller? They could\'ve just said the headset has some mind-reading power for all I care since obviously the fictional technology is already highly advanced compared to ours. In one scene the administrators talk about monitoring log-in info to see who accessed servers, but when they\'re searching for Shugo and friends none of them think to just stand by and wait until Shugo logs in for the first time of the day before he reaches Mireille\'s hideout and just capture him there? Also, why is a hideout hidden from administrators. They\'re administrators, they should have access to everything. There are hundreds of things in the anime to nitpick like this, and it counts because it makes both the world incoherent and the ability to buy into it as a gamer difficult. Everything I wrote above could have been written around, but the writers were either lazy or not very clever.The series was made around the time when digital animation was starting to take over, and it shows the worst aspects of the format. The show is full of bright, solid colors that aren\'t shaded well at all and give it a very ""flash cartoon"" appearance, and there are frequent ""moeblob"" faces and other poor art flubs such as background characters having stick-thin or otherwise imbalanced limbs and screwed up faces. It\'s not an ugly anime, but it\'s not afraid to cut any corners. The backgrounds are painted though and look quite nice, with a lot of the fantasy architecture looking mystical with their odd color schemes yet friendly and inviting.The music is, oddly enough, easily the best part of the anime. It\'s not really something I\'d listen to outside of the show, but it\'s a somewhat post-modern mix of influences. It\'s typically light and breezy as the setting and characters are, and there\'s everything from synthesizers, xylophone-centered jazz, orchestration, and even (the best parts) picopop with bossa nova-esque vocals. I really like the opening even though the lyrics are completely impenetrable even by general anime standards, and the ending song and the short beautifully surreal visual sequence is literally my favorite part of the entire series. No joke.As for the dub vs. sub thing, it\'s a weird situation. Normally it\'s cut and dry whether a dub is worth checking out because either the studio cares or it doesn\'t, but in this case the casting is acceptable to great (both Steve Blum and Crispin Freeman as main characters) yet the voice you hear the most is absolutely horrendous. Bryce Papenbrook as Shugo is unbelievably aggravating, with constant shrill shrieks of whining and screaming for Rena like a complete teenage baby. It\'s absolutely maddening, and I don\'t know how someone thought this was an acceptable performance. It makes his moronic, childish personality even more grating. I guess try the dub and see if you can last ten seconds of Shugo\'s ballistic babbling because if you can tolerate it the rest is solid.But as a whole, I just don\'t want to recommend this to anyone. A serious .hack fan will watch it anyway and to them I only recommend to read the manga as well. Those on the fence should definitely just read the manga, where the main character personalities are far less annoying and every supporting character is used in the plot much more thoroughly. The story stays charming in its lack of severity which suits the more child-friendly tone of the art design and gentle characters, while the anime goes for broke on dramatic effect when it doesn\'t fit its surroundings and thus can\'t be taken very seriously. It also goes to mention its complete lack of depth, relevance to the series and its characters as a whole, and extremely vague explanations of events and character motivations, and almost every character is exactly the same at the end as they are at the beginning. It\'s a very uneven and loose story for something so short, while the manga stays within the modest confines the short length allows. Neither seem important to the overarching .hack story as a whole, so don\'t let thoughts of that sway your decisions. If Shugo went to my middle school I\'d bully him. me into making a good decision - the manga was actually pretty enjoyable in its entirety, and I read the whole thing several times, completely taken in by that magic I spend all of my time as an anime watcher trying to capture more of.

Though, it is not necessary to watch them in this order, the first three can be watched in any order but above is in chronological order.Compared to Sign and Liminality, this series is way better in my opinion. Unlike sign and liminality there is actually real action in this one! I swore...to myself if this series was like sign I was gonna quit this whole series. The creators wised up while making this one. They needed to put some action and cram less dialogue into the series.I don\'t specifically remember anytime that I was bored or wondered how much longer I had left in the series. This series was perfect and length and never seemed boring.

A major issue presented is the romantic subtext between twin siblings Shugo and Rena.

I like the storyline its just after awhile you can feel a sort of redundance setting in (interesting plot device to get story going, main characters and friend meet and fight monster, monster is strangely strong, characters manages to overcome monster) that's...just basic construct though the actual viewing of such is pleasant and occasionally a few episodes stray from that line of course most of those follow the storyline of (search for character, interesting event happens, fight monster, character overcomes monster, finds some clue or no clue to help him find character).Art- One of the better drawn and animated series in my opinion. I in particular like how the characters and monsters die like how they would in an old video game (i.e pixelating out). Although in all actuality a lot of my friends have commented on it being a little to chibi for their style.Sound- I loved the sound track for this series and in fact bought it I suggest doing the same...voice acting was really good too I mean voices matched the characters fairly well.Character- Time was spent on character development just not much time what I can suffice to tell you is that you know enough about the characters to get you through which really in the end is kind of how it's supposed to be.Enjoyment- Back in the day I enjoyed this series I mean it was unique, funny, and had action but compared to todays standards unless I label it as classic anime it really is in my opinion not to enjoyable.Overall- I suggest this series if you've watched any of the other various .hack series...trust me there are a lot and you kind of need to watch them all to understand the next one (okay not always true but still it gives you a basis for what you should expect). If you come for comedy you wont' be disapointed, if you come for action eh it'll vary, you come for drama yes you will have satisfaction, if you come for romance...expect incest. just basic construct though the actual viewing of such is pleasant and occasionally a few episodes stray from that line of course most of those follow the storyline of (search for character, interesting event happens, fight monster, character overcomes monster, finds some clue or no clue to help him find character).Art- One of the better drawn and animated series in my opinion.

It\'s about a lion salaryman and his co-workers (a perverted Toucan and a straight man lizard) and their mishaps and misadventures.The humor is reliant on real world problems and situations, such as Lion being mistaken for a pervert or trying to lose weight.Each episode is divided into 3 segments.The show IS funny but like I said, comedy is subjective and trying to explain it to you isn\'t easy.If you like realistic humor and comedy then give it a try but it\'s very Japanese centric humor and you might not grasp it.It isn\'t a masterpiece but it\'s a good comedy.

It\'s a cute and fun show with no real plot, but it\'s a good show to watch between series or during a break, or just whenever you need a good laugh. At first, the art style was a little off putting (constantly switching between 2d animation and CGI), but I think it really made the show something unique. It\'s almost fits in the ""so bad it\'s good"" category, with the characters and dialogue making up for the strange animation. The voice acting is all pretty good in my opinion, especially for what you expect when you see how...it looks. The casting seems to fit each character perfectly. Overall, it\'s a fun short series and definitely deserves a watch! it looks. The casting seems to fit each character perfectly.

I didn’t enjoy absolutely everything, and boy was Toucan annoying, but there were many hilarious moments and even some heartwarming ones. As a working adult I found it relatable, and a good way to just relax, switch off my brain and go with the flow.And Lion is absolutely adorable! I like the main VAs Tsuda Kenjiro, Ishida Akira (personal favourite) and even Shimono Hiro, and I totally heart Ohtsuka Akio in this. As well as him singing the ED, and...that the show was airing around his 60th birthday. Shassho-hamster cracked me up too. that the show was airing around his 60th birthday.

You really feel that from the first episode, and then it dives into more as the show goes on.Story and characters: 7This show really makes you think. Thinking is scary, the future is scary, as this could legit be our future, if we haven't completely destroyed ourselves by then. It might not be a future for you or I. But it could be a visioned future non the less. Where the idea of us living with androids is a real concept, among...other futuristic details, like how our towns and cities look, to how we move about, and the level of technology we have.But the story really dives into the idea of what it truly means to be human, and more so.Are we humans because we are born, and bred as such? Are androids human if they act, and seem like us to every detail? To even ave hopes and dreams? There is so much thought process to go into this, that it really is a head scratchier. Which is further reflected in it's characters. The choices they make, the path they are going on. You'll meet them episode through episode, and it'll further showcase that thought into your head, and will put that question into everyones heads. A really thoughtful anime.The only downside to it, is that it could come off as a little too serious, which results in it being a bit less interesting or vibrant? But that doesn't take away from the good plot idea that it has. It's a good show, filled with interesting and thought thinking themes.Art and sound: 7I won't lie. The art style in terms of it's faces at times, reminds me of Digimon, but if you added a more modern coat of paint to them. Like as if things are toned down, as if they have a more serious coat of paint on to it. Sure, it still has it's colours. But if gives off the vibe as if this show has a deeper meaning as it presents itself with. That is also reflected when it comes to how it sounds too.

Yes, but perhaps worryingly, not too far fetched.If you are looking for something thought provoking, this one is for you. Set in the near future, a series of vignettes present fascinating scenarios involving humans, humanoids (artificial humans), and AIs. The compact storytelling (often two vignettes in an episode) is remarkable but doesn’t leave time for complexity or deep emotional involvement. Each scenario is resolved without judgment, leaving the audience to ponder the issues, conflicts, and consequences. If you have wondered about our AI future, or maybe asked ChatGPT what’s in store for humanity, this show will give...you plenty to chew on. you plenty to chew on.', 'Ai no Idenshi is perhaps one of the most relevant anime to be released in recent memory. In an era of ever evolving technology and artificial intelligence, AI no Idenshi raises many complicated questions such as “how far is too far with technology” and “what does it mean to be human” Both are morally ambiguous and divisive, and what I like about this show is that it frames these topics in a neutral manner. It doesn’t shove an answer down your throat, but forces you to consider your positions on the matter. It’s a really interesting and thought provoking show that deserves much more love....If you’re a sci-fi fan or just curious about what the future of humanity could look like, this is one for you.Ai no Idenshi is set up in an episodic manner. It follows various individuals and their conflicts, usually related to some aspect of technology. That’s to say that most episodes are not related to some grand plot, but are designed to teach lessons. For example, wanting your memories or personality altered, removing emotions, robots attending schools with humans, teaching in human classrooms, learning human jobs, etc. There is an overarching plot involving the protagonist and his mother, but unfortunately, it only got focused on for like 3 episodes before the finale. Which is a shame, because it’s actually really interesting.For the vast majority of the series, we see characters in a variety of difficult situations that have morally gray solutions. What I like most about the episodic nature is that many of these cases feel real. They don’t feel so far-fetched that you just write it off as fantasy, instead they feel like inevitabilities given humanity’s rapid AI advancement. Sentient A.I, robots and androids walking alongside us, it’s not outside the realm of possibility that within our lifetimes we’ll see stuff like that. With those developments, though, comes new challenges that we will have to overcome. If these creations act like, look like and think like humans, what’s the difference? What will we do then? We haven’t seen many anime that tackle these themes, so I really had a lot of fun watching this. The near future setting as opposed to some distant future also made it a lot more enjoyable.The biggest gripe(s) I have with Ai no Idenshi are the animation, which is quite bad at times, frankly, and the fact the main story got neglected so much. I mean, I really did like the short stories. They’re meaningful and realistic, but there was a massive plotline teased at the beginning with the MC and his mom going missing, and then it doesn’t get touched on for like two months until the last 2 episodes or so. It was a really big missed opportunity in my opinion. I have not read the manga yet(I will), so I’m not sure if this is how things are there, but for the anime medium I think you need to start connecting those dots sooner. Maybe doing half episodic and half actual plot per episode? I’m not sure how you’d improve it, but it’s definitely the most glaring issue here.In terms of mainstays character wise there aren’t many besides Sudo and Risa, the rest of the cast is kind of a revolving door based on whatever situation we’re dealing with. They could be hit or miss, but the main cast was really good.Despite its issues, I still loved Ai no Idenshi and its best mini-arcs were up there with some of the best episodes of any seasonal this season. I loved Sudo as an MC, Risa was a nice supporting character and the character development she got later on was really solid. If you’re a Sci-Fi fan it goes without saying that you need to check this one out. It’s real, it’s relevant and it’s an eye opening watch. I know I had my ideas questioned several times throughout this one and I think you will too.Ai no Idenshi gets 8 out of 10.

Is it that authors have a burning desire to share with the world the possibilities of AI, or are unwilling to cash in on a niche product that\'ll not catch on?This season, there was one show that\'s more than enough to take on the premise of the world at large and its studies on AI, and that\'s mangaka Kyuuri Yamada\'s AI no Idenshi a.k.a The Gene of AI, a manga that lasted 87 chapters within 8 volumes, serialised between November 2015 and...August 2017. But the anime, which is only announced 5 years later and finally aired this Summer season, is just sad to say that any appeal that the manga had that was heavily exclusive to Japan, did not catch on in the West, not just for anyone trying to translate the already completed manga series, but its social traffic is not the best either, despite obtaining the Excellence Award in the manga division of the 21st Japan Media Arts Festival Awards in 2018.Similar to American medical profession drama shows like House, M.D. and Grey\'s Anatomy, AI no Idenshi focuses on a world where AI has taken over much of its processes, split into regular humans and android-like Humanoids, who need maintenance as and when it is necessary. And one place where the Humanoids go to receive their checkups is at this unassuming clinic called the Sudo Novo Medical Clinic, headed by its sole doctor, Hikaru ""Mogadeet"" Sudo and his AI assistant, Jay, alongside his assistant Risa Higuchi. For the most part, it\'s an episodic nature of discovering and discussing what makes Humanoids tick, ranging from personal areas like family and friends to scenarios of how they would react to love and romance. In essence, Humanoids aren\'t that different from humans, and the thought processes that arise from this do make for interesting plot narratives about the importance of AI driving the future of mankind, either into prosperity or destruction.That said, the one narrative that get you head-scratching is on the side of humans wanting to implement Humanoid-like features. And one example of it is the copy-exact nature of real humans into humanoids, so much so that they are indistinguishable from each other. This can especially be detrimental if reflected on a familial scale, and Sudo\'s life is not a purely blank state either, because he was once a victim of the measures that certain people will take as a way to gloss over that these practices ""will improve"" his life, only to suffer heavy consequences later on. Not all Humanoids are good, and neither will humans want to push the available technology, even if the scientific progressions are proven or not, just to prove that ""AI is the future, and we should all embrace its judgements upon humanity, regardless of whether they\'re correct or not.""If there is one thing you should know about this show, it is that the production is not its swan song, and neither is the direction that the anime took, that ultimately feels like the show is a chore to watch, being very sluggish. Partly because of storyboarder-cum-director Yuzo Sato, whose directorial duties include the most recent work of Winter 2022\'s Hakozume: Kouban Joshi no Gyakushuu a.k.a Police in a Pod, it feels like the production committee had a false start of wanting someone reputable to direct a show (you know, considering it\'s Madhouse), but that they could not find a suitable one, so Yuzo Sato had to be called in for the job, doing the bare minimum that he could. And looking at his biography, it seems as if Yuzo Sato had been the 3rd-rate director that was always given the ""last resort"" call, simply because he has not been doing much within the last 40 years of work in the anime industry, even from the time that he was brought into Madhouse since the early 2000s to be trained to become a competent director. But in the near 20 years since, I\'d reckon that Yuzo Sato lost his touch, and that unfortunately, speaks volumes about this show\'s adaptation, which could\'ve been better in almost every possible way.Also, this is a bit of a transition period for Madhouse, as they\'re trying to get back to their former grand slam state (which is set to return with Sousou no Frieren a.k.a Frieren: Beyond Journey\'s End next season) after the setback since the early 2020s, producing shows that for the most part, have been on a never-ending tick-tock cycle of good and bad in-between seasons. But if you are to only focus on this show, it feels like the production team never had any confidence in the anime, opting to animate the bare minimum while showcasing low quality visuals that while fits the dark and gloomy vibes of the anime, it wasn\'t the same Madhouse that we\'ve come to expect from.The music aspect is interesting at best. While Aile The Shota\'s OP song perfectly fits as the ""futuristic"" centerpiece for the anime, it\'s the visuals, of which some are created by Unreal Engine. It\'s definitely unique in that regard; I\'ll give it that. GReeeeN\'s ED song is a mellow song that has all the characteristics of a song that speaks volumes to all. Overall, cool songs that each have a distinction of their very own.The problem is, niche topics like AI and the future of mankind are accompanied by the far and few in-between, and despite AI no Idenshi being a standout show just for its themes, it really isn\'t enough to justify a show that\'s produced as it is this way. I appreciate that shows like this are brought out to break the usual Isekai, fantasy, romance molds that always finds its way into each and every season, but they need to double down on what makes them stand out, which sadly, this show doesn\'t do the original source material justice.Skip this show if it doesn\'t intrigue you, but it doesn\'t pay to at least watch a single episode of this, yeah...?

Short stories published in magazines that were as cheap as the paper they were printed on, and yet the questions and ideas they proposed became inspirations for nearly a century\'s worth of novels, films, games, and stories of all types. AI no Idenshi pleasantly surprised me when I found myself watching it and couldn\'t help but be reminded of the countless works of Pulp Sci Fi. It describes itself as an omnibus of short stories, and I certainly am finding it worth my time.To briefly explain what this show is...all about, Dr. Sudo Hikaru is a physician specializing in the treatment of humanoids and robots alike, while also moonlighting as an underground doctor for those who cannot seek legally treatment due to various circumstances. His cases are our window into the future imagined by the storywriters. The show, as a result, has a sort of sci-fi medical drama vibe, and our ""protagonist"" is actually very similar to us, often no more than an observer to the events unfolding around them. When needed, our doctor interjects with some advice or a treatment or piece of wisdom to force the characters and also the audience to reflect on what has just transpired.I understand that not everyone is likely going to enjoy this anime. I\'ve found many people criticizing it on the basis of the characters, or the brevity of time spent exploring a topic, or the lack of a plot, ect. But to me these complaints seem to be off the mark because its not the goal of AI no Idenshi to present a standard ""beginning middle end"" story, but to ask ""what if"" and try to show you a possible future in which our new technology is extrapolated in ways beyond our current imagination. So to me, these complaints would be like if I criticized a poem for lack of character development or a theatrical play for the lack of special effects. If you watch AI no Idenshi, you have to understand that the bread and butter of this show is not the characters or the plot, but the imagination of the future.If you consider so much of our modern Science Fiction has been inspired by a few pages of short stories by the likes of Asimov, Heinlein, and P.K. Dick (among others) back when it took a computer the size of a room to solve a few math problems, imagine the possible muses that can now be drawn by creative minds in the present day when we have AI-generated art, algorithms predicting what you want before you even are aware of it yourself, AI Deepfakes, and so on.AI no Idenshi certainly isnt a masterpiece of writing, but I\'ve been thoroughly invested in the futures it predicts and technologies it envisions. I\'ve been surprised more than once when it not only avoids the cliched predictions we\'re all familiar with, but actually subverts your expectations and presents them in a new light.For example, we\'ve all seen the classic ""man vs machine"" struggle played out in some story or another where a flesh and blood person strives to show that they can still overcome the flawless perfect machine. But very rarely have I ever seen anyone, myself included, consider that for someone who is a machine, their limits are predetermined and no amount of determination will change that.Any of the ideas put on display within the mere seven episodes that have released so far at the time that I\'m writing this can likely be the main focus of an entire story on its own, and I would very much love to see that. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of science fiction, especially because if there is enough popularity and demand for more sci-fi stories, then perhaps stories inspired by ideas within AI no Idenshi or new ones from other writers will be created. all about, Dr. Sudo Hikaru is a physician specializing in the treatment of humanoids and robots alike, while also moonlighting as an underground doctor for those who cannot seek legally treatment due to various circumstances.

Through the story of Dr. Sudou who specialises in treating humanoids, The Gene of AI explores the thorny philosophical and the morality of a future bordering on dystopian.Through his medical practice, Sudou hopes to find clues to the whereabouts of his humanoid mother's copied personality. Copying...a humanoid’s personality is very, very illegal in this world for very obvious moral reasons and it landed his mother in jail after she was naively tricked into handing over a copy by some corporate grifters. However, Sudou performs the role of a supporting character to the different patients he interacts with as the anime fleshes out its world through their different lives. Each episode focuses on one or two patients and the ethical struggles that come with being a humanoid as well as the pressures of the world around them.The show goes into fascinating detail over all sorts of topics such as memory and emotional erasure, illegal dating-sim software which allows someone to create an AI girlfriend of a real person instead of a fictional one, emotional support teddybears that don’t want to be abandoned, virus corruption, corporate abuse, even humanoid centric conspiracy theorists. All of these and more are explored deeply and uncomfortably making it an excellent almost anthology drama.That almost anthology structure does bite the show in its pacing depending on what the topic of the week is and what characters are involved. Sometimes a story doesn’t hit but because it's not an anthology you can’t skip it because it needs to build up the setting and to build up Sudou or his assisted Risa.Studio Madhouse clearly didn’t have a lot of staff to spare on this project as presumably most of them were working on Frieren and it has resulted in pretty flat and lifeless-looking art and animation. This is made up for in scene direction and the OST, but if you had told me this was a Madhouse production at first glance I wouldn’t have believed you.The Gene of AI is for a specific kind of sci-fi nerd who loves all the little details of a futurist world. Its art, animation and pacing have problems and it might not be able to hold the attention of those who don’t enjoy slow build-ups, but as a future that feels scarily in reach in our real world in 30-40 years if we all haven't died because of global warming, corporate greed, moron millionaires who fail at running social media companies, nuclear war, normal war, or whatever else could and probably will happen, it succeeds.6/10 It’s Okay. a humanoid’s personality is very, very illegal in this world for very obvious moral reasons and it landed his mother in jail after she was naively tricked into handing over a copy by some corporate grifters.

It’s called Pluto and it’s a very good manga that’s getting an adaptation coming out in October. AI no Idenshi is not that series, but it’s the one that could have been, as it presents a setting with artificial people living among humans, blending in in ways that on occasions the rest can’t tell much difference, while also the main character initially wants to know more about an underground illegal seller of artificial brains, or well, more like, a “fixer” of them, and possibly the one who ruined...his mom’s life.But this anime is really neither, as it deliberately keeps any more info of the protagonist than that as a secret to build some mystery around him up until the last episode, and thus that plot point doesn’t really go anywhere in this season, and since the source material for this consists of three manga at the moment, I think it’s safe to say that it won’t get resolved for some good time.What’s left of the series is a slice of life show exploring the interactions between humans and humanoids, in the likes of Eve no Jikan, only different because it came out in a different era. Since that other series is from 2008 to 2010, it was still showing some fear of technology, discrimination and indifference from humans to robots and some low level existential crisis for the androids since they did have a personality on their own on a specific place and would ponder about their relationships among themselves and with their human owners.It’s not the same with AI no Idenshi, as it was made on a time where technology is much different and present everywhere and at any moment in everyday life, with the fear of it pretty much being a thing of the past. Thus, its approach ranges from the existential to one more laid back and more of “what daily uses or routines robots and artificial intelligence would have “on their own”?” type of deal. That’s not bad per se, but it is certainly lacking in theme exploration when compared with the previous work.But that still doesn’t make it a not good anime, it would still be fine if it was a slice of life series with a small and recurring set of characters, like Eve no Jikan, but it isn’t, as it intends to show many different ones doing many different things, thus it can’t really flesh any of them properly. The most a character can get is one or even half an episode dedicated to themselves before being completely forgotten by the not plot in here, and even then, since the anime is more focused on what they do and how they do it, instead of the characters as themselves, there isn’t much characterization to speak of here either. Just take a look at the two mains, they don’t get the tiniest bit of fleshing up until the last two episodes, and even only a little bit of them is explored, and their backgrounds are revealed at almost the same time.But even then it would still be fine it there was an ongoing plot that somehow tied the mini stories, but it isn’t, that was discarded very early on. Ok, it would still be fine as an episodic slice of life sci-fi series if the stories where fine on their own. And in that regard the show is a mixed bag because it loves to self-sabotage itself for some reason. Did you like how in the first episode the anime set up questions about how valuable your memories are and how much do they make you for who you are, even if only a fraction of them are lost for your overall sake? Well, the second one is going to be about two dudes running and surpassing your own limits purely by will even when you shouldn’t be able to, oh, and a non-binary person speaking ill of a whole sex and gender despite previously being their own. Did you like how in the third episode two people are so attached to two robots, one made for company and another one being a toy, that they can’t tell them apart from real people, and how one of the latter even has an identity crisis for retaining data of a previous owner? Well, the next one is going to have lots of different mini stories about horny teenagers using technology for their perverted fantasies.And that’s the main problem of what and how the series is, even when disregarding everything that it could have been but isn’t, it’s a very mixed bag of mini stories where you can’t really know what level of quality you’ll get in the next episode, and even at its best, it would only be just decent, as its own approach doesn’t let it explore a concept on that much detail. Another issue is the tone, as AI no Idenshi is half the time a silly shounen comedy, thus almost no topic is looked into very seriously either. By comparison, Real Drive was also a lighthearted semi-episodic slice of life sci-fi series, but it knew when and how to explore its topics seriously, and it also had recurring characters and kind of a sort of an ongoing plot.At some point the series even seems to run out of worthy stories to tell, and instead of dedicating one whole story per episode, it starts showing two or more on each one, thus amplifying all of its issues that I already mentioned. Not even the background stories of the two main characters get a whole one, they are shown together in the last two episodes, and it comes off as sudden and rushed. The final one is good in terms of themes and showing a connection between the protagonist and other characters, but is obviously not a conclusion for the series in the least, as there are still far more manga chapters to adapt, and the whole season ended in a way that made it feel as just a buildup for stuff to come.It doesn’t help that the production and atmosphere of the series are also very average, with very plain looking artwork, backgrounds and special effects, simple and very limited character designs, and stiff animation, especially in the beginning, as well as just decent sound effects and music, but not the opening, which sucks. The series is half comical and half melancholic, and the intro seems to belong in Dimension W, screw that, the ending fits much better, I have a review coming out where I shit on unfitting songs. Even the voice acting feels off for some reason, I don’t know what it is but no character has a voice that’s completely fitting for them.As a whole, it’s a very lukewarm and inconsistent episodic slice of life sci-fi series that doesn’t dedicate itself much to a point before moving to another, with an uneven tone and very forgettable characters. It’s kind of watchable for being a type of show that didn’t come out in what feels like a long time, but other than that, it has nothing against many others of its kind that you can find out there. his mom’s life.But this anime is really neither, as it deliberately keeps any more info of the protagonist than that as a secret to build some mystery around him up until the last episode, and thus that plot point doesn’t really go anywhere in this season, and since the source material for this consists of three manga at the moment, I think it’s safe to say that it won’t get resolved for some good time.What’s left of the series is a slice of life show exploring the interactions between humans and humanoids, in the likes of Eve no Jikan, only different because it came out in a different era.

The conception of advanced technology at a level we have not yet seen in our real world.In Ai no Idenshi, the world and the beings that live there are completely technological, in addition to human beings, there are humanoids, coming from the advent and advancement of technology that I had mentioned and the anime's main theme is the dilemmas experienced on a daily basis. by these humans and the relationship of these problems with...the main character who, in turn, is a human whose job is to study, understand and medicate these humanoids and this generates interesting debates and thoughts, to say the least, whether for those who are just watching the anime , as well as for those who draw parallels with the real world and its technology.This in itself was a good point about this anime and would make me watch it anyway, however, the big (very big) problem with this anime was its disastrous production. The MadHouse studio did one of its worst jobs technically in this anime. The direction of the scenes failed to bring the necessary impact, taking away a lot of weight from the events. Animation completely stuck and without a hint of fluidity, also taking away the immersion of those watching. Even the sound aspects of this anime are bad, with the exception of its opening. I'm sorry to say that with the production this anime had, it's impossible to find it good.There was a breath of quality in the final 3 episodes, where 3 major plots are worked on, among them, the plot of the main character and it is the one that generates the good cliffhanger of this anime and this is what made me doubt whether to recommend it or not. .I believe that the best option is to follow the series through the manga, even without reading it, as the anime has proven to have script, worldbuilding and history.

Almost every company seems to be investing in AI, creating their own AI-based services, or otherwise experimenting with something in the fields of machine learning, computer intelligence, and other things. In all of this, the common people have been left mostly uniformed on how exactly everything worked, but fear of the unknown has filled the minds of many people in the wake of this AI boom. The Gene of AI came out at a perfect time to capitalize on these fears, but it does so in a way that...genuinely gets the viewer thinking about the future in a meaningful way.To start off, all of the audiovisual content is par for the course. None of the animation or character designs are particularly ground-breaking, but they didn’t really need to be. However, subtle changes like having different eyes for Humanoids and Humans are where this show shines. Furthermore, to match the tone of this series, the music is generally subdued and subtle, allowing the characters and events to take the forefront while also providing a mood fitting this futuristic, mysterious world.AI no Idenshi has a looser, episodic structure, which I feel lends itself perfectly to an anime of this subject matter. It does have reoccurring main characters in the form of Dr. Hikaru Sudou and his nurse Risa Higuchi, who are pretty compelling, but this series definitely shines more in telling its individual stories. Each episode chooses to focus on a different aspect of a future where AI is even more all around us than right now, not being afraid to delve deep into more philosophical questions regarding the nature of humanity and whether an artificially-created intelligence could ever match up to the real thing.The presentation of each story is done in an excellent manner. The introduction to the primary characters involved, exploring their circumstances, and presenting the audience with a question to think about the whole time (e.g. whether or not Humanoids with set limits can stand on an even playing field with Humans, who constantly have room for growth). Involving Sudou and Higuchi in these stories is also done in a way that doesn’t take the spotlight away from our episodic characters, but rather allows their story to develop further. Finally, we reach a few major plot points that provide some closure and end their arc, which in turn allows the audience to reach their conclusion.One thing that I would like to point out is how AI no Idenshi is completely willing to not answer the questions it poses in a way leaning to one side or the other. Don’t get me wrong: writers using their stories to express their personal philosophies, especially relating to politics, is definitely allowed and can be compelling; we’ve seen this in even the most unlikely works like One Piece. However, allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions is something that especially works for AI-related questions. All the episodes do is showcase a likely scenario in this hypothetical future and imagine how it would play out. It does not seek to plant an opinion in the viewer’s mind and wishes instead for them to see what is happening and use that to help form their own opinions.That being said, AI no Idenshi also does a very good job at making its primary story arc compelling, even in the face of all of these interesting self-contained stories. It executes it in such a way that makes it so that all of these stories acted as build-up to the conclusion of Sudou’s own story in the last few episodes. Even these explore the questions posed at the very beginning and provide multiple suitable answers. Unlike the episodic stories, however, we do see that our main story does have definitive answers, and that is okay. Aside from that, Risa also gets her own episodes, and these are very good as well for the reasons mentioned above.In general, AI no Idenshi seeks to explore what it means to be human, and how that could change in an alternate world. It is definitely not a unique idea to explore, and does it do it the best or most complex or most entertaining? No. However, it doesn’t necessarily have to, because that’s not what its goal is. It wishes to pose questions and seeks answers from its audience: What does it mean to be human? Is there any difference from a Human and a Humanoid—a robot that acts identically to a human? What are “feelings”? Do robots and AI also have feelings, or are those just based on what they’ve learned and how they’re programmed? All of these and more are explored here, and it does it really well.Especially in times like this, AI no Idenshi is a great show. You can call it topical or pandering due to its focus and nature, but I feel that this is what makes it great; it feels human (whatever that means). Of course, it can be a little quieter but more philosophical, so those looking for loud or laid-back shows should look elsewhere. For those ready to ponder reality and the future, this is for you.

I\'ve watched plenty of sci-fi works depicting how the future would look like with AI or robot developed beyond human intelligence. They usually get stuck up in the repetitive ""WHO AM I!? AM I EVEN HUMAN!>!>!!>?!?!?!"" idea, it gets boring real quick. However, by using an episodic formula facilitated by Sudo\'s clinic setting, AI no Idenshi goes around the idea with multiple scenarios and perspectives. There is a variety of characters of different issues, showing wider possibilities of the future AI.Not just that, the AIs in this anime have a distinct feature that separates it...from other AI fictions. That is, they are not limited to one type of body or level of intelligence. The majority of AIs in this anime are called Humanoids, pretty self-explanatory, but Humanoids do not have a steel frame wearing skinsuit like we usually envision. Rather, this future has developed some black magic that replicates the human body for these AIs to live within. Humanoids grow, age, fall ill, are physically limited and die in similar fashion to humans. This distinct feature opens up a lot more fresh ideas for the story.AI no Idenshi also has this conservative flavor in writing its characters and script. Most of the characters are very normal, thus realistic. They don\'t yap about their thoughts 24/7 or do comedic skits randomly. They don\'t suffer from the wacky anime tropes. It\'s one of those old school writing, you know, like Monster. There\'s just a mature tone to it. It\'s not entirely cold and boring though. As Risa, a young girl with a cheery and expressive personality, plays a major role in the anime. She is the one who yaps about her thought a little too much, which serves as a good balance to Sudo\'s cold quiet boring behavior. I love Risa. She\'s so damn cute. Long twin tails are so damn cute OMFG. I may have overlooked her flaws due to my bias.Finally, there is one thing about this anime which may be a hit or miss for viewers. With each episode presenting two stories, that may or may not be connected at all, AI no Idenshi almost never concludes its story with a definitive answer. It constantly brings up a question, and viewers will not get a revelation or satisfaction. The objective of the story is to present the possibility, not to send a moral message. AI no Idenshi is extremely bad at hiding this too. The stories can just end without a cool one-liner or musical exit. One anime that\'s extremely good at closing its melodramatic episode with one-liner is Cowboy Bebop. It also helps that Cowboy Bebop has the hardest ED in anime history. So viewers may find AI no Idenshi\'s endings abrupt and incomplete, leaving a bad aftertaste. In its defense though, too many one-liners get obviously corny and they don\'t have a genius to make a banger ED.""Doug, you\'re a fantastic speaker. What\'s your secret?""

Instead of focusing on the interesting ideas of ""what is the legal status of AI people"" and ""how does a society treat a new class of people"" it wants to go through what ifs and not develop them.The show has one or two good ideas that I really liked, the episode where a dude makes an AI version of his high school crush for sexual reasons is a...good idea, but is not taken to the terrifying extent that ""the most extreme version of revenge porn"" could be. I feel this is an apt metaphor for the show, some good ideas without the ability to engage with them. good idea, but is not taken to the terrifying extent that ""the most extreme version of revenge porn"" could be.

In that area it fails.Still, if you want to see the challenges humanity could have if AI becomes even better, I recommend you watch it. Just don\'t expect the main plot - anime part to be...good. good.', ""The 1st episode of the show I really enjoyed because of it didn't feel drawn out and there was a main focus on the MC but it wasn't super in your face about his motives on helping people so it felt a bit like a mystery. It started off strong with it slowly becoming a bit emotional but not super sappy. I was invested in the people that the MC was helping. I enjoyed the idea of would I be the same person if I became a new me. The concept of seeing a loved one as they were and now knowing they are and...wont ever truly be the same is an idea that I think most people would find interesting.The 2nd episode start off a little less strong but found the idea that what if I could be something other then me interesting. I thing that wondering if being something other then you would make you a better version of yourself (as in improving on things you wish you could through others) was a nice leeway into what the show is trying to accomplish. I saw a review of this show mainly being about what ifs and I would have to agree. All of the show so far is what if I changed. This episode dragged on a bit to long with the side characters and I felt like not much had changed since the MC wasn't really involved. I wasn't really invested in the side characters which made me a little sad since the first episode was pretty good at having me care about the side characters.The 3rd episode made me interested right off the bat on why androids was burring a human and then it was a dream. Then it completely caught me off guard by bringing in the robots since the girl had a boyfriend robot. Like aren't android robots? What is the higher achy of humans compared to androids or robots? Are robots like slaves or pets or something? Is there disclination towards androids and robots? What are some more medical problems that androids have compared to humans since it seems like that are similar to humans but not quiet human. I do enjoy the idea they were going for in this episode where the mother feels that the toy bear she had bought for her son is giving him emotional support while she cant do that since she works so much, which in turn is causing her to resent the bear. It brings up the question of if technology is really worth it when it could cause you to lose a connection with those you love. I wanted to be emotional went he bear bot hit by the car but I do apricate how there was closer for him. I still don't know why the girl had that dream since it wasn't brought up and the robot boyfriend she had left after while. I think this epodes was focused on trying to move forward but it just was a bit incohesive. overall it the show was a bit drawn out, didn't really focused on the main character, and lacked a good since of pace for world building and how the world operated. Good concept not so great exicution. That's how most anime are. I do wish I would have felt more for this anime since form the first episode it seemed like it would take intriguing concepts similar to Wonder Egg Priority (the animation in this shows definitely wasn't as good though). wont ever truly be the same is an idea that I think most people would find interesting.The 2nd episode start off a little less strong but found the idea that what if I could be something other then me interesting.

I went into this blind and, being somewhat 'funned out' by the whole AI hype, wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised.From the onset it appears to be about humanoids, human-like AI beings, and their issues. But in truth its more about the human response to artificial intelligence and how we deal with the 'uncanny valley' we've found ourselves in. There's a saying: When you gaze into the abyss, it gazes back at you. Our response to challenges, uncertainty and 'otherness' is a reflection of who we...are as an individual and as a species. We are so self absorbed that even our evaluation of AI has become a quest to discover who we are.Story:It's divided into sub-stories per episode, dealing with different themes. Sometimes I felt it suffered a bit by taking on too much and not having enough time to fully explore each subject. But almost each episode left me with food for thought. Main plot holds intrigue and I look forward to season 2.Characters:It takes a while to warm up to Hikaru (MC). He has a clinical mind and is rather reserved, your typical 'emotionally unavailable' male character. Seeing tid-bits of something deeper was my catnip.

Not anymore, this anime has realized that dream.For me this is the 1st anime I have actually learnt anything from........that is after excluding life lessons from SoL anime and somethings about Japanese history.The anime is pretty funny and most of the episodes (especially towards the end of the series) left me smiling.The jokes seem to have a pattern though: most of the times settings are introduced and then suddenly twisted into a joke.......even so, they are enjoyable and 20 ep which are just 5 mins long are not enough to get you bored of...that pattern.The anime is short and enjoyable, so even if you want to just relax, you can watch this show.So, what do we learn? The anime informs you about mental illnesses/stresses and tells us how we can deal with them. The problems they talk about are around us and some of them wouldn't even be usually considered as mental illness (like some of the problems are just as simple as stress or even fear/laziness of getting up and going to work/school). So, the things they talk about can be useful to us (even if we do not have any mental illness.)Each episode is just 5 min long and deals with a particular problem. The information is very easy to digest as it is imparted in a cheerful and comical manner.Story (7): The anime almost has no story. Whatever little story it has is a setting used to impart information and be a joke at the same time.Art and Sound (7): Good enough for the purpose of this anime.Characters (7): The characters are enjoyable to watch and weird enough to be funny. Again good enough for the purpose of the anime.Enjoyment and Overall (9): I am rating this 9 because the anime has cleared its objective of explaining things and creating more awareness of mental illness in a fun way. Even otherwise I enjoyed the jokes a lot.This isn't a super awesome anime (arguably like Code Geass or Death Note). Nor does this make you board the feels train (again arguable like Anohana or Angel Beats). It is a short and funny anime which is also informative.You can watch it only for the joke or only for the info or both. I do not think that you would regret watching this anime. that pattern.The anime is short and enjoyable, so even if you want to just relax, you can watch this show.So, what do we learn? The anime informs you about mental illnesses/stresses and tells us how we can deal with them. The problems they talk about are around us and some of them wouldn't even be usually considered as mental illness (like some of the problems are just as simple as stress or even fear/laziness of getting up and going to work/school). So, the things they talk about can be useful to us (even if we do not have any mental illness.)Each episode is just 5 min long and deals with a particular problem. The information is very easy to digest as it is imparted in a cheerful and comical manner.Story (7): The anime almost has no story. Whatever little story it has is a setting used to impart information and be a joke at the same time.Art and Sound (7): Good enough for the purpose of this anime.Characters (7): The characters are enjoyable to watch and weird enough to be funny. Again good enough for the purpose of the anime.Enjoyment and Overall (9): I am rating this 9 because the anime has cleared its objective of explaining things and creating more awareness of mental illness in a fun way.

I like the fact it was detailing anxiety, sleep disorders, depression, anything that relates to various mental illnesses in a light way. However it wouldve been better off if the dirty jokes were kept at a minimum as they were getting boring awful quickly. Not to mention, some of the characters were getting on my nerves, especially the girls working in the clinic like seriously, were pretty much pointless characters.....Also I gotta say, fairplay to Shinichiro Miki for playing as the doctor and Yurika...Endou as the nurse. Their voices really matched well to their characters personalities, it's just too bad the other characters weren't that likeable as them and the jokes on this anime were just overkill tbh. I know what humour is and isn't but the humour here was just dead to me unfortunately.Just be aware it's nothing special, it's just really all about talk and trying to be forcefully funny when it's not.

The comical humor for this anime short ranges from ""meta-ecchi"" jokes, character jabs and just plain old pop culture references through puns or the references appearing in the meta sense, due to this your comedy WILL vary as it can quickly change from ecchi jokes to actually talking about mental disorders with some puns thrown in/character jabs. The runtime for each episode is 5 minutes long thus you can get through this anime short in no less...than 2 hours. The characters are pretty typical of anime although wacky in their own quirky ways as well, such as Ryou who is the main exposition guy but isn\'t given the screentime due to the meta-fanservice in the way to the ditzy Asuna making puns and comically jabbing at Ryou to one of Asuna\'s sister and one of the other three assistants of Ryou, Iyashi voiced by \'\'Yoko Hisaka\'\' being the shameless sadist fanservice girl to the last of Asuna\'s sisters Himeru voiced by \'\'Maaya Uchida\'\' being the shy depressed eccentric one, LA\'s favourite would have to have been Asuna only because of the awkward puns she makes diverting the attention from Ryou almost instantly. The animation is ""ok"" from the character designs to the barely there backgrounds unless a reference is needed.

Listening to a normal explanation is boring!The anime series is full of tsukommis (comebacks) and is defiantly in the comedy genre.It is very informative; in fact most of the facts stated in the series is reliable but for further in depth information it would be best to visit a psychological clinic!None the less; I enjoyed watching this series and looked forward to each release.I greatly HOPE that there is a sequel to this series!

Each episode has a different ""disorder"" they talk about, and although you do learn some valuable information, it\'s honestly just 5 minutes of hilarious puns and innuendos that have no real purpose. The Psychiatrist Ryou is easily overshadowed by the Kangoshi sisters who act as his nurses throughout the episodes. Whether it\'s themselves or their grandfather, they\'re always causing trouble and miscommunication for the Doctor! Though each episode is only 5 minutes long, there are 20 episodes packed full of laughter. Once you start watching, it\'ll be hard for you not to sit through the whole season! I highly...recommend this gag series if you\'re looking for something light and quick to watch between series.

NOTHING!!), with five minutes running time per episode. Comical Psychosomatic Medicine (CPM) also uses somewhat good humor. Not exactly SFW, but not exactly 100% appalling (well, depending on who you are and what exactly offends you.

The first episode starts with an uncomfortable medical subject - erectile disfunction, and the show does not relent in its ensuing episodes.It's an educational show discussing many psychosomatic topics (psychology in usual western terms I suppose).

There are 6 sword eyes (white, red, purple, yellow, green and blue), those who have the...sword symbol in right eye represent light and to have it in left eye meant to be of dark forces.

Given that the one place to watch the show is on youtube, and the uploader didn't put in the opening (due to copyright), that shouldn't be a big problem unless you search for it.This series is about battle spirits yet again, but this time, the spirits don't originate from Grand Rolo; it's not connected to Dan/Brave. The show is very plot focused, and has a lot of characters (the quote unquote 12 sword eyes, plus quite a few others).Story: 9....This is a two parter show, that got separated for... no real reason, I assume. I'd give the story of this part a 9; it establishes the world well, the plot, the conflict, the events.. Since I'm not going to write a review for the second part, let me say that it doesn't worsen, but since it focuses more on the conclusion of the story, there aren't many more interesting ideas or locations that are brought (8/10).Art: Good, 7/10.Sound: No clue. The OP isn't bad, I don't remember the ED, the ending of the show has no music (copyright), and I forgot about the normal soudtrack, so I assume it's okay.Character: I'd give an 8. There are too many characters for all of them to develop, but the show tries, and to me, succeeds. The MC, Yaiba (altough he doesn't develop as a character, he develops to the viewer), the purple sword eyes, the yellow sword eyes of darkness, the white and green sword eyes of light.. Most of those I listed are characters that I think are well executed.Enjoyment: There's one thing that really annoyed me from the show, and brings my enjoyment to a 9, and my total score to an 8 (as opposed to a 10 and 9 respectably). That's the stakes. In a card game anime, you need stakes for each card game, or else it all feels pointless. Here, (slight spoilers for one of the first 10 episodes), they sometimes establish the stake, but, for good reasons, make the protagonists lose. However, due to the stakes being too high, they just back out of it. The way it's executed isn't bad, but it's something that I really don't respect. This happens more than once.All in all, I'd give it a solid 8. I'd recommend to anyone who would like adventure and an intriguing story, and who likes card games.FYI, the card game aspect is explained at the beggining of the show, and you should be able to get the hang of it.

Unfortunately, B-Daman has only gotten more boring since the original...show as now there are no more Direct Hit Battles!Seriously, what is more exciting: two guys trying to shoot each other or two guys shooting targets? I can only assume the writers didn't include DH Battles in Crossfire because they didn't want kids hurting each other in real life by shooting marbles at each other. However, DH Battles were the most exciting feature of the original show and without them now every battle is nothing more than watching kids shoot marbles at blocks or pins!Art 6/10The art is definitely what has improved the most since the original show. I like how now when characters battle each other now these monsters called B-Animals appear. It definitely makes the battles cooler.Also, I just love Ruri's design; those bunny ears she wears whenever she referees a battle are so adorable.Characters 6/10I like Ricky's positive and determined attitude and I also like the friendship he develops with his B-Daman Dracyan, because B-Daman can talk now.Naoua is a good villain; I like how cunning and deceitful he is and how he has this pathological desire to control everyone.Although, Natsumi wasn't in every episode, I though she was still a funny comic relief given how over excited she can get about things.Overall 5/10While I think Crossfire improved B-Daman with the inclusion of B-Animals and the fact B-Daman can talk now, I still feel like is was a real detriment to the show eliminating Direct Hit Battles.

I like how now when characters battle each other now these monsters called B-Animals appear. It definitely makes the battles cooler.Also, I just love Ruri's design; those bunny ears she wears whenever she referees a battle are so adorable.Characters 6/10I like Ricky's positive and determined attitude and I also like the friendship he develops with his B-Daman Dracyan, because B-Daman can talk now.Naoua is a good villain; I like how cunning and deceitful he is and how he has this pathological desire to control everyone.Although, Natsumi wasn't in every episode, I though she was still a funny comic relief given how over excited she can get about things.Overall 5/10While I think Crossfire improved B-Daman with the inclusion of B-Animals and the fact B-Daman can talk now, I still feel like is was a real detriment to the show eliminating Direct Hit Battles. I'd recommend Medabots or Bakugan over this.""]"
Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28833/Chain_Chronicle__Haecceitas_no_Hikari,"['Okay let me say first that i really enjoyed this show so i\'m obviously biased but who cares if i\'m biased?The story is simple and philosophically deep but lacking at the same time, that\'s probably the only weak point of this show for me. I really do wish they do more on the story department but given the source material, there really wasn\'t much.The ""Black King"" starts with the concept that ""the world will end one day"". Which is true, we know everything and everyone dies. Even the Sun that can lives for billions of years will die one day. *Everything is destine to ends*...that\'s the message.But another thing is also true, we as a humanity will try to survive even if everything is going to end, even for only a small amount of time. Which is ""Hope"" represented by the Protagonists.The story is not about ""good vs bad"" as many people mistakenly taken it to be. It\'s about ""Hope vs Despair"" which is similar but not exactly the same and that\'s the key point that this show has taken my heart. that\'s the message.But another thing is also true, we as a humanity will try to survive even if everything is going to end, even for only a small amount of time.

It\'s about ""Hope vs Despair"" which is similar but not exactly the same and that\'s the key point that this show has taken my heart.', 'Mobile game adaptations are few and far in between, and they all fall into one of two categories.  Either they\'re of average quality yet manage to garner a huge amount of popularity due to its characters (Kancolle/Love Live), or no one gives two shits about them because they\'re so bad no one cares (Girlfriend Kari).  So, how does Chain Chronicle, the lovechild between Alim and Sega that no longer has any global servers on the west coast because fuck you westerners, fare in all of this?Story: Alright, because the anime doesn\'t give any context, and various synopsis\' beyond ""This is an adaptation of...a game"" definitely don\'t help, here\'s the story of Chain Chronicle in a nutshell.  The world has the looming threat of blackness threatening to cover the world in its evil.  The Black King of all of this is the source, and it\'s up to Yuuri (aka the player character given a face) to stop him.  Along the way, you meet a girl named Phoena who has lost her memory carrying a book known as the \'Chain Chronicle\', and a sprite named Pirika, as well as various other characters that you\'ll meet through the use of gacha roll.  So now that you\'ve gotten your merry band of RNG rolled units, fight through hordes of nameless enemies and fight the Black King.  Have fun.That was a quick rundown of the start of Chain Chronicle.  The start of the anime is a bit more complicated.  The anime starts at the end of the story that I explained above and eventually leads into the second half of the story where the situation of the world is dire, and Yuuri must find his bearing and return to fight the Black King again.  The initial problem here is the assumption that the viewer knows what the hell is going on at the start.  The show thrusts you into the action without any word of warning, before continuing on with a journey that was started without the audience even knowing.  I\'m not sure what went through the creators\' heads when they started to make this, because everything from the world to what\'s happening is made to feel already established some time previous when it\'s barely even past episode two.Another issue is the pacing.  The beginning is very sluggish, as the show inches its way to making any form of progress before speeding up through the plot through the use of deus ex machina in order to make any form of progression happen, and the end is very fast paced as it tries to rush itself to the end.  This is due to the fact that the series has its characters in the majority of its episodes just travel from one place to another with the occasional conflict in between to make it feel like there\'s something actually happening, before creating a large total conflict to make it seem like everything is on the line.  This, combined with the generic plotline of a hero and his band of friends fighting the evil king at the end of the journey, makes the whole viewing experience feel bland and boring to watch.Overall, Chain Chronicle: Light of Haecceitas is a mishmash of fantasy tropes traveling long hours in a fantasy setting with fantasy characters fighting the big evil fantasy guy at the end who wants to destroy everything because people suck and he doesn\'t like it.  Its message is typical shonen friend crap, its plot is predictable, no one that matters dies (surprise surprise), and it\'s just...not at all a fun watch cause there\'s nothing interesting about it.Overview:- Generic fantasy adventure- Terrible start because they throw the audience into the fire- Uneven pacing- Way too much deus ex machinaCharacters:  Fantasy characters with shonen tropes!  Yeah, that about sums them up.Yuuri is...one of our main characters.  As the player character tasked with being the player\'s in-game representation and by \'recruiting\' people through the use of in-game microtransactions that may or may not give you the character that you want (oh how I feel that pain), Yuuri is...not interesting at all.  He fights for his friends, on the side of good, and halfway through the series, doubts himself and manages to pull off an extremely \'meh\' character change that doesn\'t amount to anything in the end.Aram is the other main character in this series.  Despite having a character design that I\'m actually quite fond of, Aram\'s character leaves a lot to be desired.  He\'s basically a brasher version of Yuuri, as he holds the same morals and ideals as his friend.  Does this make him a better character in any way?  No.  Does this make him interesting?  No.  Will we be moving on to our last character?  Yes.Then there\'s Phoena who\'s literally just there.  Phoena doesn\'t really play much of a big part in this series and is more or less there because she\'s the heroine and holds the Chain Chronicle, the brick of text this series is named after.  She plays a bit like a damsel in distress as she cannot fight and is stuck to the role as that one girl who screams out the protagonist\'s name whenever the situation for them looks dire, and only becomes relevant to the series when the book she clutches to her chest is involved.Every other character is just one fantasy trope after another.  The brave knight, the fallen knight, the holy queen, the evil bitch who\'s basically naked, the healer, the archer, the big scary evil guy who turns into a dragon at the end (why is this a common trope), the good dragon, the songstress, old sages, pervy sage, various mages, weaponmasters, someone who actually is naked (they even point this out), the conquerer guy, etc, etc.  The majority of these characters are either skin deep NPCs that do one thing for the plot before becoming irrelevant, or are members of the gacha that you could \'potentially\' (cause let\'s be real, you\'re not gonna get them) roll and add to your squad.Overview:+/- Fantasy tropes.  Entertaining?  Yes.  Good characters?  No.Art: Produced by Telecom Animation Film, Chain Chronicle actually doesn\'t look all too bad.  Granted it\'s more or less standard fare for this age of animation, but the art and action are all fairly well done and consistent.For one thing, the show manages to pull off CGI well enough to not create a clear contrast with the handdrawn scenes, and they show off the game\'s mana system and chain battle system pretty well.  (In a nutshell, you get orbs to do super attacks.  Doing multiple super attacks in succession has better effects.)  Not only that, but the sheer ridiculousness of the majority of the character designs are well done as well.  Yes, while the fantasy outfits that these characters wear both look ridiculous and impractical for battle, they look pretty nice.Overview:+ Consistent art+ Detailed designs+ CGI doesn\'t clashSound:  On the flipside, the OST isn\'t great.  Both the OP and ED are these rock songs that aren\'t very enjoyable to listen to.  They feel extremely average and there\'s nothing lost in skipping them.Personal Enjoyment: I played Chain Chronicle while they had servers over in the west.  Alim closed the servers long ago, so playing the game in the west is now impossible.  Though I didn\'t play for long, the residual memory of my experience with it got me excited when I saw that there was going to be an adaptation.  And after I saw it?  I\'m thoroughly disappointed.  This adaptation is strange because not only does it begin halfway through the main story, but they just compiled the Chain Chronicle movies into an anime adaptation.  The strange circumstances combined with what part of the story they decided to adapt almost made me feel like they didn\'t really care when they made this because everything felt thrown together.  Safe to say, I was not impressed with this anime and it was not worth the time to watch.Did I like this anime?Well...I like some of the character designs?  That\'s something I guess.What didn\'t I like about this anime?I hated how boring it felt.  The entire show was just characters moving from one place to another before the big fight at the finale.  This with the lack of world building due to the fact that the show feels like it expects you to know what\'s going on and who is whom makes the hard for those unfamiliar with the series to watch.  I believe an adaptation should be able to be viewed by all, and the fact that Chain Chronicle doesn\'t do that makes it seem like they only did this for those who were fans of the series.  Which makes sense, but you\'d still want to try and get new people into it too, right?Would I recommend this anime?To both people who have or haven\'t played the game, no.  This show is not worth your time, as its bland character motivations and sluggish plot progression don\'t do anything imaginative or interesting beyond \'this is what\'s going on.\'  If you want something fantasy, I\'d highly suggest watching something else because nothing about this is good.

The anime started off with the bad guy actually triumph over the good guy, and the land is slowly turning into darkness. Yet per usual, that would not stop our band of heroes from trying to stop the villains, because hey, who else gonna do it right? It is a purely adventure anime set in the fantasy world (finally without the isekai elements) and a good one at that. The animation is really good, especially in every fight scene, and it feels like some kind of...rpg video games at time. The movie version is basically the first 4 episode of the anime, so for people who have already watched it, just wait and skip to ep 5. Picked up because I really thirst for some good adventure anime. rpg video games at time.

Picked up because I really thirst for some good adventure anime.', '**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**Chain Chronicle is an adaptation of a mobile game of the very same name. The mobile game has been adapted into a short ova and a movie trilogy, and that movie trilogy has now been broken down into a 12 ep anime (or maybe is what the other way around). Anyway coming into this i wasn\'t sure how to approach it either by the movies or the tv series, so I choose the slow burner method and picked the tv series.The beginning of the show puts you immediately in the thick of a large battle which I believe for the characters...is the final grand battle against the dark king (or whatever his name was). However, by the end of the battle the heroes have lost the battle and the dark king has now grown more powerful than ever. The army now disbanded the group of heroes now have to regroup, and find another way to defeat the dark king and convince the army to fight once more.Very few anime that I know have the protagonist and his group lose a key battle especially so it being the very first episode. However by doing so the show loses many vital things such as world building and the buildup that could have happened for the battle making it feel like I somehow skipped over the first or so seasons. I guess that the first part of the story is in the mobile game, but an anime has to stand on its own in order to be considered a proper adaptation and not one long glorified infomercial.The world building is lost in the sense that the viewer has no idea what is going on in the world other than there\'s a dark king and different factions and races uniting together, but none of these are explored in the anime. As for the buildup they lost it in the sense that it would have been better if the first ""final battle"" was built up yet they lost the battle at the mid way point, and for them to do it again, and have the viewers think whether or not they can they really pull it off this time despite all the build up from last time. However since we just skip over that, now you already get a feeling that they will succeed which lowers the tension of the show.The show pretty much boils down to the characters trying to have the faction rejoin and find another way to take down the king, they meet a kid who resembles the protagonists. There\'s some ""betrayal"" in the group, there\'s some battles yet they all look the same, and the final battle that ends with one of the main characters raseganing the big bad, the end, oh and every one is ok. The story felt incomprehensible at points as I believe that the show was made for people who already have knowledge of what is going on. However even though I had liitle idea what was going on, even I know that there was a lot of bullshit going on in the story with characters popping in and out of nowhere in order for the plot to keep moving forward, and made the story feel rushed just to get it over with.The same reasoning I had for the story can also be applied to the characters since you needed to have played the game in order to have a grasp of most the characters. The titular characters in the show are the three main protagonist Yuri the hero swordsman, Arma an ""interesting"" thief, Phoena, the chronicle cleric. Then there\'s Juliana a princess, Shuza the leader of the ogres, and I guess burckhardt the princess bodyguard. Everyone else one else is one-note either filling in some character class, or as elders/ guardians of a location. He shows has a huge roster of characters but none of them are decently fleshed out or if they ever get fleshed out at all( i guess you have to check the game).Yuri the hero was a somewhat interesting character in the start of the story after having lost in the ""final"" battle has sort of a ptsd like effect on him, and has doubt if he\'s worthy to become a hero to the point of siding with the dark king, but this gets swept under the rug fast because what was causing it all along was magic~~~. The same happens to burckhardt as a foreshadowing, but he wasn\'t much of a character in the first place. Arma our ""newest""companion (like the others weren\'t new enough) joins the group and has a power that is rather convenient for the story, not much is looked into him other than being another shounen like protagonist. Phoena ,who is waifu material, is the keeper of the chronicle and also the daughter of the king which would be very interesting plot point but is glossed over. Also it\'s her and yuris fault for failing in the first place because if they waited just a little more maybe they could have taken him down with the help of the rest of the group. Juliana and Shuza are just leaders of to large groups ones ""kind"" ones a ""dick"" respectively. There\'s nothing notable about the antagonists the dark king just comes off as a half price pain from naruto, and there\'s also a demon lady who convinces the characters to be evil. They\'re just evil for the sake of evil. the betrayers have more depth than them, and that\'s not saying much.For a commercial it\'s pretty good for modern anime standard. I do like the character designs as they were made by the same person who did Maoyū Maō Yūsha(which you should watch instead of this). There\'s notable usage of CGI for the dragons and the action scenes, but nothing bad upon the eyes. The background is okay, but as I said before in the world building since there\'s none of it here all the places just seem like a generic fantasy setting and the locations as set pieces. This shows even more in the large battles which all seem to all take place in large gray areas with a dark skyin terms of sound, it\'s very good for a fantasy anime. It has the triumphed music for when the characters are winning. Some despairing music when the characters are in a jam some whimsical fantasy village and inn music during the lighthearted moments, and all of this wrapped up with one singing elf. The voice acting is also fine as well.In the end I gave up taking this ""seriously*, and just laughed at all the bullshit that came my wayOverall- it\'s a 3/10 as an anime, but a 10/10 for a commercial for a product I will never buy.\ufeff is the final grand battle against the dark king (or whatever his name was).

After the mobile game shut down their servers after introducing fans to the world of Yggdra many fans had to say goodbye to the colourful cast of characters, but can now experience the vibrant world in a new light.The story follows an alternative events where the Volunteer Army fails to defeat the Black king in the final battle of the game. Confronted with this, they must deal broken alliance and the frayed hope of the nation. As the they regroup and lick their wounds a potential new recruit enters the fray.Story = 7Like all modern fantasy, the influence of Tolkien's...work can be found mixed in the usual slew of anime tropes for good measure. Game mechanics are added quite well into the story and do not seem to interfere or drag the plot down.The story does, however, suffer most in the first episode, as it was clearly made for fans of the game, no backstory beyond a short introduction is given. Any outsiders to this may find the beginning slightly confused as you are thrown directly into Final Battle of the game itself. By the time opening theme starts, they story breaks new ground and all the interesting stuff begins to happen.Art = 9The art of the show really stays true to that of the mobile game. Characters have been faithfully adapted along with stunning backgrounds. It also makes use of 3D models mixed with the overall 2D art style (a nod to the 3D models in the game perhaps?). New takes on environments are presented and game locations are expanded to fit into the paradigm of the show.All in all, the animation studio has done a fantastic job of incorporating a substantial amount of game art and expanding it into a believable, living world.Sound = 7Admittedly, not much to say. The soundtrack suits each location effectively and the opening theme makes you want mash some baddie's face in; so job done right?Character = 8This was the strongest point of the game for me, characters each had a rich background and were very likeable. The most boring character was the 'Hero', which the anime addresses to perfection. Gone is the mostly silent protagonist without a name and enter the newly dubbed Yuri, a character that has to deal with the burden's of loss and the need for hope.Also, any (though it still is early) we may yet get the much Googled and sought after character arc of the fallen hero. This is based on the general direction of the series and the poster for Part 3 of the movie. Rejoice fans of Kaneki Ken and Darth Vader, we might just have a keeper on hands!Enjoyment = 10I loved the game, I love the anime. There is no doubt I'm giving this a ten, call me a fan boy if you want. The new perspectives on the characters I followed for two years only made me love this more, I'll even buy the T-shirt.Joking aside, the anime makes for a great action adventure show. The characters and artwork stays faithful to the source material and a good adaptation. I would happily recommend it to anyone looking for a good fantasy or adventure tale.Overall = 8I will admit, there is a certain amount of bias here. Chain chronicle to me was an introduction to the world of Japanese animation, and really sparked my passion for it. Any fans of the game may also feel abounded joy of the return of Chain Chronicle, while other viewers might not get what the heck we're going on about.I would recommend this anime to anyone without a doubt, putting aside the first episode's pandering to returning fans, the following episodes make for a good anime. So, please, give it a go.[I will post recommendations for the anime as new episodes are released. Good to have you back!] work can be found mixed in the usual slew of anime tropes for good measure. Game mechanics are added quite well into the story and do not seem to interfere or drag the plot down.The story does, however, suffer most in the first episode, as it was clearly made for fans of the game, no backstory beyond a short introduction is given. Any outsiders to this may find the beginning slightly confused as you are thrown directly into Final Battle of the game itself. By the time opening theme starts, they story breaks new ground and all the interesting stuff begins to happen.Art = 9The art of the show really stays true to that of the mobile game. Characters have been faithfully adapted along with stunning backgrounds. It also makes use of 3D models mixed with the overall 2D art style (a nod to the 3D models in the game perhaps?). New takes on environments are presented and game locations are expanded to fit into the paradigm of the show.All in all, the animation studio has done a fantastic job of incorporating a substantial amount of game art and expanding it into a believable, living world.Sound = 7Admittedly, not much to say. The soundtrack suits each location effectively and the opening theme makes you want mash some baddie's face in; so job done right?Character = 8This was the strongest point of the game for me, characters each had a rich background and were very likeable. The most boring character was the 'Hero', which the anime addresses to perfection. Gone is the mostly silent protagonist without a name and enter the newly dubbed Yuri, a character that has to deal with the burden's of loss and the need for hope.Also, any (though it still is early) we may yet get the much Googled and sought after character arc of the fallen hero. This is based on the general direction of the series and the poster for Part 3 of the movie.

Despite the fact that in my opinion Ishida Akira (whom I admire) is not meant to be Yuri's voice.The characters are very numerous and detailed: congratulations to the character-design team who had to work very hard.I enjoyed this anime because even if it is a...basic story, it remains good and pleasant to follow.FR-L'histoire est plûtot classique et ennuyante.

As well as without the knowledge of the Movie adaptations nor playing the game of Chain Chronicle.Chain Chronicle: Light of Haecceitas revolves around Yuri, Aram, Phoena and the Black King Suppression Army in dealing and fighting against the Black King and his Army.In the first episode, we saw a glimpse of Yuri and the others losing to the Black King. So basically, the whole plot of the series is gathering back again the others in order to try to defeat again the Black King. Did it went smoothly the second time around?...Find out for yourself.Like I said before, since it was based on a game don't expect much of a storyline. Though the story ins't that great and kinda feels pathetic, the animations and fight scenes was damn great. It overhauls for its poor storyline. It kinda feels like I'm playing a video game. The soundtrack is good as well. Especially the opening and ending themes.Another thing about this anime is that we've been introduced to too many extra characters that doesn't blend well to the story. Especially in the latter part of the anime.Overall, it was a decent anime to me. It is not highly recommended but it can at least be on your watch list for its superb animation and soundtrack as well as a decent amount of enjoyment.

Yes, the story may have turned into a darker path but I enjoyed it as to how it shows that the franchise itself had grown and matured to tackle on a darker light.While it\'s a shameless attempt into pulling anime fans into the game, it is indeed actually recommended that you finish Book 1 and as many character story possible. You will appreciate all the anime has to offer. For one, Julianna\'s story line in the game was actually one of the driving force for her to take on the Throne.

Aram is really a big ass pull character. I wished his backstory and how his powers came to be was explained more clearly.I hope this somehow helped you into reconsidering to rewatch the series with all the points in mind.

The narrative begins at an end and continues from there, fulfilling its own promise of an unending battle of hope and belief against anguish and doubt.A boyhood adventure told through an epic narrative, Chronicle will no doubt disappoint someone looking for a groundbreaking, genre-defining series. It never promises to be that and the first few minutes of the series make that evident. The rogue, the tank, and the fighter, supported by their healer and the feminine...foil confront a great evil and despite their wholehearted efforts, they fall short. So begins our story, an ""Odyssey"" rather than an ""Iliad"". Like the greater epic\'s narrative that influences this, the writers assume you can tell who the characters are from design. The core characters see face-value development to satisfy the narrative, the trials and tribulations they face as they struggle to face their ultimate enemy are metaphors overcome by the timely arrival of an ally and the heroes\' innate heroism. The hero dallies with Circe, overcomes the temptation into nihilism, and returns triumphant with his romanticism restored.Chronicle delivers on its promise: an action filled, grand-scale story with a satisfying ending. It reaffirms what its audience is told to believe and redemption for those who fall promises the doubters among us are not yet lost. The animation is well-done, the soundtrack impressive enough to carry along the simplicity of the story, and the characters fulfill their roles without fail. Chronicle is a 12-episode romantic narrative, ideals of faith, belief, and fellowship cast into a group of characters we already know without knowing them themselves.Enjoy Chronicle for what it is and accept, as the writers did, that it is not special, unique, or particularly well-developed. It doesn\'t need to be. Chronicle retells a story told for thousands of years and does it with enough bells and whistles to keep the audience engaged. Some serious moments fall painfully flat, the dialogue is laughable at times, and the trope abuse overwhelming for those unwilling to lose themselves in its romanticism. For the rest of us, willing to suspend our jaded, postmodern skepticism and need for elaborate, painstakingly contriving magic performances, Chronicle is a satisfying, self-fulfilling stage and worth the 6 hours invested. foil confront a great evil and despite their wholehearted efforts, they fall short.

But man, they really screwed up the anime at some points and made it a little less enjoyable than I expected it to be.PLOT & STORY LINE 📜---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The first and probably the major issue that this show has is that the first episode looks like a mid-seasonal highlight. You play the episode and out of nowhere you have the protagonist fighting alongside his companions against the main villain of the show. He wants some...sacred book, the world is becoming dark, some fairy (that seems very important) suddenly disappears and you\'re just watching and thinking...wait what? I had the feeling that I missed out on something and I did. It has a prequel from 2014. But that 1h long Short Animation didn\'t give me any insight to to story. Now that is some plot hole, don\'t you think? It is like half of the season is missing. But what is it now about?The story starts off, as I said, with our main characters of the Volunteer Army fighting the Dark King and loosing. As mentioned, some little fairy disappears and a very important book called the Chronicle is split into two. The Chronicle is said to hold the entire history of the world and if it were to be stained black, the whole world would too fall into darkness. One half is now in possession of the Dark King and after the battle ends in a big loss for the Volunteer Army, they were forced to retreat. Yet their hope did not disappear entirely and so they set off on another journey to find Pirika (the lost fairy) and gather more allies for their upcoming fight with the Dark King.Even though the anime has a really messed up story line, it still got a 8/10 from me in the MAL rating, and here\'s all why:1. The fantasy-magic setting of Chain Chronicle is one of the best I have ever seen. I know I have seen such setting in a lot anime, but this one special in some way. First of all the powers are based on both magic and mana-powered swordsmanship that just looks so amazing in the fight sequences. The world it self is extremely interesting seeing all the different regions from desserts to forests. I just hoped they had put more effort in the details of each of the seven regions and their rulers. The setting was fantastic and the anime was magical. I loved the fights and enjoyed every battle each of which was epic and thrilling at the same time.2. The cliche hero-friendship bond story was not boring and irritating as it happens to be in most other anime. The core and in some way the moral of the anime was that friendship bonds are stronger than any dark power that exists and that each hero, no matter how strong he is, cannot overcome evil all by him self. And despite the fact that every episode had at least one scene where they wanted to point that out it didn\'t annoy me. It was the way the anime conveyed the message that made it enjoyable and really emotional. Many fight scenes but also these \'emotional speeches about friendship and loyalty\' gave me enormous chills and I enjoyed every single second of it.3.The story is not centered about one character alone. I think that this is definitely the best thing about Chain Chronicles. Even though we know right from the start who the main characters are, the anime still manages to put every character in the spotlight for some time. And what\'s also good, you don\'t get an annoying over powered main protagonist with powers served on a silver plate. Through the anime you see the hardship and difficulties that each character is facing and overcoming so in the end you forget that the anime actually started from something you might call a highlight because you get the feeling that you\'ve been with the characters from the very beginning.To conclude the talk about the plot and story line, 24 episodes for this anime might have made it a real masterpiece but nevertheless it is extremely enjoying and entertaining just as it is. And now more about the characters:CHARACTERS  👦👩---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just as I mentioned before, all the characters in Chain Chronicles took part in the story. From the main characters Yuri, Phoena and Aram to some side(main) characters like princess Juliana, Burckhardt and other, each of them had its own side story and they were really good. Most of them were really emotional due to the bonds they shared for each other. The two main male protagonists Yuri and Aram both share a pure and kind personality and willpower. Where they differ? Well, Yuri is a down-to-earth and calm individual that tries to omit conflict at any cost. Aram, being just a boy has a really short temper and gets easily in trouble.When it comes to the female lead Phoena, I must say that I didn\'t like her in the beginning. I thought she would be just a useless side-kick like Sakura but she actually went through an amazing character development being the keeper of the Chronicle. My favorite character was definitely princess Juliana. She was such a lovely yet though and extremely capable leader that showed strength in moments when she was needed by both her friends and her people. Also one of the most amazing moments was when she fought...SPOILER..in the and.ANIMATION AND STYLE 💻---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I still have no idea what to talk about in this section. As every animation nowadays it is extremely good. Still the thing that not every anime has is detail. The backgrounds of Chain Chronicle are amazing and as mentioned before the fight scenes are incredible. As for the style, I gotta say that I loved the character design. I know it wasn\'t that special but it was also not ordinary. And one more thing that is definitely worth mentioning was the opening. The theme song ""My Liberation"" and the video were really catchy and the proof for that is the fact that I actually did not skip it in every episode.CONCLUSION 📌---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I really don\'t understand anime makers form time to time. Were you really that lazy to make additional 12 episodes? It would have made the anime so much better if it actually had a beginning and a proper introduction to the story. Still, awesome characters, a really interesting setting and amazing animation made the anime really enjoyable, entertaining and worth your time. And so I still didn\'t find my fantasy masterpiece, but until then I entertain my self it other good anime, and Chain Chronicles is definitely one of them. sacred book, the world is becoming dark, some fairy (that seems very important) suddenly disappears and you\'re just watching and thinking...wait what?

And so I still didn\'t find my fantasy masterpiece, but until then I entertain my self it other good anime, and Chain Chronicles is definitely one of them.', 'MY LIBERATIONWhat happens when a mobile game adaptation decides to fling you into the final boss battle and LOSE?Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari is an ambitiously ""decently"" well executed anime adaptation with great world building and characters of a mobile game but...Well let\'s start off with it\'s plot, aforementioned, the main cast of characters, that is the Volunteer Army helmed by Yuri voiced by Akira Ishida tries and failed to defeat the Black King, brushing their wounds and with Pirika the Navi- *ahem* Gacha func- *ahem* the Chronicle embodying the titular Chain Chronicle, disappears. It\'s not until Yuri befriends Aram voiced by Daiki Yamashita that...Yuri tries once again to reform the Volunteer Army and take on the Black King again.Now with the premise itself is an intriguing setting especially the consequences of the main protagonist Yuri and all the burden that weighs on him having failed his people and offset consequences, external and internal it leads him onto. LA will say it off the bat but Yuri is the best, most interesting character out of the entire cast as his entire deal is that is constant need to protect EVERYONE and the burden it brought onto him and when the plot gets very serious, like to the point of no return for Yuri with this entire dilemma it\'s all on Yuri where all the intrigue comes in...butOk, elephant in the room and biased opinion coming in. It concerns Aram, the friend Yuri befriends. Aram is an incredibly bratty and annoying character and having a sorta ""chosen one"" status about him he attracts almost ALL the good luck or is shown to be the ""most pure"" character out of the entire cast and THAT makes him out to be a gary stu, ohh sure he grows from his annoying bratty ways bu with how the anime just LOVES him got irritating very quick, if anything it feels like what happened in Final Fantasy XII, where Vaan tags along to the plot and the major plotline revolves more towards Ashe than Vaan. LA is NOT saying LA hated Aram or anything but when we have Yuri, a complex main protagonist, filled with backstory and development, heck he might as well be the hero of the anime in all regards and in comparison to Aram who\'s the main ""protagonist"", thankfully BOTH characters have the majority of the focus in the anime and by the end, well yeah much like Vaan from Final Fantasy XII, Aram got better as he didn\'t get top billing during the finale sticking him with the ""chosen one"" status which was what LA feared.As for the other characters, well in comes the world building and where there are fractured factions to the Volunteer Army, mainly Juliana voiced by Kotori Koiwai of the Holy Kingdom and Shuza voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa of the 9 Territories. The allegory in obvious once the both of them clash (aka. west vs. east) and their infighting doesn\'t help matters as that affects Yuri\'s plotline indirectly as a result due to well you know their major threat of the Black King being a thing. World building isn\'t just from Juliana and Shuza as we travel with Yuri and the Volunteer Army that we get to the magic system of this world and functions of the mobile game like ""chain attacks"" though clunky through it\'s animation is still implemented ""ok"" and though many of the exposition is spouted from the many many MANY minor characters, nonetheless the flavour text was much appreciated.Yes, if you haven\'t noticed, LA played the English version of the mobile game before it was shut down...Now some minor flaws LA wanted to make note of, besides Aram, is that and this is the most obvious one is that the cast is undoubtedly HUGE considering the many factions, villains and allies alike in this anime, now it IS a detriment that we don\'t know everyone\'s backstory but to this flaw\'s defense, Yuri\'s and Aram\'s along with Juliana, Shuza and Burckhardt\'s character developments were decent to the major focus of the entire anime and LA won\'t knock those plotliine down if LA doesn\'t know EVERY character in the anime and quite honestly that would bloat the entire anime and diverge the plot for no reason. Secondly is the major plot villain himself the Black King himself voiced by Akio Ootsuka, he\'s your typical ""the world must be destroyed in order to save it"" kinda deal, heck his minions are more interesting than he is to be honest. The ONLY interesting thing about the Black King however is that he\'s Phoena\'s father. Lastly would be the finale and though the finale has ALOT of great points about it, the only flaw that kept nagging LA is that fact \'friendship"" being the key reason and how the heroes bring themselves back up in defeating the lack King, LA knows it\'s cliched to all hell and back but considering the anime constantly and frequently slammed your head with this fact, LA can give this cliche some grace as it was a build up and theme of the anime anyways.Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari\'s greatest strength comes in making Yuri a believable and fleshed out character with his backstory, development and his latter dilemma\'s drowning him into the darkness, yes that\'s right the main protagonist and technically the ""player"" character is the most fleshed out character in the anime, something LA rarely gets to see.The animation done by Telecom Animation Film and Graphinica was actually done decently especially from Telecom Animation Film with it\'s character designs and backgrounding, though because of the Black King, the atmosphere is mostly on the dreary, ""purple-blackness"" side of things. CGI was a bit janky though used...""sparingly"" and LA says that loosely as they use their CGI in the more complex or quick movements of the characters attacks than anything but it\'s blatantly noticeable (though the CGI sometimes are integrated with the traditional animation at times, so it can\'t be even consistent) but nonetheless the CGI wasn\'t ""that"" bad. Overall the animation was decent, the CGi a bit iffy at times.As for the voice cast, well it was pretty decent all round and though LA did find Daiki Yamashita\'s cadence to be annoying as Aram well...actually LA has nothing else to add to that. Ayane Sakura, Akira Ishida and Kotori Koiwai were great as Phoena, Yuri and Juliana respectively if LA would have to note any voice actors that caught LA\'s ear and one of the smaller reasons why LA wanted to watch Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari was because of Nao Touyama and she\'s a songstress character, ahh so an archetypal role for her and she\'s in the supporting cast and sings a bit...yaaaaaaaa. No but seriously the voice cast was nonetheless great, if a bit annoying *cough* AramLike LA aforementioned, the ending is actually pretty great, it wraps up ALL the loose plotlines from every character that had a stake in the plot and thankfully Aram didn\'t get top billing and the theme of ""friendship"" comes in to make that happen (which LA is SOO glad it did). The ending was a climactic finish, slightly cliche sure but nonetheless the culmination of everything that occurred in the anime and was nicely concluded if a bit tongue in cheek in a nice way.Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari was an ambitious mobile game adaptation, thinking on it, not many mobile games ever have ""ends"", maybe Fate Grand Order in some sense with it\'s singularities, but for Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari to think and weave a plot about the downfall of your heroes and the fall and rise it leads into was fascinating, if only the gary stu main protagonist wouldn\'t have the spotlight to the actual hero of the anime it would had been a bit better, but nonetheless the finale helped make this statement much better at the end of it all. LA may bias towards Aram, the stereotypical major villain and the huge cast of characters who barely have nay development as well the jank CGI animation but Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari\'s main strength lies in it\'s characters and world building and that NEVER wavered throughout the anime. Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari was and is ambitious for it\'s genre of being a mobile game adaptation and LA by all means feel that it did have a story to tell and went all the way with it and was executed ""quite well"". Yuri tries once again to reform the Volunteer Army and take on the Black King again.Now with the premise itself is an intriguing setting especially the consequences of the main protagonist Yuri and all the burden that weighs on him having failed his people and offset consequences, external and internal it leads him onto. LA will say it off the bat but Yuri is the best, most interesting character out of the entire cast as his entire deal is that is constant need to protect EVERYONE and the burden it brought onto him and when the plot gets very serious, like to the point of no return for Yuri with this entire dilemma it\'s all on Yuri where all the intrigue comes in...butOk, elephant in the room and biased opinion coming in. It concerns Aram, the friend Yuri befriends. Aram is an incredibly bratty and annoying character and having a sorta ""chosen one"" status about him he attracts almost ALL the good luck or is shown to be the ""most pure"" character out of the entire cast and THAT makes him out to be a gary stu, ohh sure he grows from his annoying bratty ways bu with how the anime just LOVES him got irritating very quick, if anything it feels like what happened in Final Fantasy XII, where Vaan tags along to the plot and the major plotline revolves more towards Ashe than Vaan. LA is NOT saying LA hated Aram or anything but when we have Yuri, a complex main protagonist, filled with backstory and development, heck he might as well be the hero of the anime in all regards and in comparison to Aram who\'s the main ""protagonist"", thankfully BOTH characters have the majority of the focus in the anime and by the end, well yeah much like Vaan from Final Fantasy XII, Aram got better as he didn\'t get top billing during the finale sticking him with the ""chosen one"" status which was what LA feared.As for the other characters, well in comes the world building and where there are fractured factions to the Volunteer Army, mainly Juliana voiced by Kotori Koiwai of the Holy Kingdom and Shuza voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa of the 9 Territories. The allegory in obvious once the both of them clash (aka. west vs. east) and their infighting doesn\'t help matters as that affects Yuri\'s plotline indirectly as a result due to well you know their major threat of the Black King being a thing. World building isn\'t just from Juliana and Shuza as we travel with Yuri and the Volunteer Army that we get to the magic system of this world and functions of the mobile game like ""chain attacks"" though clunky through it\'s animation is still implemented ""ok"" and though many of the exposition is spouted from the many many MANY minor characters, nonetheless the flavour text was much appreciated.Yes, if you haven\'t noticed, LA played the English version of the mobile game before it was shut down...Now some minor flaws LA wanted to make note of, besides Aram, is that and this is the most obvious one is that the cast is undoubtedly HUGE considering the many factions, villains and allies alike in this anime, now it IS a detriment that we don\'t know everyone\'s backstory but to this flaw\'s defense, Yuri\'s and Aram\'s along with Juliana, Shuza and Burckhardt\'s character developments were decent to the major focus of the entire anime and LA won\'t knock those plotliine down if LA doesn\'t know EVERY character in the anime and quite honestly that would bloat the entire anime and diverge the plot for no reason. Secondly is the major plot villain himself the Black King himself voiced by Akio Ootsuka, he\'s your typical ""the world must be destroyed in order to save it"" kinda deal, heck his minions are more interesting than he is to be honest. The ONLY interesting thing about the Black King however is that he\'s Phoena\'s father.

It has nothing to do with other worlds or anything of the sort.  Instead, the series opens with Yuri, the main hero and leader of the coalition seeking to stop the Black King from destroying the world, being utterly defeated by said Black King.  Much of the first...half of the series chronicles Yuri\'s attempts to cope with the pressure that he never wanted placed on him, as well as his guilt at failing to stop the end of the world and his attempts to put his coalition back together for one last shot at taking down the Black King in the face of widespread hopelessness and pessimism among his allies.  It has significantly more depth and nuance than you would expect from what appears at first to just be yet another cookie cutter adaptation of a mobile RPG set in a fantasy world.The story is the highlight of the series, but there a few interesting characters as well.  Yuri is one of the most interesting heroes you\'ll see in a show like this.  You hear him spouting all the stock fantasy hero lines, but are also taken inside his head to understand his self-doubt and the fact that deep down, he very much resents being a hero.  The ogre general Shuza that pursues his own goals and only periodically allies with the hero\'s party when their interests align is another interesting one.  Unfortunately, series co-lead Aram is as generic a shounen character as you\'ll find.  He\'s every bratty kid with ""potential"" that has to learn to fight as part of a team that you\'ve ever seen.  I would have liked to see his character be more nuanced or unique.It\'s a shame that he ends up carrying much of the series\' second half, and it\'s far weaker than the first half, which is mostly carried by Yuri, as a result.There are a few other more minor criticisms that I would add as well.  For one, the cast is far too big for a 12 episode series.  It\'s obvious that many of them were shoehorned in just to get them in the anime and showcase the wide variety of characters you can pull from the game\'s gacha mechanics.  It\'s one of a relatively few instances where it really makes it blatant that it\'s a video game adaptation.  Another is the concept of ""chain attacks"", which are an obvious video game mechanic that\'s been forced in to highlight the mobile game\'s combat system.  Additionally, battle scenes are often animated with CGI, and while it\'s better integrated than most CGI you\'ll see, it still looks bad or like a low-quality video game cutscene at times.  Characters with long hair suffer the most, as the hair ends up looking like rigid plastic, like you could snap it off like the hair on a lego guy\'s head.  It also leans too heavily on generic shounen themes like ""trust in your friends"" and ""never give up"", it would have been nice if had something a bit more unique to say in that regard.Overall though, this is one of the best mobile RPG adaptations I\'ve seen, and if you can overlook the sometimes generic themes and other minor problems, it\'s an interesting little fantasy series where the hero and his party are true underdogs and have to genuinely grapple with the pessimism that comes from being hopelessly outmatched by the villain.  This is definitely a series that has more going on than meets the eye, so don\'t judge it by the CGI or the fact that it\'s a mobile game adaptation. half of the series chronicles Yuri\'s attempts to cope with the pressure that he never wanted placed on him, as well as his guilt at failing to stop the end of the world and his attempts to put his coalition back together for one last shot at taking down the Black King in the face of widespread hopelessness and pessimism among his allies.

An impressive and beautifully animated story.When I first looked up this anime I saw some seriously negative reviews and I was almost swayed by them. I am so glad that I didn't listen. This anime is such a gem. I think the characters and the plot are all quite unique and well thought out. There is also sufficient character development throughout the series for all the main characters. I mean generically you always have a plot where the Hero gathers their team to defeat the Demon king and you don't often see an anime...which looks at the consequences of the hero failing. Personally I think this anime was not only well written, but a very decent exploration into the adventure/fantasy genre.The animation, now Telecom Animation Film did a splendid job with this. All the characters all looked beautiful, you can tell the budget was big  on this one. Although I'm not very fond of the whole 3D animation theme, they used it sparingly and at beautiful moments. It transformed some of their action scenes into complete masterpieces.Which brings us on to the fight scenes. It's not often that I get so excited by fight scenes that I am practically rocking in my chair. Trust me I love me some fight scenes and If you want to see some serious fighting then I am telling you, you gotta watch this because their swordplay is not only beautiful but intense. All the various characters have their own styles, the Sakuga is great. Trust me it will keep you on your toes.The soundtrack was also impressive.

Beyond the tropes, this anime appears to rely heavily on the popularity of its source material (of which, I'm unfamiliar).  It's fanservice, nothing more.

Though the only upside to this is we do see a more comedic side to the Cinderella Girls because of it.In terms of animation by Studio Gathering (who also did Puchimas series), the animation for the majority is expected moe chibified format but with this art style allows the comedic moments to come in more easily, plus it's animation does change into full detail (again paying homage to the mobage cards) and those times, it's animation is pretty good for Studio Gathering.Cinderella Girls Gekijou is one of LA's somewhat guilty pleasure anime shorts for Spring 2017 with obvious reasons (being a fan of im@s series even extending to Cinderella Girls), but even for those just getting into the Cinderella Girls, this is a good place to start off with, bringing us characters that we didn't know (due to Cinderella Girls HUGE ensemble cast outside of MASTER idols) and showing us their daily lives with a hint of comedy to them.

The five minute episodes are split into three scenes, that are generally allotted to one or two characters at most. Scenes typically follow the 4-koma panel joke set up of setting, build up, punchline and tsukkomi.Plot is minimal and serves purely as fan-service, (not sexual), which is why it is hard to enjoy without being an iDOLM@STER fan. While the recent iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls anime features several girls in Gekijou's cast, there are also several cast members from the game series included.Art and sound are...minimalistic, ocassionally becoming more pronounced during close-up scenes or fan-service moments. On the other hand, ending themes are pleasing 30 second excerpts of their full version songs. Since series focuses on character fanservice, it is more enjoyable if you like iDOLM@STER's cast.

Not so with this series. Part of the problem is that the episodes are even shorter than usual, at about 2:30 once you take out the OP and ED, and they're then divided into three shorter segments! So you're looking at segments of under a minute each, which isn't much time to do anything. But even at that, the stories (such as they are)...just don't offer anything of value at all. No jokes, no nothing. Worse, they're apparently based on the game, rather than the anime, which does mean that we get to see some of the characters who didn't make it into the anime, but also means that rather than our buddy P-kun, we have these teenage girls trying to seduce the producer character, which is just gross.I will say the first episode isn't bad - it covers Miku bribing Anzu to work using candy, and Takumi (my girl!) crushing on Chieri - but the rest are pretty hopeless.

You are also introduced to a girl names Rhythm who seem to be the only human not in a cocoon but but has come from the digital world and has...something to do with argomon.it ends with an awsome battle, a kick-ass rock ending theme and a fairly funny blooper clip show during the credits. worth watching something to do with argomon.it ends with an awsome battle, a kick-ass rock ending theme and a fairly funny blooper clip show during the credits. worth watching', ""Like most other Digimon movies, this one starts out with no back story and just drops you into wherever the writers thought was a good place to start.The story wasn't original, actually, there wasn't much of a story at all, worlds in trouble by some super digimon, main characters have to defeat that digimon to save the world.......thats it, pretty much the same story from every other digimon movie and anime, so nothin new there.The art was good, its average quality but still pleasing to look at and the sound was ok as well, some of the voices annoyed me but it was good acting.The...characters are the exact same from the anime except for some girl digimon that cant really do anything.I didnt really like this anime mostly because it was to short and they probably could have done a much better job just by making it an hour or more, the fighting was rushed and unrealistic (well i cant spoil it, you'll just have to watch to see what i mean) and after it was over i didnt feel satisfied but somewhat dissapointed.I dont want to sound like i hated it but it could have been better if it was longer, i dont really have anything more to say but i hope someone likes it more than me :) characters are the exact same from the anime except for some girl digimon that cant really do anything.I didnt really like this anime mostly because it was to short and they probably could have done a much better job just by making it an hour or more, the fighting was rushed and unrealistic (well i cant spoil it, you'll just have to watch to see what i mean) and after it was over i didnt feel satisfied but somewhat dissapointed.I dont want to sound like i hated it but it could have been better if it was longer, i dont really have anything more to say but i hope someone likes it more than me :)"", 'Digimon films have a weird habit of being called films despite having double episode length. However, most of the still manage to have some sort of plot, cool action, interesting new characters or act simply as a reminder of how awesome the Digimon season was. This is where the Savers film probably surprises fans. Unlike the usual double episode we got single episode “film” and, even more surprisingly, less characters than in original season. Why the creators did that is completely beyond me.Story:Evil Digimon attacks and seals all humans. So the Digimon have to release them and defeat him. Sounds nice at first, right?...We can see Digimon used to get help from humans do something on their own. Of course, let’s not forget that one of the biggest charms of Digimon, evolution, is gone. So, we’re left with rookies fighting all Digimon. Still sounds nice since they’ll have to use some strategy. What if their strategy is run as fast and far as you can and leaving team members behind? Still looks interesting? In that case you’ll freaking love this film because that’s where the plot and characters end. Oh, there’s also tons of cliché and meaningful talks all around. Just go along with it if you want to enjoy it. This is about as pointless and cliché 20 minutes full of plot devices as can be.Art:Savers art. Nothing else. They didn’t even try to do something spectacular or different.Sound:Totally memorable stuff. Just don’t ask me to name something. I don’t even remember the opening or ending. If there were any.Character:Just our four main Digimon and a mysterious girl. If you really want some mystery in this, don’t think. Because the second you do, all mystery will be lost. The mysterious girl plays a very important role in this film. She’s the most colourful thing in the world, so they have to preserve her to fly her into the sun. No, not really, she’s just a colourful bush to drag along, I just needed to write something here. There’s really nothing else.Enjoyment:If this category was called “boredom” I would rate it 11/10. Throughout the whole thing, I was wondering why the hell they did this. Was it to punish fans and laugh at them? Was it to milk? Was it to show off character design that was scrapped (she really doesn’t serve any other purpose)? I really have no idea. This has no story to tell, no deep meaning, no character development, the interesting setting is completely butchered and if you think about it, you’ll know the end before it even starts.Overall: 4/10I’m very biased about rating Digimon. Being longtime fan, it doesn’t matter how bad they are, I can’t rate them lower than 4 since that’s the line of my “hate” rating. So, it leaves with “overrating” because if this were any other universe than Digimon, it wouldn’t get higher than 3 on my scale.

DearS,https://myanimelist.net/anime/63/DearS,"[""DearS is a combination of a failed Chobits clone (lacking any of the warmth that made that series so endearing) and, depending on your gender, offensive pro-slave rubbish. It's also uneventful, lacking a story and instead containing the same perverted nonsense you've seen before already until the episode count reaches 12-13.To start with, the premise is beyond dumb. A UFO crashes into Japan, 150 aliens - who happen to be submissive hotties - emerge, and they're welcomed by the world. Because humans are, as we all know, kind and understanding creatures by nature, no attempts were made to capture and experiment on the aliens. It's...the sort of plot element that would only work in a hentai. Or Melody of Oblivion....Oh, yes, hentai material. Have I covered the part where DearS all wear dog collars and are happy to be slaves, doing whatever their master wants, including sex? It's like sitting through the wet dream of a pre-pubescent retard. I'm sure most female viewers would find it slightly offensive to see females wearing dog collars and being happy to get in the kitchen when told - a great fan pleasing idea.As for the characters, Ren (the Chi of DearS) is blank, having zero personality. She also looks bad because of the crappy art - not at all fap worthy. And Takeya, the lucky lead, is a complete arsehole, never being a man and always being a complete fuck to Ren. He even tells her to go home and cook his food, also ordering her to clean his room. He lacks any likability. The only character with any depth whatsoever in this mess is the pink-haired DearS, whose name I've already forgot.On the plus side, DearS is easy to watch. It's so simple and stupid that it's possible to watch it for four hours, miss lines of dialogue and still understand what's going on. If you happen to be brain-dead or are looking for something that's easy to watch, despite being dull, DearS is for you. I only managed to sit through it all because I wasn't required to use my brain and could just chill.Alongside Melody of Oblivion, DearS has made for a great start to going through my DVD backlog. I can't wait to have a look at Petite Princess Yucie and A Little Snow Fairy Sugar. By the end of watching all the wonderful series I've collected on DVD, my mental state might reach the stage where life will seem too painful...Overall, I suggest avoiding DearS unless A) your dream woman wears a dog collar and stays in the kitchen or B) you're an idiot who paid money for the series because it's an OOP Geneon title.

Some of the fanservicey stuff in this is SO over-the-top it\'s past the point of annoying and more towards the point of amusing, because I don\'t think they took themselves completely seriously.So, who should watch this? If you want a relatively light-hearted plot with some situational comedy, sort of your typical high school thing and a fair bit of cuteness and a mild bit of seriousness, this isn\'t a bad choice. If you\'re up for...something with lots of depth, void of the typical animé tropes, you probably won\'t like it.The one thing that irritated me a little is that it ended a little abruptly. Something a lot of animé tends to do, though.Overall, it\'s worth trying if you\'re looking for something light and don\'t have a lot of time to invest, since it\'s a relatively short series at only 12 episodes. I find it\'s good to watch something silly and cute like this especially if you\'re watching some other heavier stuff.

(Aristotle says: ""Balance is good!"")', 'DearS is proof, that reading reviews before jumping into a series is a good habit to have. DearS is pretty much generally regarded as ""that awful Chobits ripoff"" so I went into it with pretty low expectations. I wasn\'t disappointed.So, a space ship crash-lands just off the coast of Japan, with 150 humanoid aliens on board. Oh, and they all look like super hot high-schoolers with supernatural abilities and a weirdly submissive nature. (Yep, this means EXACTLY what you think.) The ship is FUBAR, so they are stuck on Earth, but that\'s no problem, since the humans welcome them with open arms, naturally. I mean,...smoking hot aliens with inexplicable intelligence and magical powers (and a history of abuse and slavery...oops, spoilers) cannot possibly be dangerous, right? RIGHT?Anyway, the story opens with our protagonist, Ikuhara Takeya, an exceptionally generic high-school student with the intellect and personality of a brick. One transport accident later he finds one of the female DearS, naked (of course), utterly oblivious of everything, who immediately makes out with him....and then Chobits happens. That\'s the best I can describe the series. Ren, our titular alien super-bimbo, is a blatant ripoff of Chi, down to the same hair style, and Takeya is just a more stupid and arrogant version of Hideki. There is one thing being an endearingly clueless farmboy, but Takeya takes the ""oblivious asshole"" trope to a new level of annoying...Eh, on second thought, it\'s pretty pointless to describe the story and the characters. DearS is basically a dumbed down version of Chobits with it\'s heart ripped out and replaced with incredibly generic archetypes and a giant plothole for a story. What the series does have, is a disgusting amount of almost-hentai ecchi fanservice, that drowns everything else out. If the series had any endearing qualities or profound meaning, it\'s been lost somewhere between the nymphomaniac homeroom teacher who makes their students read porn out loud, and the magical sex-slaves from space. But even the ecchi is so corny and low-brow, that it\'s way more tiresome than fun.In the last few episodes the series does try to cobble together a sequel bait by dropping some character development and semi-coherent story bits, but it\'s too little, too late.  There was much potential in the setting, and with some rework it could\'ve been turned into something interesting, but sadly, it\'s was not to be. The art style didn\'t age well either and the sound/music is just forgettable background noise.There is literally nothing remarkable about DearS. It\'s just some mediocre ecchi fap-fuel with busty alien slave girls and bad slapstick comedy. There are some fun moments and interesting bits throughout the series, and it\'s only 13 episodes long, so if you can look past all it\'s faults, DearS could be a good choice for a boring afternoon, if you have nothing else to watch, but that\'s about it.

He is one of the few having no interest in a space ship that had crashed over a year ago. With Female passengers called DearS. One day he happens upon a naked shivering girl. At first he thought she was just a girl, but then realized she was actually one of the aliens from the ship crash. He takes her home reluctantly. He'd seen one too many sci-fi movies and constantly feared she was going to brain wash him. The next day, he sets her in a closet to hide while he went to school and she...chose that as her room. Takeya does his best to help the girl called Ren. Who unlike other DearS can't speak much at first. It turns out that she is in actually malfunctioning and is being hunted down by their leader. Takeya eventually begins to learn more about DearS, and a mythical DearS relationship called “Gift” that starts to develop between them.Story & Characters (7/10)DearS is one of the bishoujo shows from the summer 2004 anime season, which ran for 12 episodes. Based on a popular manga by Peach-Pit, the story revolves around slacker student Takeya Ikuhara and a race of aliens known as DearS. The DearS crash-landed on Earth and were unable to return to their home planet, so an arrangement was worked out to allow homestays, which would let the DearS learn about Earthling culture and life. Takeya is indifferent to the DearS, while everyone around him gets excited at the news that their school would get a DearS student. While walking home one day, he sees a mysterious (and naked) DearS, who promptly kisses him. He names her Ren, and she takes to calling him her master. This is only the beginning of their story…With DearS, you get a show that incorporates a lot of things seen in other shows of this genre. Busty bishoujo? Yep. “Goshujin-sama” complex? Got that. Fanservice? A good amount. Light comedy to balance out the serious parts? Mmm hmm. Reluctant male lead warming up to adoring female? Yep. An imminent separation for the star-crossed lovers? Got that too.The story progresses briskly through the 12 episodes, with a minimal amount of filler involving Takeya’s annoying sister. Largely a slice-of-life show, DearS manages to be entertaining in spite of the thin backstory and underdeveloped characters. You also have characters like the horny Mitsuka-sensei popping in from time to time for big yucks, and Neneko acting as the voice of reason. Miu, another DearS, acts as a sort of guardian and rival to Ren, but unfortunately those angles were only given passing consideration.Art (8/10)[Technical aspects of this score based on R2 DVDs]The art is well-done and the characters stay on-model for the most part during the show. The character designs stay true for the most part to the ones in the manga. It’s a shame that the animation isn’t as smooth as that of a higher-budgeted show, like Hagaren or Chrno Crusade. There’s plenty of scenes where nothing moves for a while, but at least the art looks good despite the lack of motion. I think they blew the budget on the scenes of Mitsuka-sensei groping herself, which were animated really well! The DVDs do have some added detail in the linework and extra frames of animation not present in the broadcast version, always a plus. Also of note is the subdued color palette, which leads to a nice visual presentation with the DearS standing out the most.Sound (7/10)[Technical aspects of this score based on R2 DVDs]The sound is a solid PCM stereo mix, with good directionality and clarity. The cast has a lot of familiar voices, with Kishyo Taniyama (Seiji in Midori no Hibi, Takayuki in Kimi ga Nozomu Eien) voicing Takeya, Ai Shimizu (Minawa in Mahoromatic, Karen in Onegai Twins) as Ren, Mai Nakahara (Anna in Godannar, Midori in Midori no Hibi) playing Miu, and the legendary Kikuko Inoue (Belldandy in Ah! Megami-sama, Mizuho in Please Teacher) as Mitsuka. All the seiyuu turn in good performances, especially Inoue-san, whose work as Mitsuka provides a lot of the comic relief.The background music is serviceable but unmemorable, with a good amount of repetition throughout the show. The opening song by Under17 is catchy but can get annoying after repeated listens. The end song, Happy Cosmos, is performed by the new group PoppinS, made up of Mai Nakahara and Ai Shimizu. If you get a chance to check out the music video, it’s strange and quirky!Overall (7/10)I enjoyed DearS throughout its short run, but when it was over nothing really stuck with me. Much like other shows that end before the manga (Mahoromatic, Hellsing), the show’s producers are left to come up with an ending that ends up being either forced or rushed. Things are left open for a second season, and there’s plenty of material still unanimated.Although not particularly original, DearS was entertaining every week I sat down to catch an episode. Some things like Mitsuka-sensei’s antics worked well, and others like Takeya’s bratty sister didn’t. If you liked DearS, then have a look at Chobits, which has some similarities but has the benefit of 26 episodes to develop its characters as well as better original source material by manga goddesses CLAMP, leading to a more enjoyable experience.I’d ultimately classify DearS as a guilty pleasure, with nice bishoujo action, fanservice, nice (if contrived) romance, a decent backstory, and mostly appealing characters. DearS isn’t an essential recommendation, but have a look if you’ve got some spare time. There’s worse ways to spend it than by watching an episode or two. chose that as her room. Takeya does his best to help the girl called Ren. Who unlike other DearS can't speak much at first. It turns out that she is in actually malfunctioning and is being hunted down by their leader. Takeya eventually begins to learn more about DearS, and a mythical DearS relationship called “Gift” that starts to develop between them.Story & Characters (7/10)DearS is one of the bishoujo shows from the summer 2004 anime season, which ran for 12 episodes. Based on a popular manga by Peach-Pit, the story revolves around slacker student Takeya Ikuhara and a race of aliens known as DearS. The DearS crash-landed on Earth and were unable to return to their home planet, so an arrangement was worked out to allow homestays, which would let the DearS learn about Earthling culture and life. Takeya is indifferent to the DearS, while everyone around him gets excited at the news that their school would get a DearS student. While walking home one day, he sees a mysterious (and naked) DearS, who promptly kisses him. He names her Ren, and she takes to calling him her master. This is only the beginning of their story…With DearS, you get a show that incorporates a lot of things seen in other shows of this genre. Busty bishoujo? Yep. “Goshujin-sama” complex? Got that. Fanservice? A good amount. Light comedy to balance out the serious parts? Mmm hmm. Reluctant male lead warming up to adoring female? Yep. An imminent separation for the star-crossed lovers? Got that too.The story progresses briskly through the 12 episodes, with a minimal amount of filler involving Takeya’s annoying sister. Largely a slice-of-life show, DearS manages to be entertaining in spite of the thin backstory and underdeveloped characters. You also have characters like the horny Mitsuka-sensei popping in from time to time for big yucks, and Neneko acting as the voice of reason. Miu, another DearS, acts as a sort of guardian and rival to Ren, but unfortunately those angles were only given passing consideration.Art (8/10)[Technical aspects of this score based on R2 DVDs]The art is well-done and the characters stay on-model for the most part during the show. The character designs stay true for the most part to the ones in the manga. It’s a shame that the animation isn’t as smooth as that of a higher-budgeted show, like Hagaren or Chrno Crusade. There’s plenty of scenes where nothing moves for a while, but at least the art looks good despite the lack of motion. I think they blew the budget on the scenes of Mitsuka-sensei groping herself, which were animated really well! The DVDs do have some added detail in the linework and extra frames of animation not present in the broadcast version, always a plus. Also of note is the subdued color palette, which leads to a nice visual presentation with the DearS standing out the most.Sound (7/10)[Technical aspects of this score based on R2 DVDs]The sound is a solid PCM stereo mix, with good directionality and clarity.

It has been viewed by many as a Chobits rip off. While Chobits had some areas that saved it from the trash bin, this title has none.

The animation is very good, with the same Happy Lesson tendency for the male lead character to have over-exaggerated facial expressions.Aside from the extreme Chobitsiness, this on the first episode of DearS it was very well done.

The animation...while inconsistent and sometimes just downright sloppy, it actually pretty close to the manga\'s art style (which makes the inconsistency even more surprising, considering it was made by Peach-pit.) The music was so-so, it wasn\'t anything special, but it set the tone appropriately as needed. The humor, although kind of cliche\'d was really funny in parts, but a lot of it was too similar to the chobits series with a few ""takeya\'s afraid of aliens, hehe"" type jokes thrown in occasionally...I could over look these things...if it weren\'t for the Worst parts...They took the majority of the unique plot out of the anime and actually ended the manga around the end of the 5th volume of the manga, which removed the entire last arc of the story, which had some of the most unique and interesting parts of the manga, the explaination of ""the gift"" and the strange, but funny ending. They also removed one of the most important characters from the story altogether. They also took out any scenes that give any sort of depth to Ren\'s character whatsoever.Anyways, in closing, if you have any kind of interest in this at all, read the manga, the anime isn\'t really worth the time unless you haven\'t read the manga and just want a shallow laugh and a cliche\'d romance that\'s about as deep as a puddle. The manga offers much more in terms of character and story, but the art style in the manga is a little inconsistent, but still better than the constant inconsistency of the anime. one of the few anime that i actually prefer dubbed, the dub is good...most of the time, there are some lines that are really monotone when they needed more emphasis (Usually on Takeya and Nenekos parts) , but over all, it wasn\'t bad.

I would have given it a 10 if it wasn\'t for the unbelievably annoying main character - Takeya. But more of that later, first the story.Yes, so DearS starts out in a pretty weird way. A humongous alien spaceship (probably the size of titanic) lands on the shores of Japan. However war doesn\'t break out, mad scientists don\'t attempt to capture said aliens and famous american 3-leter agencies (FBI, CIA etc) are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the aliens turn out to be young hot women and the entire world welcomes them...with open arms. Before you know it the aliens are called ""dears"" and make friends with the humans.Then it gets slightly weirder. One of the aliens is being transported through a town in some kind of a container. The containers slips from the transport and breaks, setting the alien free. The alien in question is an another hottie (Ren Ren blah blah blah... whatever her name is) dears. So it just happens that this hottie runs into -quite possibly- the most annoying main character ever to appear in anime. The deliquents name is Ikuhara Takeya. He\'s a cocky, arrogant and absolutely irritating chauvinist, constantly complaining about even the most trivial things. He\'s a total pain in the ass. When he first comes across our Ren, he\'s ready to just leave her there half naked. It\'s only when a truck nearly runs her over that he saves her and decides to help her out... sort of.The rest of the series primarly revolves around Takeya and Ren and their hilarious antics. Like Ren walking in on Takeya when he\'s in the bathroom or wriggling in her sleep and ending up sitting on his face (ahah yes that way). It is simply hilarious. There\'s actually a pretty good reason for all that but if I told you it would spoil the story.Now then sound and art. While there is nothing much to say about sound, the art style is impressive. Apart from the fact that some characters have so much hair that if stretched out they would probably reach the moon, this anime pays a lot of attention to every single detail. In others words, it\'s high quality. Congrats to the studio for doing a job well done.All in all, a very enjoyable anime, if you can withstand the male lead\'s constant rants&complaints and irritable nature.9/10 with open arms.

I figured DearS would be a little cheesy, but wanted to give it a chance since the character designs were so cute. It was good to have low standards from the beginning.The story is a little bit recycled, but nothing criminal. You have a beautiful girl with no memories that gets put into the care of an uninterested male lead (i.e. Chobits) and you watch a handful of slice-of-life-esq episodes with plenty of fanservice before finding out the ulterior plot.The art in this series had so much potential....The manga's art style is painfully cute, and I just love the character designs. Unfortunately, it has some of the cheapest animation I've ever seen. They re-use scenes and animation, everything looks rushed and sloppy, people's faces are sideways, it's cringe-worthy.

(Well, no matter how bad or boring an anime might be, I will watch it entirely... well that\'s my policy).If I remember, it was after watching ""Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?"" that I started watching DearS because I was totally in a Harem mood but it was such a let-down that I had to encourage myself to watch each episode. The reason why I didn\'t enjoy DearS are as follows:Art:I’m perfectly aware that the...anime is pretty old but if I were to compare it with older anime such as “Maison Ikkoku” or “Sailor Moon” which are even older there is a huge difference. The art for DearS is undeniably the worst one compared to these two. The bodies of both male and female characters in the anime are disproportionate. The female characters could have been cuter or simply beautiful if more efforts would have been poured while making the anime but unfortunately.Character:The male protagonist was one of the reasons why I was about to make DearS the first anime to get in my drop list. Sometimes I like Harem where the guy is weak but still tries his best to get stronger and take care for his chicks (e.g Aikawa Ayumu from Kore was Zombie Desu ka) and sometimes I like these Harem where the guy is strong and is dominant (straight forward that is e.g Issei Hyoudo from High School DxD) but in the case of DearS the male protagonist is none. He is just an indecisive guy who and stays as such as the series progresses with no character development at all… He is totally lame and has absolutely nothing that would make you want to root for him.As the series progresses, there are other side characters who are introduced for no apparent reasons. They seems to be just there just to make some episodes reach the target of 19 minutes and they really get on your nerves.Story/Plot:The story seems to be just a raw idea that was badly exploited. A Harem featuring an alien female ready to do whatever her earthling master desires had so much potential to be funny and even enjoyable but you don’t get to see all of these in DearS. In fact, you don’t get to see anything of what you’d expect from a Harem anime in DearS. There are no cute moments and the awkward moments are not really so awkward at all. Moreover there are a lot of episodes where a lot of things that were mentioned were left unexplained… somehow things feels too rushed and you really understand what\'s happening.Conclusion:I’m not saying that DearS is the worst anime ever but it is certainly not an enjoyable one and Harem Lovers especially will feel disappointed. But still you could still give DearS a try but without getting hyped up and not setting your expectations too high.Peace out... anime is pretty old but if I were to compare it with older anime such as “Maison Ikkoku” or “Sailor Moon” which are even older there is a huge difference.

Moreover there are a lot of episodes where a lot of things that were mentioned were left unexplained… somehow things feels too rushed and you really understand what\'s happening.Conclusion:I’m not saying that DearS is the worst anime ever but it is certainly not an enjoyable one and Harem Lovers especially will feel disappointed. But still you could still give DearS a try but without getting hyped up and not setting your expectations too high.Peace out...', ""This is my first review here guys but I hope many of you will still find it helpful!DearS is an anime very alike Chobits! There are some differences between the 2 but you will be able to find lots of similarities. I still enjoyed this series a lot and I feel like this is a really nice anime to watch if you really don't know what to watch or your just looking for something really lighthearted.Story: (8)DearS begins with a group of aliens called the DearS whom crash on to earth and are forced to stay. The DearS have a goal in which they...must find a master and must fulfill all of the masters wishes. Okay, so I personally don't like the idea of being slaves in which all of the DearS believe they should be but throughout the series many of the characters try and get them to start thinking on their own more so that they can find out who they are for themselves.Art (8)The animation for this anime sure may look a bit old but there is just so much detail put into the character designs overall. I myself personally found myself pausing at some scenes just to look at how detailed their designs were!Sound (9)Most of the soundtracks within the anime itself didn't really stand out to me except a couple but I will say that the opening is really nice. I think It is a really relaxing song and you won't be able to find much tracks out there with the same kind of atmosphere going on. The ending theme was also energetic and fun to listen too. There were some sound effects within the series that were nice to listen to and I think the voice actors fit in pretty nicely!Character (9)I thought a lot of the characters were really fun to watch! Watching Ren crave over Melon bread was epecially cute! Ikuhara might seem like a cold character but deep down he has a sweet side that cares for what's going on. A lot of the characters were very energetic so that was also really fun to watch! Over all I think the characters were entertaining and I think a lot of them had really nice designs!Enjoyment (9)I gave the enjoyment to the series an 8 because there wasn't really a moment where I was really bored that I wanted to stop any of the episodes but I did take some breaks now and then to do some other stuff.Overall (9)Overall I give the series a 9. I think some of the messages that weren't very visible to many were pretty nice and overall I feel like watching this series took my mind of of lots of things and it was just a pretty nice series to watch. This reminded me a lot about Chobits which I really liked as well. must find a master and must fulfill all of the masters wishes.

Although this has a questionable plot, which was made specifically made for ecchi, it's pretty good. Basically, the story has a somewhat cliche line (by ecchi standards). There's the boy who lives by himself, then happens to stumble upon a beautiful girl who then moves in with him. From there I think you guys know where this is going.Over all i give this series a 8/10, a little predictable, with a cliff hanger ending. But if you liked Chobits, you'll like this anime. Some good humor, without pushing the ecchiness. "", 'You know when you\'re making a puzzle, and then when the picture begins to make sense ... you realize the box is missing a few pieces?Well... let\'s say this ""puzzle"" has 1000 pieces, but you\'re only given like 300.That was the feeling this particular series gave me when i finished watching it.Story: 5I give it such a low score, not because it\'s bad, I mean, the parent story seems awesome, but this adaptation, is just plain incomplete - it stopped in the 2nd or 3rd volume of an 8 volume manga so.... -  and filled with tons of fan service.It starts really promisingly.Aliens...(DearS) come from space, and turn out not only to be amicable (and skilled in languages) , but to be in the most part cute humanoid girls, with weird collars, and some huge hairdos. Takeya (main guy) finds one(Ren) in the street, and they.... connect.I can see why people may compare it with chobits somehow... but at the same time is completely different.You can really tell it stops randomly and the last episode is just some weird sort of cheesy wrapping ""happy ending"" that\'s made just so it doesn\'t end in complete suspense.You get a lot of questions during the whole season, but virtually no answers (I\'m even reading the manga to find out what actually happens)Art and Sound: 7The art is actually quite cute, nothing to complain there. the characters are cute and is all nicely animated (love the way they made the chibis :P )Ditto to the soundtrack, not too great, nor too awful.Character: 5Even though I love all the main Characters in a different way - Miu is really fun with all the mood swings and unnecessary drama, and Neneko and her dark humour get me all the time - The story\'s problem maintains, and theres no character evolution at all.I mean, apart from Ren getting better at household chores and stuff, you really get the feeling you don\'t get to know all there is to know about everyone, like for example, takeya\'s family and the weird relationship between them.again, it\'s not that they\'re bad characters, just undeveloped.Overall: 6If you want an anime with not much of a story per se, cute characters, and tons of boobs, you\'ll find it here, but if you\'re a teentsy bit like me, you\'ll get the feeling this is just lacking too much in the story department to make it more enjoyable, and you\'ll eventually drop it, or read the manga for curiosity\'s sake.

So excluding the ending this series served the great purpose of a light-hearted anime with roots. ', ""While I know probably no one will read this, I had to rewrite my review for this show.I love this show, both out of pure enjoyment, but also on a nostalgic level.I have read the manga, and also seen Chobits and Heaven's Lost Property.People liken this show to Chobits, which I both agree and disagree with. (Not giving spoilers) In the author's notes of the final volume of the manga, the author more or less addresses the similarities. She explained that it was their first major project, and their editor/publisher/can't remember which wanted them to play it safe at first. But after a...certain point, they got free reign, which both the manga, and the show steers far away from Chobits.For starters, pretty much all the character's are more fleshed out, incredibly likeable, and funny. Character's actually develop, and the humor has a distinct charm to it that was definitely ahead of its time. The townsfolk side characters they have for the anime (and sadly not the manga) makes the world feel alive.While yeah, the show definitely has fan service, I never particularly considered this a fan service show.Is this a Chobits clone? Absolutely not. Heaven's Lost Property, which I literally just watched for the first time very recently, definitely took elements from both DearS and Chobits, Ikaros is virtually identical to Ren personality wise (DearS was 2004-05, HLP was 2009).Should you watch this?

Every episode I just found myself hoping this dude's tentacles would fall off. The characters as a whole are also very dry. That artwork is very bad. The music is nothing special. There are hundreds of other series you should experience before crawling down here into DearS.

All these aspects are so often overlooked when people talk about this anime. DearS cleverly handles these topics and provides the watcher ethical dilemmas to think about without smashing the viewer with tons of dialogues to make it f**king obvious like in Ghost in The Shell.This also brings me to one segment of anime watchers I hate. The kind who claim to enjoy and understand ""intellectual"" type of anime and bash anything with even a little portion of fanservice. The truth is, every now and then, some...pretty mediocre anime with fanservice surfaces that actually has some deeper plot bellow its seemingly flat surface. From the way how the classroom teacher ""exposes"" her self, to the traditional lifestyle of some elderly people featured in the anime, the creators clearly wanted to create a deconstruct a woman\'s role in the family and society adding the perspective of outsiders who are not bounded by constraints we have put on ourselves.About being a Chobits clone, I don\'t have much to say against that. The main protagonist is put before similar ethical problems. Also the characters and their development is really similar to Chobits. What is totally different is the actual clash of ideals for the protagonists. In the case of Chobits its more like a inner fight, with the case of DearS the protagonist has to consider the the widely accepted ethics (left aside that the protagonist an asshole and doesn\'t care for the most of the time). Even after watching Chobits you can still find a lot of interesting aspects of handling similar problems and after seeing them both it will give you a better understanding of both of the series.I didn\'t have high expectations for this anime because its reviews, but after watching it, I have absolutely no regrets, so I give it a solid score of 6. pretty mediocre anime with fanservice surfaces that actually has some deeper plot bellow its seemingly flat surface.

After viewing the series in its entirety, I do feel it has problems, but for the most part I found the show enjoyable.Story (7):The story begins with a spaceship full of aliens called DearS crashing on earth. The humans accept these aliens and they are allowed citizenship in Japan. It seems that most of society is obsessed with the DearS, offering them special privileges, and pretty much fawning over them.One DearS in particular who is considered malfunctioned is accidentally released. This DearS who accepts the name...Ren meets a high school boy Takeya, who hates aliens, including the DearS. However, seeing that she is alone and in poor shape, Takeya takes her to recover at his house. Ren accepts Takeya as her master, a fact that he is not willing to accept. Nonetheless, Ren tries her hardest to make Takeya happy, many times fueling his anger and annoyance at her failures and misunderstandings.I think the story is pretty original. While it may come off as over the top in some cases, I think it adds to the overall story. I like the interactions between the characters.I like the majority of the humor in this anime. It\'s funny to see how hard Ren tries to please Takeya, only for her to continually mess up. Also the scenes of rivalry between Ren and Miu (a more dedicated DearS) is fun to watch. While on the subject of humor, there are random scenes with two middle-aged women haggling with a fish salesman, that has no relevance to the plot, but the exchanges provide some of the best comedy.There are a few cons with this anime. For one, it doesn\'t seem to fit into a specific genre. From what I viewed it can be classified as the following: science fiction, harem, romance, drama, school, ecchi, comedy, and magical. I also feel that the ecchi elements are overdone and unnecessary to the point that it distracts from the story.Another con is the fact that literally everyone, aside from Takeya, is obsessed with the DearS. I can understand being intrigued by actual aliens, but the level of obsession comes across as unrealistic and overdone.Also there is some confusion on the DearS\' laws. I won\'t go into detail about this, but some of the rules, especially concerning their purpose for existence, seems to contradict itself.Characters (5):The characters are a hit or miss for me. There are some that I absolutely adore, and others that irritate me everytime they appear on screen.To begin with, the main character Takeya is a typical high school student. He lives on his own, requiring him to work a part-time job after school. He is portrayed as rude and abrasive. I like this character. This is a character I haven\'t seen very often in anime, so I applaud DearS for having someone with this type of personality as a protagonist. Takeya stands out from many other harem anime leads.I find the secondary character, Ren, to be likable. Due to her not having a formal DearS education, there is a lot that she does not understand. In fact, Ren actually says, ""Ren does not understand,"" or a variation of that phrase countless times in the anime. Despite her ignorance, Ren is shown to be trying her hardest in every task assigned to her, making for a few comical moments. Even with her failures, she can still win the audience\'s hearts.I like how Takeya and Ren grow together. While at first Takeya hates the thought of looking after Ren, it is cute to watch their relationship grow. It\'s clear that Takeya does try to protect Ren, and encourages her to think for herself.Takeya\'s friend Neneko is a supporting character who helps Takeya out with his unfortunate problem. She serves as a helpful companion for Takeya, strong where he is lacking. I think it would have been difficult for Takeya to get through the beginning of his relationship with Ren had it not been for Neneko\'s assistance.The other main DearS character, Miu, serves as a foil for Ren. Unlike Ren, she has been well taught, and is proud of her accomplishments. It angers her greatly to see how much Ren lacks, and how she is allowed to get away with her unorthodox behavior. At first it may seem that Miu is being unnecessarily mean to Ren, but in episode eight, the audience gets a glimpse at her backstory, which explains why she strongly believes good intentions are not enough. Of all the characters, I find Miu to be the one who develops the most throughout the story. Some of my favorite scenes are the endearing interactions between Miu and her host family.As mentioned earlier, the nameless side characters add to the comedy and ambiance of the show.However, there are three characters in particular that I found annoying.The first is the catlike DearS Nia. I\'m sure she is supposed to be cute, and maybe in the original audio she is (I watched the dubbed version), but I found her to be a nuisance. For one, she\'s all over the place, always forgetting about her mission. I can\'t take her seriously, which makes me unable to take all of the DearS community leaders seriously. Secondly, the constant repetition of ""Nia, nia, nia"" during her dialogue gets old quick. It\'s not cute, just annoying. Again, I\'m not sure if this exists in the original audio, but I cringed everytime she spoke in the English dub.As annoying as Nia may be, she is a mere speck compared to Takeya\'s little sister, Natsuki. I was ready for her to leave the instant she was introduced. Whereas Nia serves a purpose to the plot, Natsuki is completely irrelevant to the story. If she was omitted from what little screen time she gets, nothing about the plot would change. She is rude to Ren, violent towards Takeya, and won\'t allow anyone to get a word in before jumping to conclusions. In short, she is frustrating to watch.Then of course there is Takeya\'s teacher. I think she is meant for comic relief, however I feel uncomfortable watching any scene including her. Sadly, she had the potential to be funny, but she is so exaggerated that it ruins the ""humor"" for me.Art (6):The character designs are interesting. I like how there is a distinct difference between the humans and the aliens. The humans have a more neutral color scheme whereas the DearS are full of color. The aliens have the unnatural hair colors anime is famous for, they have the colorful cultural costumes. Their eyes are larger and on the whole are designed to be more beautiful than the human characters. Even the male DearS such as Khi and Xaki stand out from the earthlings.On the same note, I think it\'s an interesting choice that the protagonist is designed to look plain, even among the other humans. The other male characters in his class have more interesting designs (and personalities). I guess this choice was made so that by having him not stand out, he ironically does. Also, perhaps it was to give more attention to the aliens by comparison. It could also represent that he is the only person who is not enchanted by the DearS. Whatever the reason, I found it to be an effective decision.I also found the animation to be pretty.Sound (4):I watched the English dub of this anime, so I can\'t say much on the original audio. I found the dub acting to be decent. Aside from Nia\'s dialogue, I have no complaints with the voice acting.I found the opening song to be boring (both the tempo and the singing). The ending song is more upbeat, but nothing too impressive.Conclusion (6):In conclusion, I find the story of DearS to be enjoyable and original. The character designs are pretty.I also like the wide variety of character personalities. The fact that the main character, the one person who is indifferent to the DearS, is the one who is paired with one makes for an amusing plot.I like the humor based on the misunderstandings, as well as the minor characters who get a fair amount of screen time.However, the overuse of ecchi in addition to a few annoying characters, and confusing concepts detract from anime.I\'m glad I viewed DearS, but I probably won\'t watch it a second time.6/10. Ren meets a high school boy Takeya, who hates aliens, including the DearS. However, seeing that she is alone and in poor shape, Takeya takes her to recover at his house. Ren accepts Takeya as her master, a fact that he is not willing to accept. Nonetheless, Ren tries her hardest to make Takeya happy, many times fueling his anger and annoyance at her failures and misunderstandings.I think the story is pretty original. While it may come off as over the top in some cases, I think it adds to the overall story. I like the interactions between the characters.I like the majority of the humor in this anime. It\'s funny to see how hard Ren tries to please Takeya, only for her to continually mess up. Also the scenes of rivalry between Ren and Miu (a more dedicated DearS) is fun to watch. While on the subject of humor, there are random scenes with two middle-aged women haggling with a fish salesman, that has no relevance to the plot, but the exchanges provide some of the best comedy.There are a few cons with this anime. For one, it doesn\'t seem to fit into a specific genre. From what I viewed it can be classified as the following: science fiction, harem, romance, drama, school, ecchi, comedy, and magical. I also feel that the ecchi elements are overdone and unnecessary to the point that it distracts from the story.Another con is the fact that literally everyone, aside from Takeya, is obsessed with the DearS. I can understand being intrigued by actual aliens, but the level of obsession comes across as unrealistic and overdone.Also there is some confusion on the DearS\' laws. I won\'t go into detail about this, but some of the rules, especially concerning their purpose for existence, seems to contradict itself.Characters (5):The characters are a hit or miss for me. There are some that I absolutely adore, and others that irritate me everytime they appear on screen.To begin with, the main character Takeya is a typical high school student. He lives on his own, requiring him to work a part-time job after school. He is portrayed as rude and abrasive. I like this character. This is a character I haven\'t seen very often in anime, so I applaud DearS for having someone with this type of personality as a protagonist. Takeya stands out from many other harem anime leads.I find the secondary character, Ren, to be likable. Due to her not having a formal DearS education, there is a lot that she does not understand. In fact, Ren actually says, ""Ren does not understand,"" or a variation of that phrase countless times in the anime. Despite her ignorance, Ren is shown to be trying her hardest in every task assigned to her, making for a few comical moments. Even with her failures, she can still win the audience\'s hearts.I like how Takeya and Ren grow together. While at first Takeya hates the thought of looking after Ren, it is cute to watch their relationship grow. It\'s clear that Takeya does try to protect Ren, and encourages her to think for herself.Takeya\'s friend Neneko is a supporting character who helps Takeya out with his unfortunate problem. She serves as a helpful companion for Takeya, strong where he is lacking. I think it would have been difficult for Takeya to get through the beginning of his relationship with Ren had it not been for Neneko\'s assistance.The other main DearS character, Miu, serves as a foil for Ren. Unlike Ren, she has been well taught, and is proud of her accomplishments. It angers her greatly to see how much Ren lacks, and how she is allowed to get away with her unorthodox behavior. At first it may seem that Miu is being unnecessarily mean to Ren, but in episode eight, the audience gets a glimpse at her backstory, which explains why she strongly believes good intentions are not enough. Of all the characters, I find Miu to be the one who develops the most throughout the story. Some of my favorite scenes are the endearing interactions between Miu and her host family.As mentioned earlier, the nameless side characters add to the comedy and ambiance of the show.However, there are three characters in particular that I found annoying.The first is the catlike DearS Nia. I\'m sure she is supposed to be cute, and maybe in the original audio she is (I watched the dubbed version), but I found her to be a nuisance. For one, she\'s all over the place, always forgetting about her mission. I can\'t take her seriously, which makes me unable to take all of the DearS community leaders seriously. Secondly, the constant repetition of ""Nia, nia, nia"" during her dialogue gets old quick. It\'s not cute, just annoying. Again, I\'m not sure if this exists in the original audio, but I cringed everytime she spoke in the English dub.As annoying as Nia may be, she is a mere speck compared to Takeya\'s little sister, Natsuki. I was ready for her to leave the instant she was introduced. Whereas Nia serves a purpose to the plot, Natsuki is completely irrelevant to the story. If she was omitted from what little screen time she gets, nothing about the plot would change. She is rude to Ren, violent towards Takeya, and won\'t allow anyone to get a word in before jumping to conclusions. In short, she is frustrating to watch.Then of course there is Takeya\'s teacher. I think she is meant for comic relief, however I feel uncomfortable watching any scene including her. Sadly, she had the potential to be funny, but she is so exaggerated that it ruins the ""humor"" for me.Art (6):The character designs are interesting. I like how there is a distinct difference between the humans and the aliens. The humans have a more neutral color scheme whereas the DearS are full of color. The aliens have the unnatural hair colors anime is famous for, they have the colorful cultural costumes. Their eyes are larger and on the whole are designed to be more beautiful than the human characters. Even the male DearS such as Khi and Xaki stand out from the earthlings.On the same note, I think it\'s an interesting choice that the protagonist is designed to look plain, even among the other humans. The other male characters in his class have more interesting designs (and personalities). I guess this choice was made so that by having him not stand out, he ironically does. Also, perhaps it was to give more attention to the aliens by comparison. It could also represent that he is the only person who is not enchanted by the DearS. Whatever the reason, I found it to be an effective decision.I also found the animation to be pretty.Sound (4):I watched the English dub of this anime, so I can\'t say much on the original audio. I found the dub acting to be decent. Aside from Nia\'s dialogue, I have no complaints with the voice acting.I found the opening song to be boring (both the tempo and the singing). The ending song is more upbeat, but nothing too impressive.Conclusion (6):In conclusion, I find the story of DearS to be enjoyable and original. The character designs are pretty.I also like the wide variety of character personalities. The fact that the main character, the one person who is indifferent to the DearS, is the one who is paired with one makes for an amusing plot.I like the humor based on the misunderstandings, as well as the minor characters who get a fair amount of screen time.However, the overuse of ecchi in addition to a few annoying characters, and confusing concepts detract from anime.I\'m glad I viewed DearS, but I probably won\'t watch it a second time.6/10.', 'A pure ufo harem story, with comedy, and overly beautiful cute characters. Doesn\'t try to do a overly deep-end-boring plot when there\'s no need for it. Some series do need a plot, not this one. Watch this if you need something easy to view. Also recommend watching Sora no Otoshimono, if you haven\'t already.Anime became sort of ""more animated"" in years 2001-2003, less still-frames and more computerized bezier curves instead of unreliable pencils. Both the old and new -styles have their pros and cons but DearS art and animation is of the newstyle, in a good way.Personally, I enjoy story that has depth but also...see when it does more harm. Everyone bashes this as a bad Chobits copy. Watched Chobits before this, it\'s a wholly different ""creature"".

Since the ship could not be fixed, the Japanese government gave the aliens citizenship and taught them about Japanese language, customs, and culture. They started a program for the aliens to stay with Japanese families to help them become familiar with human society. One of the aliens, Ren, was accidentally dropped into a river and saved by a high school student named Takeya Ikuhara. Despite his initial distrust of aliens, Takeya takes pity on Ren and she becomes his personal ""slave"" after imprinting on him as her ""Master.""

While the fluidity is good, there are also many scenes with characters just talking without much movement. Additionally, the character designs are not as appealing as the manga\'s art. The anime\'s style is too sharp and exaggerated, with odd facial features that may not be suitable for a series where the emphasis is on the attractiveness of the female characters.Characters:The easiest way to describe the characters in DearS is as boring. They are blatant ripoffs of the ecchi anime character pool\'s highly generic and hackneyed character stereotypes. Takeya, for instance, is a perverse adolescent with an unexpectedly high moral code. Ren is a slob who frequently goes without clothes. Get my meaning? Characters are sacrificed for fan service, much like the plot, with extreme oversexualization.

Some characters are even superfluous and just exist for theatrical effect or fan service.Story and theme:A potentially interesting plot exists in DearS, but it is sacrificed in the name of fan service. The entire story revolves around Takeya\'s interactions with Ren and a few other female characters, mostly Ren. Although it is not difficult to understand anything because of the pace, the plot is also rather thin. It presents a number of ideas that may have been pursued, like Takeya\'s annoyance with his parents, but it leaves these unresolved. As a result, there is little satisfaction and no true resolution in the series\' finale. Compared to the rest of the episode, DearS\' concepts are a little more intriguing. Despite being a romantic comedy, the series portrays a blossoming relationship with a little more negativity. They make it quite evident that neither you nor anybody else can be forced to feel anything. The episode also addresses waiting for the ideal moment and adjusting to new environments. These ideas, however, are at most superficial and frequently overlooked in the fan service. The show is largely an ecchi anime, although it does have some charming love moments with sci-fi and comedy thrown in.Sound and music:It takes some getting used to the soundtrack, much like the animation. The start, which is unusual and in some ways unpleasant, can nearly be a turnoff right away. Although the conclusion is improved, it is still unspectacular. Just barely, the soundtrack succeeds in doing its job. In the show, there is a specific musical cue that is notable: a smooth jazz/soul melody plays whenever Ren changes into her alien outfit.Conclusion:The show itself does have a lot of fan service. Since DearS is primarily an ecchi for ecchi sake, it is not recommended that you take it seriously. Go watch it if you enjoy beautiful animation and artwork and are willing to ignore any plot. Some of the decent and subdued motifs can be seen if one pays close attention. and makes it anything but ordinary.Animation and visuals:The animation in the series is generally smooth, but some scenes seem unnecessary and detract from the overall quality.

Despite being a romantic comedy, the series portrays a blossoming relationship with a little more negativity. They make it quite evident that neither you nor anybody else can be forced to feel anything. The episode also addresses waiting for the ideal moment and adjusting to new environments. These ideas, however, are at most superficial and frequently overlooked in the fan service. The show is largely an ecchi anime, although it does have some charming love moments with sci-fi and comedy thrown in.Sound and music:It takes some getting used to the soundtrack, much like the animation. The start, which is unusual and in some ways unpleasant, can nearly be a turnoff right away. Although the conclusion is improved, it is still unspectacular. Just barely, the soundtrack succeeds in doing its job. In the show, there is a specific musical cue that is notable: a smooth jazz/soul melody plays whenever Ren changes into her alien outfit.Conclusion:The show itself does have a lot of fan service. Since DearS is primarily an ecchi for ecchi sake, it is not recommended that you take it seriously. Go watch it if you enjoy beautiful animation and artwork and are willing to ignore any plot. Some of the decent and subdued motifs can be seen if one pays close attention.', ""I found DearS to be a decent anime, but it really didnt grab me as much as i hoped. I liked it, but the plot really wasn't present there for me to actually fully enjoy this series. I mean, i did find quite a few moments pretty good, but it really didn't hold up to long for me tpo call it a favorite "", ""'Happy Cosumousu.'This one is old and poorly drawn show, that nevertheless deserves the high score it got from me.Because every man wants to have a DearS and Ren Ren Ren Nagusaran Ren Ru Ron Ran Ren Nakora makes a perfect waifu material.So many harem anime are aired every season, yet they somehow fail to recreate Ren in their products. Therefore this show still holds the high standard of quality waifu, despite its numerous flaws.Ren is good, she is obedient, loyal, girly and sexy. I want her. She is good waifu material.Aside from Ren and Happy Cosumousu song, there is absolutely nothing going for this...show. However it does not matter. Ren is more than enough to make this show worth to watch.Watch it for Ren, she is worth your time. show. However it does not matter. Ren is more than enough to make this show worth to watch.Watch it for Ren, she is worth your time.""]"
