I don't care what anyone else says. This is hentai with substance. Watch it. Watch it right now. WATCH IT!!!This review includes the entire anime series, not just the specials. But I don't want to be posting the same thing in two places.Story: 10/10There are a lot of very creative scenes in this anime. I can feel the passion from the creator of this series through the scenes. Also, I feel like the creator doesn't hold back with the ridiculousness of the delusions, and I appreciate the honesty. That is probably the reason why this masterpiece can...exist. There's a hilarious scene where the students are having a health checkup, when the girl weighs herself, it's 50kg, but when her friend supports her breasts from behind, it becomes 45kg. Props to the creator of thinking of such a method to show that her breasts are 5kg. There's also another scene where the girl complains that the marathon should have shorter distances for people with heavier breasts. Then, in the middle of the marathon, she's struggling while her fit friend plays with her breasts, suddenly she finds her breasts lighter and she finds it easier to run the marathon, then both of them just continue running the rest of the marathon just like that, with her friend supporting her breasts. What the fuck? What a crazy genius.Art: 10/10Amazing. Absolutely stunning. The animation puts 99% of the hentai you can find online to shame. The girl looks like something god himself had created after perfecting the skills of crafting the absolute beauty since the dawn of mankind. Every action she takes such as getting changed and cleaning the room looks natural yet alluring.Sound: 10/10The voice acting is perfect. She does not sound forced, when she's embarrassed or giving a lecture. The soundtrack and ending are great as well.Character: 10/10The girl has the ideal personality any man would want. She's playful, cheerful, sweet, caring, smart. Even without her body any man would fall in love with her personality instantly.Enjoyment: 10/10I have never enjoyed myself watching anime more than watching this anime series.Overall: 10/10Watch it. I don't care if the earth is going to end tomorrow, you watch this anime even if it's the last thing you do. exist.

Anyway, the stories are pretty much the same as the original parent story is.Ep 1: Follows Kouhai-chan on a regular day, on her way to work and what have you. Gets into a bit of trouble as is found not zipping all the way up. Cute episode I guess.Ep 2: Follows Ai finding her Onii-san\'s pornos, ends up scolding him, but breaks one of his pornos on accident. Then results in a little fanservice fun.But that is it and if anything ""fanservice"" is the keyword to highlight here. That is all this...special is for, really. Nothing more, nothing less. Although, out of the entire series, I have to say that the 2nd special is probably the best fanservice episode out of the series so far. special is for, really. Nothing more, nothing less.

I\'m reading the manga now but have not read much of it yet, so I don\'t know if they also make that much progress there. Maybe they do, or maybe it\'s just an anime-only twist. Regardless, to me this sudden disruption of the status-quo was a disappointment. And that goes doubly so for the second episode - I want my Ai-chan\'s relationship to remain pure and platonic.If I may talk about a ""special"" that I\'d like to see...for a minute, it\'d definitely be one based on the crossover manga with ""Ganbare Douki-chan"". Hopefully they do that in the future... for a minute, it\'d definitely be one based on the crossover manga with ""Ganbare Douki-chan"". Hopefully they do that in the future...']"

Hanaukyou Maid-tai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/403/Hanaukyou_Maid-tai,"[""First off I will say I orginally planned on watching this because I knew there was a newer version where it was apparently remade. It was my plan to watch this and then it's remake to see how much it had improved but in the end after watching this I couldn't even begin to think about watching a remake because of how mediocre and unentertaining this was. Not to mention each episode was incredibly short and there were two extra episodes not accounted for that I had to watch.Story- Okay this is starting to become a very generic story line where boy inherits manner with...maids money yadda yadda etc nothing new to anybody. We have our main character who's grandpa died and left him with a huge fortune and manner full of maids to &quot;service&quot; him at all times. An invariable paradise for any other man but unfortunately for our main character (who looks a lot like Brock from Pokemon) he gets an allergic reaction whenever women touch him; this is so played out nowadays to the point it is even funny anymore. So the series then proceeds to follow this average weak childish man boys daily life after inheriting the manner. Suffice to say he develops a crush on one of his maids, the only girl who apparently doesn't give him an allergic reaction (and once again so played out til the point it is ridiculous), and his attempts to I guess some would say swoon her. IDK at any rate the story was fair enough for me not to drop the series.Art- This is an old series but still I felt as if it was drawn well, what made me angry though is that main character seldom had his eyes open (just like Brock from Pokemon) and this made me think that the artists were being lazy and in turn took away from my appreciation for the art.Sound- There was no real amazing sounds here to look for which disappointed me. I didn't even like the intro or closing to the anime which makes up around a quarter of each episode and as per voice acting I kind of felt not too impressed by their choices except for a few choice maids but that's a secret I'll keep for myself as to who they were.Character- This anime failed miserably at character development I understood the characters and what they represented the second they stepped on screen and the worse part their was no real development or changes in character throughout the entire anime. This disappointed me too, at least if you're going to give me a generic story at least impress with unique character aspects.Enjoyment- I did not enjoy watching this the only reason I finished watching it is because I only drop an anime if all the episodes cannot be found.Overall- I was disappointed I do not suggest this anime to anybody unless you are into generic plots, old timey art, and crappy character development. maids money yadda yadda etc nothing new to anybody.

', ""Well, this was my first Harem anime and it was actually quite surprising at what I was watching, it was a lot better than i had expected, the humour was good with the many embarrassing situations that the maids get Taro into.I also particularly liked the side story of Taro and Mariel, but since I can't give much away, I would recommend this anime, although be warned its rated 15+ for female nudity and some mild language.I found the characters, which all had their own different traits to be a very good plot line also, with Mariel being the maid of maids, the three...sisters, Lemon Melon and Maron as the seductive types and etc.This Anime gets a 4.5 from me which is equal to 9 out of 10 on here. A must see for all Harem and Bishojo lovers out there.P.S I did not watch this for the Bishojo, I enjoy seeing boys and young men being teased in such manner. :) sisters, Lemon Melon and Maron as the seductive types and etc.This Anime gets a 4.5 from me which is equal to 9 out of 10 on here.

And by ""entertaining"" I don\'t mean it in the ""it\'s so bad it\'s entertaining"" sense like those terrible Onegai series. It\'s still a bad show, but it does at least have some redeeming qualities, which is a lot more than what you can say for other ecchis.Ecchi and Comedy. That pretty much sums up this anime. Those two are also two of my least favourite genres. Ecchi... well, not much to be said here - I dislike it for pretty much the same reason many other people dislike it, and it\'s no exception when it comes...to the ecchi elements in this anime, except that a lot of the time I was able to overlook it for some reason. The comedy... I have to say, though I\'m really not a fan of this type of comedy, ""Hanaukyou Maid-tai"" really had me laughing out loud on numerous occasions. I don\'t know why, but for the most part, I actually quite liked this series, or at least more than I expected to. There\'s not much of a continuous storyline, it is more of a collection of mini adventures focusing upon the different members of the cast... but that\'s ok, because aside from the comedy, the characters are probably what makes this anime so charming. Apart from the really annoying generic maids (with their extremely annoying voices), a lot of the characters are actually genuinely likeable, like the main character Taro, Mariel, Cynthia/Grace etc.Unfortunately, ""Hanaukyou Maid-tai"" does lack consistency, and the last couple of episodes are a real let down especially. The jokes in those last episodes feel contrived and the series is brought back down to the normal level I expect for an ecchi. At the end of the day, nothing was really resolved in the anime, which is a major disappointment for me. Still, it\'s sufficiently entertaining such that it didn\'t feel like I had to forcing myself to keep watch it, unlike the majority of say, ""Martian Successor Nadesico"". It\'s unfortunate that the show is marred by the ecchi in it. But without it, perhaps this anime wouldn\'t be what it is - perhaps it took comparisons with the more shallow characters to bring out the better one. They could have at least left the better characters out of the pr0n scenes though, which would have allowed me to decouple the good and the bad parts more in my mind :-/ to the ecchi elements in this anime, except that a lot of the time I was able to overlook it for some reason.

But he gets the biggest surprise when he discovers that his grandfather’s home is a huge mansion with hundreds of beautiful maids ready to serve him. Making matters worse (at least for Taro, but not for our viewing) is that not only does he inherit the Hanaukyo mansion, he gets the services of all of the maids 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A sudden change in his life, can he manage it?Storyline: [7/10]Basically, this anime talks about Tarou Hanaukyo’s life after he lost his mother in which he was told by his mother will to live with his grandfather. Without ever knowing who his grandfather, Tarou set his journey to stay in his grandfather house as a final tribute to his mother. But Tarou was shocked after learning that his grandfather was a wealthy man and his house is not even a house. It is a mansion in the middle of forest somewhere in Tokyo. Tarou also learn that his grandfather was already long gone and left him a video stating that he is now the head of the Hanaukyo family and inherited not only his entire fortune but also his home with many personal maids that would serve him 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Honestly, if you’re not really a true anime lover then you will quickly feel the boredom in this anime. This anime storyline is flat course. Furthermore, this anime is also a slow pace anime. You can barely feel the climax and anti-climax  in this anime. No significant confict that arise. If there is any conflict then it will be finished in that episode. For me, it eliminates all the meaning and importance of the conflict in this anime. In terms of drama, just a few episode that I find have an interesting drama but alas, the drama itself was also wrapped with a less attractive way. Finally, this anime does not have something that really stick in the minds of the watch. And that’s what makes this anime could quickly turn into boring anime.One of the advantages that this anime has is a comedic side with the right portion through entire episode. The comedy itself was a fresh comedy. This kind of comedies can make you smile and laugh while you watch this anime. The concept of anti-master/enslaved-maid that this anime bring is also one of the advantages this anime has in his time.Art: [6/10]The whole character of both men and women, both the main character and supporting character have a cute and sweet character. They also have a cute and funny facial expressions.The weak point of this anime is almost all the character in this anime does not leave strong impression for me. No special uniqueness is given to all of the character except for the clothes and the color of their clothes.For an anime who release in 2001, this is a common so-so art anime in his time.Sound: [6/10]I can only say that both OP and ED fill with OST befitted in their time. You can enjoy it but don't compare it with anime OST nowadays.Character: [7/10]This anime, generally, gives each character a standard personality for main character. Tarou with happy-go-lucky, kind, hardworking and cannot-see-people-suffering personality, Mariel with mature and motherly sense personality, Ikuyo with witty personality and a natural prankster and Konoe with strict attitude and silent type. A bit let-down for Tarou to have this women-touch allergy. For an anime with ecchi/harem theme, this is really no good.But for this 2001 anime to have a bi-personality character, Chyntia dan Grace was a great plus this anime have in his time. Chyntia is a pure and innocent kid. A kid with cheerful, easy-going and playful personality. Basically, Chyntia is a common kid in her age. Grace is genius kid. A kid with serious, hard-going and a bit tsundere personality. Basically, Grace is a polar opposite of Chyntia.Enjoyment: [6/10]Well for some anime watcher, you’re going to run into trouble in finding some little pleasure in watching this anime. Flat course storyline with a slow tempo progress anime. But despite it all, in a few episode of this anime episode gives some common knowledge and words of wisdom. Each story in this anime episode contain life lessons meaning in the end.For me, this anime shows us a 12-year-old boy’s journey into manhood. How does a boy become a man? How can a boy who for all his life just became the master for himself, must now  become the head of the huge, wealthy and respectful family? What kind of leader he become? And what kind of master he become for all his maids? This anime is filled with many life lessons.Overall: [6/10]Fan service is so-so. The comedies is in the right portions, but the drama is almost have no bite at all. This anime tempo was also slow and each episode has a different set of story so in the end, this anime doesn’t have a clear purpose and something is missing on the ending. This anime has a tendency to quickly turn into a boring anime.Interesting point is to see changes in the main character, Tarou Hanaukyo in personality and life. During the whole episode, we can see Tarou began gradually learn and understand some of the realities around him. Tarou learn to respons to situations with a cool head attitude. Sometime Tarou also said some words of wisdom and wise remarks that take him closer to maturity and the more worthy to be the head of the Hanaukyo family. Another interesting point is that this anime bring a concept of anti-master/enslaved-maid which is quite a populer issue in that time.Personal message and opinion:I like anime with a life lesson in it and even more with maids themed anime combine with ecchi/harem theme. For me, I quite enjoy old anime and the fresh comedy inside this anime. Although, to be honest, I watch this anime quite rarely. But nonetheless, I am grateful to have this anime and this anime became one of my most valuable anime that I ever got. In the end, for me it’s a good anime to watch.And..Do you know about the rumors that this anime once was originally planned for more than 12 episodes? Do you also know about the rumors that this anime once was having financial trouble? Did you know that in fact this anime once was a highly awaited anime? Did you also know that in fact this anime get a remake? You know for an anime to get a remake then it proves that that anime was a successful anime. For an example, just take a look for Dragon Ball and Hunter x Hunter who get a remake. Well, I leave back to you guys to decide if this anime worthy to watch or not!

Luckily for Tarou Hanaukyou, his previously-unknown grandfather heads a huge organization with seemingly endless resources. Tarou soon finds his way over to his grandfather\'s estate, supposedly in Toyko(?), where he is immediately overrun by literally hundreds of maids waiting for his orders. These maids are not just ordinary maids, these are specialist maids who handle everything from cleaning and construction to security and cyber-warfare; oh, and they also are trained to take Tarou\'s grandfather\'s perverse orders.Hanaukyou is a light, ecchi, not-so-ordinary slice of life. You\'ll...find a bit of comedy, a very slight amount of action, and a lot of nonsense. Considering the outrageous nature of the premise, the series doesn\'t try very hard at making it seem feasible; the series prefers to just shove more fan service in your face. Stay away from this series if you need real action, real drama, or any depth whatsoever.Animation:Admittedly, this is a dated look; unless you\'ve been watching a lot of 90\'s or earlier works you will cringe when you start this. The appearance is pretty cheap overall; there are lots of hand-blobs and other shortcuts that you don\'t see often now a days. Expect plain backgrounds and limited shading. There was also a very noticeably wrong scene earlier where a helicopter was shown flying backwards.The actual character styling isn\'t that bad, apart from Tarou appearing asleep with his eyes all the time. All the important characters are distinct except for Ichigo, Ringo, and Sango (who are only distinguishable by their uniform color and VA).This is definitely an ecchi series, though modern shows like High School DxD are pretty close. This is almost as revealing as Yosuga no Sora (though much less sexually suggestive) and much less suggestive than B Gata H Kei or Kiss X Sis. Assuming the DVD version, expect full frontal nudity shots on multiple occasions with no censoring. You have been warned.Sound:The series starts off with a very appropriate sounding and fairly catchy OP, which was purposely made for the anime based on the lyrics. The ED is less catchy and features random 3D girls for an unknown reason. I think it worked better in Lucky Star than here. The BGM is noticeably aged but does include some memorable melodies. Overall, the sound quality is a tad low, and some sound effects are way overused.As for VAs, the main maid, is voiced by Rie Tanaka; this is really the only reason why I even bothered to pick this up. She gives her a surprisingly mature tone relative to all the other maids. The performance was average overall.Story:In this version of Hanaukyou the story is very random. While sequential, each episode is wildly different in theme. There really isn\'t much of a main story line to form a coherent backbone, and so there really isn\'t any motive for watching multiple episodes together other than the very short 15min running time per episode. Basically, expect Tarou to slowly get acquainted with his new surroundings and servants, as various maids\' antics keep everyone busy.As for plot development, there really isn\'t any rising action or climax in this show. I didn\'t even realize when the original season stopped and the OVA started. The only series I can think of to compare this to is Princess Lover. And to be honest, that crazy series is actually more believable than this one. Hanaukyou just never feels palpable, and it doesn\'t help when they introduce seemingly random elements such as a private blimp or the world\'s most powerful computer, which apparently runs on GOTO statements (as a programmer I was quite offended when a computer hacking situation was depicted as a version of Space Invaders).Character:Though there are hundreds of mains that apparently serve Tarou, these maids obviously serve in different ways. Based on the series, Tarou only interacts on a daily basis with a handful of them. Some of these interactions are playful (you can expect some background info on these) while others are more carnal. Tarou has a big problem with the latter type as he is apparently allergic to women; he has a mysterious gift that causes him and his clothes to change between different shades of color. This is true except for his main maid Mariel who not only can touch Tarou but can also miraculously cure him of his symptoms. You\'d guess that the series is trying to guide something to happen but don\'t be fooled, there is virtually zero romance in this work. It\'s all lighthearted; including when Tarou gets kicked and flies 500 meters.I almost forgot to mention that Tarou is as wimpy and hopeless as male protagonists come. Other than being ""nice"", he has no redeeming characteristic; he\'s allergic to girls, physically and mentally weak, and has barely any semblance of personal willpower. I assume this is not supposed to be a role model for Japanese dudes.Value:I was expecting a bit more depth from this work. If you really really want the ecchi parts, then stick with this series. Otherwise... if you\'re looking for cute maids and some drama check out Kaichou wa Maid-sama! If you\'re going for more of a harem-type try out Princess Lover. If you\'re going for the innocent little boy aspect I\'d try the Negima series instead.

Gift: Eternal Rainbow,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1581/Gift__Eternal_Rainbow,"[""To tell you the truth, I did not expect much from these series..but then, it seems I was wrong xD.Story: the story is the usuall love triangle that I have seen so many times.A childhood friend and a male protagonist getting along when another old friend that the male character had a crush on( usually) comes back and there goes the triangle. However, the story was, nonetheless, good. It wasn't boring, although there wasn'nt anything that stood out that much.Art: the art overall was pretty good, and the figures didn't seem out of place. The characters were drawn nicely. The art did...certainly bring the rating of this series up.Sound: the sound was also very nicely fit into the scenes. It really helped set the right atmosphere to each of the scenes that it was put in.Character: The characters were nothing new, as this type of genre is common, and their actions were almost always predictable. It would have been much better if there was somehting more unique about the characters... but then that may as well have affected the story as a whole.But this does in no way mean that the characters were shallow. They were well, thought out and each character has his or her own development in the story.Enjoyment: I really enjoyed these series, it was one of the series were i could lay back and enjoy the whole series, without troubling myself on trying too hard to think in depth on in.Overall: Overall, I think these serie is really worth watching if you like romance stories and have got the time. I wouldn't say that its a Must-See, but still it is worth the time. certainly bring the rating of this series up.Sound: the sound was also very nicely fit into the scenes.

Really, what isn\'t based on an H-Game nowadays?  In any case, I decided to watch it simply on the basis that it had no reviews on AnimeNfo.  As such, I did not have high expectations.  However, it turned out to be a decent show.  By no means was it anything special, but it was somewhat enjoyable.STORY: 5/10The story of ""Gift"" isn\'t a particularly great one, and it doesn’t always make a whole lot of sense.  Not to mention that the gimmick of this series, the Gifts themselves, are...really kind of unimportant in the grand scheme of things.  “Gift” is a romance, complicated by the sibling-esque relationship between Haruhiko and Riko and by the obligatory H-Game diversions.  The show spends too much time on side characters.  I assume their stories are nods to the source material, but they are simply unnecessary.  As regards the relationship between Haruhiko and Riko, its effects don\'t feel well-considered in the long run, although it eventually doesn\'t matter.  Once their relationship issues are ""resolved,"" the story accelerates rapidly into a love triangle full of drama and betrayal for the final third of the series, with Gifts and the mysteries behind them playing a more central role.  Although these elements are interesting, they feel like a bit of an afterthought.  I did like the love triangle, though.  It was well-motivated, although it was certainly melodramatic.  The double-childhood-friend angle was a bit original.Overall: 5/10 – What is essentially generic drivel is redeemed slightly by…I don’t know…the cuteness of the first arc and the intensity and understandable motivation of the last arc?  “Please Twins” did a better job handling character responses in a siblings-but-not plot.  “KgNE” and “True Tears” had more compelling triangles.  Still, though, “Gift” wasn’t terrible.  It just wasn’t particularly great.ART: 4/10Character Designs: Enormous eyes, almost completely filled by the irises.  It took a while to get used to it.  While this eye design seems to be increasingly common in bishoujo characters, it was odd (in a bad way) to see such large irises in the male lead.  Also, the character designs, especially that of the male lead, are very inconsistent.  This was most noticeable in facial design and hair, although it occasionally extended to female body proportions.  The male lead fluctuated between being cool and attractive (ep 11) and being goofy-looking (ep 1).  However, the female leads were consistently decent-looking, and occasionally very pretty.  Riko looks a bit too much like Lucy/Nyu from ""Elfen Lied"" at times, though, which was...peculiar.  The color palette is bright, just the way I usually like it.Background Art: Nothing particularly amazing, but it was pleasant and consistent.  Pretty much standard in recent years, it seems.Animation: Nothing impressive, but nothing noticeably bad.  Seemed fluid enough for its purposes.Cinematography: I didn\'t notice anything particularly noteworthy.  Pretty standard shots.Overall: 4/10 - The inexcusable lack of consistency drags a decent visual production down to a bad one.  It still has its rare moments of beauty, though.SOUND: 6/10OP: A pleasant but non-compelling piece.  Guitars (acoustic and bass), strings, and vocals are layered on top of an uptempo rock/break beat.  I\'ve encountered quite a few of these lately.BGM: Pleasant, appropriate, and yet forgettable.ED: Actually kind of interesting due to the visual sync with Riko playing the guitar (with actual chords).  Otherwise, it\'s pleasant but nothing memorable.Voice Acting: As someone who is not a native Japanese speaker, I cannot hope to catch the subtleties of delivery.  However, for what it\'s worth, I thought that all the seiyuu were appropriate and matched their characters and their emotions.  Also, the occasional non-verbal noises caught my attention and were appreciated.Sound FX: Gift effects sounded cheesy.  It was kinda inevitable, though.  Not a big deal.Overall: 6/10 - Enjoyable all-around, but forgettable.CHARACTER: 6/10The characters, in general, were pretty flat or caricature-ish.  Background stories were limited to the three leads, primarily to Haruhiko.  However, Kirino and Riko acquired a little depth by the end.  In addition, Riko and Haruhiko had good rapport as siblings...which was kind of wasted by the romance.Haruhiko: A pretty generic harem-type lead at first, but perhaps a bit more empathetic and open with his feelings.  Over time, he seems to become a better person, although I get the sense that this was due only slightly to character development and mostly to inconsistent writing.Kirino: A shy, pleasant girl who likes Haruhiko.  She has a more complex relationship with Riko than initially meets the eye.  I don’t want to spoil much, so I’ll just say that I liked her motivation in the final arc, although that’s primarily because she simply HAD an understandable motive.Riko: Basically Haruhiko’s adopted sister, who had to leave him years ago.  They were great and lively friends, something maintained in their playful treatment of each other.  She’s feisty and cheerful, but has a sensitive side and a selfish side that overwhelm her on occasion.  She also has a fear of being/becoming alone.  If you pay attention, you might notice that she uses slight regression under severe stress.  Nice Freudian touch.  Also, I was surprised by how kawaii she occasionally managed to be (kawaii enough for me to use fangirl Japanese to describe it).  As an afterthought, I remember that I appreciated that she insisted on carrying her own suitcase instead of letting the male lead do it for her.Maki: A supporting character and friend of Haruhiko, although he is more a caricature than a true character.  He is the smart, controlling, cold-hard-rational-science-obsessed guy, although he’s really not scientific in his methods.  He’s calm and collected, and he also considers the feelings of his friends, which is nice.Then, in addition to these, there are all the girls who probably have their own routes in the game, like Rinka, Chisa, Yukari, and possibly someone on the student council.  None of these characters seemed important in any way, really, and I think they detract from the overall experience, making it less focused than it could have been.In terms of interpersonal relationships, we are often left with such ambiguous descriptions as declarations of “love.”  However, Kirino eventually describes something a little bit more specific, and it isn’t too hard to figure out what drives Riko’s relationship with Haruhiko (he cares about her, pays attention to her, and is simply there for her, almost as family).  Additionally, the relationship between Riko and Haruhiko is supported by a bit of casual banter near the beginning of the series, which actually seems to go a long way in showing their mutual compatibility in the long run.  Still, I feel that the relationships in “Gift” are sketchy, primarily because what Haruhiko sees in the girls and/or wants from a relationship with the girls remains a mystery to the audience.Overall: 6/10 – There are a lot of cardboard cutouts, especially at the beginning, when only Riko seems to have any depth, and that’s only because of the way she interacts with her foster brother.  On top of that, many are completely unnecessary to the story.  However, the added depth to the characters of Riko and Kirino, by the end of the series, manage to pull “Gift” out of the realm of mediocrity and into the realm of decency.ENJOYMENT: 7/10The odd thing about “Gift ~eternal rainbow~” is that, despite its flaws and rather unremarkable basic essence, I really enjoyed it.  Well, I didn’t enjoy it THAT much, but it was a pleasant surprise.  It’s probably because I didn’t expect much, as that tends to increase my overall impression.  So, really, “Gift” is an unremarkable but generally pleasant romantic drama, with occasional points of noticeable enjoyment, usually provided by Riko in some manner.  As such, I have rated my enjoyment as a 7/10.I guess enjoyment would also depend on one’s tolerance for H-Game fare and harem fare: the stuff of male wish-fulfillment.  My patience for such content has yet to be depleted, since I usually avoid the genres.  “Gift” is far from being the worst of this kind of stuff, but it certainly cannot hold its own against the best shows these genres have to offer, which are often respectable titles within the whole of anime, across genres.SIMPLIFIED RECOMMENDATION: Watch it if you’re in the mood for or have run out of other pleasant romances.  Don’t watch it if you’re sick of somewhat shoddy character and plot constructions. really kind of unimportant in the grand scheme of things.  “Gift” is a romance, complicated by the sibling-esque relationship between Haruhiko and Riko and by the obligatory H-Game diversions.

A-Anyways, time to review!Story: 9/10Let me begin by stating my first impression that I was going to put the story down to a 6 or even a 5, but I was really wrong. This story started off happy, then kept getting better and better as it progressed. A good story always comes with a a good setting, problem and climax, which is why I would think this is a good story. Aside from...the romance and school genre, there is not a lot of comedy in this anime. I would take comedy out and replace it with drama, as it somewhat hit me right in the heart. Manipulating your audience\'s emotions, mainly happiness but sometimes sadness, with a story will no doubt- bring a good anime.Art: 7/10An anime from about 8 years ago, is above average for its art. I\'ve seen anime from that time period that have really bad art, not naming any. Animation was smooth but not a lot of detail put into the characters. Also, there is one episode where Riko\'s eyes were literally 2/3 the size of her head, but I can\'t remember which episode it was. Feel free to find it, I doubt you will.Sound: 7/10The piano piece that was played was very nice, bringing me on a wander in my thoughts. Ever heard of a Katawa Shoujo OST? I would say it\'s around its level. I\'m not a fan of reviewing OP and ED that much, but I could say it\'s so-so. The first time you hear the OP, is that you might think that this is a romance anime.Character: 7/10I\'ll start on the protagonist:Amami Haruhiko, a person who would do anything to fix relationships that involve him. A hardworking and a kind person. Not a pervert, thank god.Fukamine Riko, Haruhiko\'s non-blood related sister who loves Haruhiko very much. A good cook, a good ""cleaner"", undoubtedly these aspects of hers would make her a very good housewife.Konosaka Kirino, Haruhiko\'s childhood friend and a character I kinda hated, even thought a character like her was needed for this type of anime. The type of girl who wants everything the way she wants it to be. I swear she\'s mental, but thank god her brain was fixed. She gave that \'yandere\' aura on her, that would kill the girl that Haruhiko likes because she was a childhood friend, spent more time than that girl Haruhiko likes, and won\'t give up on Haruhiko. Did I mention she likes Haruhiko?I didn\'t mention the best character I think was out there, which was Edo Masaki. A side character and is Haruhiko\'s \'best\' friend and would help him out anytime Haruhiko is in some kind of knot with either Riko, Kirino or both. The most helpful character in this series, no doubt.Enjoyment: 9/10I enjoyed this mainly because of the story because it hit me in the feels. Kept me on my toes to watch until the end and it didn\'t disappoint me. Would I re-watch this? Maybe.Overall: 8/10If you\'re looking for an anime that is related to Shuffle!, then this anime might be for you. Not as long, but I would say it has similar stories, just different characters. the romance and school genre, there is not a lot of comedy in this anime. I would take comedy out and replace it with drama, as it somewhat hit me right in the heart. Manipulating your audience\'s emotions, mainly happiness but sometimes sadness, with a story will no doubt- bring a good anime.Art: 7/10An anime from about 8 years ago, is above average for its art. I\'ve seen anime from that time period that have really bad art, not naming any. Animation was smooth but not a lot of detail put into the characters. Also, there is one episode where Riko\'s eyes were literally 2/3 the size of her head, but I can\'t remember which episode it was. Feel free to find it, I doubt you will.Sound: 7/10The piano piece that was played was very nice, bringing me on a wander in my thoughts. Ever heard of a Katawa Shoujo OST? I would say it\'s around its level. I\'m not a fan of reviewing OP and ED that much, but I could say it\'s so-so. The first time you hear the OP, is that you might think that this is a romance anime.Character: 7/10I\'ll start on the protagonist:Amami Haruhiko, a person who would do anything to fix relationships that involve him. A hardworking and a kind person. Not a pervert, thank god.Fukamine Riko, Haruhiko\'s non-blood related sister who loves Haruhiko very much. A good cook, a good ""cleaner"", undoubtedly these aspects of hers would make her a very good housewife.Konosaka Kirino, Haruhiko\'s childhood friend and a character I kinda hated, even thought a character like her was needed for this type of anime. The type of girl who wants everything the way she wants it to be. I swear she\'s mental, but thank god her brain was fixed. She gave that \'yandere\' aura on her, that would kill the girl that Haruhiko likes because she was a childhood friend, spent more time than that girl Haruhiko likes, and won\'t give up on Haruhiko. Did I mention she likes Haruhiko?I didn\'t mention the best character I think was out there, which was Edo Masaki. A side character and is Haruhiko\'s \'best\' friend and would help him out anytime Haruhiko is in some kind of knot with either Riko, Kirino or both. The most helpful character in this series, no doubt.Enjoyment: 9/10I enjoyed this mainly because of the story because it hit me in the feels. Kept me on my toes to watch until the end and it didn\'t disappoint me. Would I re-watch this? Maybe.Overall: 8/10If you\'re looking for an anime that is related to Shuffle!, then this anime might be for you.

The story follows a well-known formula of a love triangle between childhood friends and a male protagonist. Despite this, the plot is engaging and manages to avoid being boring.The art is commendable, with well-drawn figures that blend seamlessly into the scenes. The characters are also skillfully drawn, which contributes to the overall quality. The sound elements are integrated well, establishing the right atmosphere for each situation. The soundtrack plays a crucial role in enhancing the viewing experience.The characters are not unique and follow typical genre tropes, making...their actions predictable. There could have been some more uniqueness in character traits to improve the show, but it might have impacted the overarching story. However, the characters are still well-developed, with each having their own growth throughout the narrative.Overall, if you enjoy romance stories and have the time, this show is worth a watch.

Yet another 2000s harem anime that's absolutely not harem and is instead a love triangle.The people tagging these anime have no idea what they're doing and honestly its infuriating seeing most love triangle shows labeled as harem.Anyways, onto the anime in question. Its an absolute snoozefest. The entire gift gimmick with the powers quickly runs dry. The Eternal Rainbow isn't nearly as impactful or deeply integrated into the plot as is the everlasting sakura in Da Capo. Which this anime rips off in some sense.Besides that, the love triangle itself is...decent. Its the same old troupe that's plagued 2000s romance anime for the longest time. A show that builds chemistry with seemingly obvious love interest, only to pull a fast one and pair up unlikely people. Atleast it concludes fairly well with some decent closure. But they could've handled the dynamics between the protagonist and the two girls a little better.Especially considering the protagonist can easily be one of the biggest turn offs of the entire show. Where the writers can't decide on whether he's a kind hearted and caring individual or an ignorant oblivious cuck bumbling his way through interactions. This dichotomy in his character gets tiring, when I'd rather the show give me either one of the two characters archetypes instead of this weird amalgation.The cast is wonderful, for the little screentime they get. The writers are allergic to its supporting cast, and would rather senselessly drag issues between the three leads instead of focusing a little more on its arguably strongest suit.Speaking on issues, every single story beat or arc feels unnecessarily fabricated or manufactured. The weight in most of these scenes is seemingly fleeting because the love triangle is in a constant limbo. They spend majority of its runtime on the contexts behind the romance, with laughably minimal interactions resulting from this.Overall, this is bad love triangle anime. Not a harem in the slightest sense. Forgotten side cast that are more interesting than main case. Watch something else. This was pure mid in every since or the word. decent.

Ikkitousen: Shuugaku Toushi Keppuuroku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11255/Ikkitousen__Shuugaku_Toushi_Keppuuroku,"['If you think about it, Ikkitousen has been around for a while. It\'s inception into anime form started with JC Staff in 2003, being amongst other action oriented ecchi shows like Tenjou Tenge, Air Master and Grenadier. After that first season, the series was given to Arms and they produced Dragon Destiny for 2007, Great Guardians for 2008, and Xtreme Xecutor for 2010. So here is Ikkitousen: Shuugaku Toushi Keppuuroku which is supposed to be a sequel to Xtreme Xecutor. But honestly, I feel as though this edition of Ikki is either a little misplaced in the timeline, or it just could have done more...than just more Ikkitousen for the sake of it.Shuugaku is touted as the sequel to Xtreme Xecutor, but to me it feels more like an abridged retelling of the series. The story is more of a callback to Ikki season one, where it\'s pretty much about rival schools fighting all over Kanto. Since Shuugaku only lasts for about 45 minutes, it doesn\'t go into a long exposition about Ikki\'s Romance of the Three Kingdom mythos as it has previously, but rather just reminds you the show to loosely based off of the novel. So most of my understanding of the story can be summarized by saying ""Oh yeah. That\'s what this series is about. I remember now."" as opposed to introducing a new conflict or bringing a conclusion to something that has a few lose ends, and I feel as though Xtreme Xecutor left a few things open for further exploration. I guess I should mention that the premise of Shuugaku is that everyone is on a class trip, but it\'s in all honestly irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.The characters in Shuugaku remain largely unchanged. Hakufu is still silly, Ryomou is still serious, and Kan\'u is still kind to her allies and aggressive to her opponents. So the star femme fatales and few male leads that you\'ve met in a previous season of Ikki haven\'t changed at all for better or for worse, through probably for better given the scope of Shuugaku. But I still stand by my saying that Shuugaku doesn\'t feel like a fulfilling continuation or conclusion to the events of Xtreme Xecutor. The interactions between certain characters feels like two steps back after taking a step forward in a previous season. Either I\'m just missing something or refusing to accept the reality, but I still dare to say that if certain characters weren\'t present, Shuugaku would be a better continuation or side story to Dragon Destiny.One of the draws that Ikki has is its action, which in my opinion hasn\'t been super fantastical but still pretty interesting and satisfying. Shuugaku features two main battle royals that are satisfying to a certain extent. Personally I feel as though the martial arts action Ikki peaked in Great Guardians, which by comparison makes the battles in Shuugaku feel somewhat stale. But the tropes of the series are still present: Two or more hot babes battling it out until their clothes are torn up to the point where they\'re piratically topless. No complaints in that regard, but I still yearn for the return of the more action heavy high octane fights that happened in Great Guardians.And lastly, the ecchi. No special amount of nudity, but there\'s enough service to say that it\'s in there.Ikkitousen: Shuugaku Toushi Keppuuroku is pretty much more Ikkitousen. It could have done more to feel like a true continuation of the series as opposed to just reiterating the original plot points. Despite my relative disappointment with Shuugaku, I still somewhat like it for what it is, but it leaves me with wanting Ikki to go on for at least one more season in hopes of getting a satisfying ending. So hopefully there\'s more to come and that this is just the beginning of the series\' final conclusion, because this alone is not enough, especially when there\'s the potential to push things forward in a meaningful way. than just more Ikkitousen for the sake of it.Shuugaku is touted as the sequel to Xtreme Xecutor, but to me it feels more like an abridged retelling of the series.

It takes place directly after Xtrem Xecutor.I liked the first four series as an enjoyable ecchi with good fights. Good, but not that amazing. I went to Shuugaku Toushi Keppuroku with the same expect, but i was really surprised. In fact, at the end of the 40min, I had this satisfying feeling that you get when you watch something really breathtaking.The OAV is divided in two parts : two fights. I would rather say : Two fucking amazing big fights. They really takes part of my favourite.While mixing ecchi and martial arts is sometimes...boring for many anime watchers, this 'add' to Ikki tousen exactly show the opposite. If you watched the previous seasons, it's a must-to-watch. You can give it a try if you don't know Ikki Tousen I think, there is not so much spoil in it. boring for many anime watchers, this 'add' to Ikki tousen exactly show the opposite.

The show never has really gone out of it's way to explain the plot very well, probably because they know that's not why you're here. If I understand it right, while on their school trip the fighters from around Kanto who are reincarnations of Three Kingdoms Period generals have to face off against the fighters from Kyoto or where ever their school trip was and win some little medallions that I think are the Kyoto equivalent of the Magatama all the Toushi carry. I think that means these Kyoto guys are reincarnations of Japanese fighters rather...than Chinese ones, like I said it's not really made clear.Either way the OVA devolves into this weird rivalry between the apparent frenemies of Nanyo and Seito schools. I had assumed that after all they had been through together, all these guys would be on more friendly terms by now. I guess it's just supposed to be the nature of Toushi that they're always going to want to fight and the history of the nations they're based on was one of war. Anyway it was a neat special and somewhat interesting new setting for the characters, I give it a 7/10 than Chinese ones, like I said it's not really made clear.Either way the OVA devolves into this weird rivalry between the apparent frenemies of Nanyo and Seito schools.

Kaguya-hime,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29927/Kaguya-hime,"['Another take on the Kaguya-hime (The tale of the Bamboo Cutter) this time using paper puppets and stop motion. I\'ve been wanting to watch this adoption for quite a few years now - see as it is probably one of the first animated adaptations of this story.The animation itself has a rustic feel to it, thanks to the use of the paper puppets and layout. I think this gave a nice aura to the story and felt visually pleasing while at the same time it felt like being thrown into a time machine viewing such, what would now be considered, a simple method of animation....Though when thinking about it, an anime of this quality being made back then would have taken up a lot of work and time. So if anything it adds to the value of this short movie.The characters were all there, from the Bamboo cutter to the three princes...? (not too sure what to call them) and they all played their part well, staying true to the story. So I had no fault there. The voice acting fit very well for each of the characters as well.The music used was very ""classical"". Only a few moments went without music. Majority of the adoption contained ongoing music piece which would change in tune and tempo to help set the mood.The only ""fault"" that I could find is my lack in knowledge of the Japanese language. Thankfully, I know the tale quite well, so I knew what was going on. But it wouldn\'t hurt to find a version with subtitles - maybe in a couple of years one will pop up.Overall I enjoyed this short little movie. I\'m glad after so many years it is up for viewing. You\'ll really feel like you\'re back in your childhood watching really old school Disney shorts that would play before the actual movie. With a vibe of a children\'s puppet show. If you have 26 minutes to spare I suggest giving this a watch, it\'s an enjoyable view even with the lack of subtitles. Though I do suggest to watch one of the other adaptions first so you can grasp what is going on.

Joshikousei: Girl's High,https://myanimelist.net/anime/863/Joshikousei__Girls_High,"[""High School girls is a straight forward comedy with a lot of in your face jokes about the lives of a group of girlfriends attending a high school. They don't joke about typical things that are safe for children. Rather, they take the more adult oriented ecchi route and run with it.Story (Good)The story runs in a typical sitcom style, with every &quot;issue&quot; solved in 30 minutes or less. Things usually start in a safe manner (like going to gym class or going karaoke), but by the end it just ends up all sexed up and wacky. Sexual innuendo's are all over this show....Thats part of this shows charm and makes it pretty entertaining (if you like that kind of stuff).Art (Decent) --- Sound (Mediocre)The art and sound is all pretty average for what its worth. Art is not too detailed but not too simplistic. It's very... AVERAGE. Although they drew the girls all cute like and hilarious, you can tell that everything else (backgrounds, static objects, etc) had less time taken to produce. The sound has typical anime comedy sounds but what helps out the most is the music in the show. It's all so very upbeat and happy, I could hear Kirameku (op song) over and over and it won't get old. Even after a year of finishing this show, I still enjoy that song as much as I did the first time heard it.Character (Good)This show doesn't have much in terms of sound, story, or art. So High School Girl's  trump card to make this show remotely worth watching are the high school girls. With the lack of men in the show the girls all take center stage and make for some pretty unique moments. Particularly from all the innuendo jokes. Those moments are so wrong, its hilarious. The girls aren't even over developed as you would expect from an ecchi comedy. Rather they're all drawn like normal looking girls, which help enhance the comedy.Overall if you enjoy a good ecchi comedy that more based on situational jokes rather than blatant fanservice with a few jokes. Give this one a shot. It is definitely for anyone who enjoys a dirty joke or two. And a special note: some of the funniest jokes are at the very end after the credits.

Nonetheless, each episode helps the characters become more and more enjoyable.Art:Again nothing special.

Along the way we visit the Sports Fest, the Culture Fest, we go to amusement parks, sing karaoke, and even go to a love hotel!

We have the sweet girl, the innocent girl, the tsundere, the girl who loses her viriginity, and a couple more cuties...thrown in for good measure.  I liked the fact that there are 6 girls in the main storyline instead of 3 or 4 you sometimes get with these high school shows.What makes the show good is the character development of the girls.  The interaction and friendships among them work well and there are a few mild subplots that also carry interest throughout.We also have the usual male teachers leering after the girls and of course that makes for some hilarity.There is a fair amount of naughty humor and indecent situations, more than you'd see in most other HS shows.  This is why I HIGHLY recommend this for fanboys.Hey, the girls are cute, the show is fun to watch, and there's pretty good repeat value too.

The interaction and friendships among them work well and there are a few mild subplots that also carry interest throughout.We also have the usual male teachers leering after the girls and of course that makes for some hilarity.There is a fair amount of naughty humor and indecent situations, more than you'd see in most other HS shows.  This is why I HIGHLY recommend this for fanboys.Hey, the girls are cute, the show is fun to watch, and there's pretty good repeat value too.  High School Girls is a winner in my book!"", 'While browsing titles for something with a high school setting, I stumbled upon Girl\'s High... Six high school girls and their misadventures, plus some ecchi? There was no reason for me not to give this a chance.Each one of the six MCs has her own personality: there\'s an immature one (make it two, actually), a petite one, a shy one, a mature one, and one that wants to be an actress. I must say that I liked each and every one of them; there was no MC that I hated. I really liked how the characters were created (which includes their designs), as well as...their relations. They do have their bickering, but at the end of the day, they stick together to overcome any problem they run into. A bit cliché maybe, but it still works for me.The sound is also good. I especially liked the ending theme.Why I liked this anime: while watching, I kept seeing things that I wanted to see. For example, in TV shows with a high school setting, I really like to see the antagonist: usually a rich and popular girl who plays the MC\'s rival. There was such a character here. Then there were some (mildly) dirty jokes, innuendos... I simply couldn\'t dislike that.Another good thing about Girl\'s High is that, unlike some similar titles, episodes don\'t look like each other: they explore different parts of the girl\'s lives. In one episode the girls have a dating party, in another they participate in the school sports fest, then they go to the swimming pool, then the culture fest... I liked the variety of stories.What about ecchi? Well, much to my misfortune, there\'s no nudity here; just a great amount of pantyshots, especially in the first few episodes. It\'s just not my thing (personally, I don\'t even consider anime an ecchi just because it has lots of pantyshots), and I would\'ve liked it better if they showed us some boobs, but it\'s not a big complaint.At the end, I was disappointed because this anime only has one season. The last episode left some space for more episodes, but unfortunately, apart from three short OVA episodes, there\'s nothing more. Which is such a darn shame.To put it shortly, this anime reminded me of Azumanga (six high school girls and their everyday lives), but with more mature humor. Since I like both Azumanga and mature humor, this anime was almost bound to ""buy"" me. And it did. Okay, I can\'t say it\'s my new favorite thing, but it was definitely worth my time. their relations.

I wouldn't say it was what started my love for Anime, as it was Clannad that did that, and we can all understand why.Even so, High School Girls introduced me to the types of stories Anime offers. This particular programme has many, with a variety which I love. It starts out as being quite adult orientated it seems, with adult themes and ideas. Certainly not one for the kids. As the stories progress though, there is more focus on developing the characters themselves, rather...than pleasing the people that want a shot of underwear, something which I'm glad of. Therefore I believe the stories deserve an 8/10. They're very good. As it was my first series to watch, I got a good taste of what to expect from similar programmes. The hardcore anime fan won't like how there isn't any real storyline, it jumps from one theme to the next.The art is good, I can't speak much negativity about it. It's designed to make the series itself enjoyable, not something you gawp over how good the extra effects are. That simplicity is what I like. However the only negative I have is some of the clothing there are is a little odd. I'm talking about Kouda especially. I didn't see the point of trying to get an extra laugh out of making her clothing occasionally overly sexual. Oh well.A decent theme tune. I like it. You remember how it goes. Being knowledgeable in music I know how it can influence programmes and this tune in particular helps to emphasise the enjoyment you should get out of the show. On the in show music, you normally hear a monophonic piano melody which accompanies dialogue. It also includes fart sounds, which honestly works, again adding to the fun factor. Although, this piano melody happens too often. There could be more variety.The characters. Ah! They really nailed it! Each girl has a personality that befits their look, and they respond to situations how they should. My highlight of the series was Ogawa being taken to the love hotel, yet saving herself without even realising it because she is meant to be very innocent. It's not just one character though. Koudas flamboyance is contrasted by Ayanos shyness and daring with her boyfriend Shimotakatani. There is a lot to like about High School Girls, but the characters traits are what you have to like the most.I enjoyed the series. I really did. So much so I have rewatched it, to relive what got me into anime in the first place. The humour is enjoyable, as is the simplicity. Some animus become really complicated, but this sticks to basics which makes it fun to watch and easy to follow.That is why I give this anime 8/10 overall. For the anime newbie it is fantastic. It provides fun for 12 episodes and you will feel pleased that you watched it. However it isn't perfect, as the story is evidently very wayward (well it can be said there isn't a story in the first place. Just some girls becoming friends and then lots of subplots which really have no relation whatsoever) and that isn't really good enough for the hardcore Otaku. I can safely say though even after re watching it, there is still something about it you like.

How about something just to put in front of your face for awhile for background noise?Well you’re just in luck, it’s your generic high school comedy where these group of middle school girls are just entering high school. Better not expect anything out of the mundane while watching this cause you’ll be sorely misconstrue.If you’ve seen even one comedy anime you know precisely how this anime plays out already. The same old tropes with a mix of ecchi for good luck. The most creative Joshikousei: Girl's High gets is the pilot. Grimly it’s all the same pointlessness afterwards.Are...you looking for profound characters with any resemblance of character development? I think you get the picture here. Cause you better leave now cause this anime isn’t for you!When I stumbled upon Joshikousei: Girl's High I genuinely thought it was a 90’s anime, even when I first constructed this review. The reason being the lackluster art style that was dated even when it was first conceived. The animation is meager even for its time, all of it just being forgetful. I love old anime, especially anime from the 70’s and 80’s. Most anime from that time define what anime is today. But Joshikousei: Girl's High looks akin to an imitation of 90’s anime without the style. It just has aged so expeditious for a 2006 anime.Comedy is subjective and so is my feelings towards this anime’s funny moments. If you like in your face comedy and ecchi humor this is right up your alley. The comedy here is very of its time and feels like one went back to 2006. Same with the plot, it follows a group of girls and the antics of being in high school and get this, once again with a ecchi twist.There is absolutely no reason for anyone to watch this bland show. It’s the potato chip of anime, you keep consuming and it has zero nutritional value. Unless you’re like me and love empty, vacuous anime like Joshikousei: Girl's High. It’s a brainless comedy anime that has some random humorous bits every few episodes of high school girls getting into absurd situations. If your into that, go for it?I do not recommend this anime to anyone unless you seriously have nothing left to watch. you looking for profound characters with any resemblance of character development?

Even though it literally did not have an ending. The character development was ok and you actually grew to like all the quarky, far from perfect girls in this show.If you want a bit of ecchi and laughs and are not to worried about getting an epic story than this ones for you. ', 'What you see, is what you get...Joshikousei: Girl\'s High is what you really get when you get an Arms anime adaptation with an all girls cast in school with the typical ecchi hijinks that entails to it and LA could as EASILY have let this review out like that buuut might as well continue. Shall we?With Joshikousei: Girl\'s High being a very ""comedic hijinks"" anime well let\'s start there, well this is an Arms anime so right off the bat, the ecchi shows itself with the typical chest and boob shots and of course the anime uses this as comedy mostly in the main cast...in undress or ""costumes"" one way or another, again Arms anime. But for the most part the comedy revolves around the characters jabbing at one another...most of the time the comedy falling flat as the execution and buildup towards most of the""comedic hijinks"" are planned out that you can see it projected a mile away. So to this end, did LA even laugh ""at all"" in this anime...nope. Already falling behind huh -sigh-.The characters of Joshikousei: Girl\'s High have a bit of development to them and LA has at least two favourite characters, one out of default the other genuine. First is Eriko Takahashi voiced Hitomi Nabatame, the ditz of the group but has times of genius, she has her moments another words but generally is paired with Yuuichirou Odagiri voiced by Mitsuaki Madono her highschool homeroom teacher...who\'s also a narcissistic and is generally the buttmonkey outside of Eriko\'s group. Next is Akari Kouda voiced by Satsuki Yukino, the ""comedic one"" of the group, wanting to be actress one and has a fetish of wearing ""wacky costumes"" which becomes a running gag throughout the anime, Yuma Suzuki voiced by Masumi Asano is the usual tomboyish girl of the group and has beef with her little sister which does become one of the ONLY serious plotlines in the entire anime. Ikue Ogawa voiced by Sawa Ishige is the naive loli of the group and is generally a satellite character to our next character Kyoko Himeji voiced by Kyouko Hikami the most sane of the group and because of that she is one LA\'s more genuine favourite characters in the anime with Ayano Satou voiced by Mamiko Noto being the typical shy girl of the group but actually having a boyfriend with a LOONG name in which Ayano says it OFTEN as a running gag, she\'s also subjected to the buttmonkey status to the rets of the group thanks to her having a boyfriend as a result, guess why LA likes Ayano?...no not because of her glasses!?, she\'s the buttmonkey to the rest of the group of course and thus LA can feel sorry for her more or less. So overall the characters are slim pickings in terms of good characterization but what there is, the few episodes that dedicates itself to it\'s characters are minimal as Joshikousei: Girl\'s High seems to focus on comedy over it\'s characters in this regard.The animation done by Arms is...expected from them, even early on in the mid-2000\'s (this was made in 2006). Arms animation is rather basic, even with it\'s fanservice of all things, with bland typical character designs (sure school girls so), bland typical backgrounding with the only thing LA could give Arms some grace would be it\'s comical animation because you know, ""comedic ecchi anime"". Overall Arms\' animation was typical even in 2006, quality not withstanding because it WAS the mid-2000\'s (to counter this though, when this anime came out, animes like School rumble and Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu were out, soooooo)The voice cast was expected especially with the characters that were presented, LA WILL some grace at least as most of the voice actors did decently well with the characters they were given, especially from Kyouko Hikami as Himeji, Satsuki Yoshino as Kouda and Masumi Asano as Yuma and Mamiko Noto as Ayano. So decent voice cast overall, being a bit better in the animation department with what source material they were given after all.LA heard the author of Joshikousei: Girl\'s High, Towa Oshima being inspired by her own school experiences and with this anime, surely SOME of her experiences were exaggerated to a certain extent for comedy but LA can ""kinda"" get behind this statement mainly with the clique of the main cast, the fanservice parts and all...questionable at least.Joshikousei: Girl\'s High has it\'s MAJOR problems with it, namely the anime entirely focused on comedy over character thus leading to bland characterization towards most of the cast, ok production value from Arms namely the animation even in 2006 when it was released and the biggest complaint LA being the comedy is extremely predictable thus lost any chance of LA laughing even once as to how projected it is. But with it\'s flaws, Joshikousei: Girl\'s High has SOME good points namely what characters that have development, namely Yuma, Ayano and Himeji gives us the littlest bit of investment to them and the voice cast did ""ok"" and uhhh...that\'s it...hehe.Joshikousei: Girl\'s High is the best definition of an anime of ""What you see is what you get"" when your reading the synopsis of this anime, or a better statement would be...""exactly what it says on the tin"". Joshikousei: Girl\'s High is your typical ecchi all girls cast school anime you\'d see in the early to late 2000\'s anime you\'d see and from Arms no less, with the only ""claim to fame"" Joshikousei: Girl\'s High has gotten being that it\'s ED getting memetic to the point of it being parodied in other animes... in undress or ""costumes"" one way or another, again Arms anime.

It breaks the mold of the most popular, sought after, athletic, highly intelligent, student council president being the central character.

I guess since I am a guy, I wasn't able to relate to the characters, but it did give an insight to how a girl's life (in Japan) is like. There were scenes that made me laugh, and some made me cringe. Either way, I have a neutral opinion about this.Art: 7/10The art kinda reminded me of the 90's style of...Anime (which is my preferred art style) and it was okay. I didn't like the scenes of fanservice, but it was alright for the most part.Sound: 10/10The OP and ED of this Anime are very catchy tunes that are very enjoyable. In fact, the ED was a meme in Japan used for different animes a few years ago (Example would be Attack on Titan with the ED song). The instrumental version of the ED is also used in the opening scene of the episodes, and it was nice to hear the song at the beginning and end of the episodes. Either way, the sound was fitting for this anime, especially the silly music that would play in a silly moment.Character: 6/10The characters didn't really stand out to me, they were just 6 average high school girls who had their flaws, but had personality to each and every one of them.Enjoyment: 6/10I enjoyed about half of the things that were on here, but many scenes didn't really spark my interest. There are scenes that make you feel happy for the characters, and seeing how they all were united throughout the episodes gave a happy feeling to me. I guess it's just the message of friendship that made me happy.Overall: 6/10This anime isn't one that stands out, but it has it's pros and cons to go with it.

Even the name seems to be there to tell you ""no originality here."" It\'s the default slice of life product and honestly I didn\'t think I would enjoy it all that much. Did it live up to my expectations of mediocrity? Eh, kind of.There were some jokes near the beginning I thought were decently funny, as part of the setup and the character introductions. The running gag with the girl who gets into a relationship with *checks notes* Shimotakatani, was pretty funny. Perhaps it\'s my racist western outlook...but there\'s something just inherently comedic to me about a 6 or 7 syllable name being dropped whenever she has to address him. ""Oh Ayano,"" ""Oh Shimotakatani-kun."" When making fun of these scenes with my brother we\'d often just continue to add more syllables until we were saying ""Shimonotakanatakatani-kun"" or something. It was really the joke that kept us laughing through most of the rest of the show as it ran the gambit of high school anime tropes.The show veers a little into Asobi Asobase territory with it\'s outlandishness but I don\'t think any show will ever top the tone of that one, this one stays safely in trope territory for most of it\'s run with just those few exceptions. When those moments do come around it\'s all the more unexpected and adds to the comedy quite a bit. Like I mentioned above I think it\'s a show that\'d be a lot more fun to watch with some friends and just riff on it the whole time. 7/10 better than I expected. but there\'s something just inherently comedic to me about a 6 or 7 syllable name being dropped whenever she has to address him. ""Oh Ayano,"" ""Oh Shimotakatani-kun."" When making fun of these scenes with my brother we\'d often just continue to add more syllables until we were saying ""Shimonotakanatakatani-kun"" or something. It was really the joke that kept us laughing through most of the rest of the show as it ran the gambit of high school anime tropes.The show veers a little into Asobi Asobase territory with it\'s outlandishness but I don\'t think any show will ever top the tone of that one, this one stays safely in trope territory for most of it\'s run with just those few exceptions. When those moments do come around it\'s all the more unexpected and adds to the comedy quite a bit.

Although I'm a guy who has no idea what being a girl is like, I loved the humor, loved the characters and loved the setting. I remember almost tearing up while listening to the ending song of the last episode because I was sad that it was ending (Ed song is also one of my all time favourites) and I still haven't finished the manga till today because I don't want...to see it end.Maybe it's finally time to finish it for real.In the end the humor might not appeal to everyone but if it does hit you the right way, then you might fall in love with this anime as much as I have. to see it end.Maybe it's finally time to finish it for real.In the end the humor might not appeal to everyone but if it does hit you the right way, then you might fall in love with this anime as much as I have.""]"
Kage kara Mamoru!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/590/Kage_kara_Mamoru,"['This is a pretty decent anime. You have this boy ninja who has to protect his neighbor (a clumsy, childish, loving girl who he grew up with) because of this promise made by his family a long time ago. He first appears nerdy but when he has to fulfill his duty he turns into this nice looking serious ninja. The story pretty much revolves around his duty to protect his childhood friend/neighbor. Throughout this process, they (main character and other characters) face new challenges, meet new friends, and feelings grow.

This anime gets a 9.', ""NOTE: I wrote this review quite some time ago, and it doesn't meet my current standards, however since there are no other reviews here, it may be somewhat informative.-------------------------------------Story: Nerd-glasses wearing student one second, handsome &amp; mysterious ninja the next, Mamoru comes from a family of ninjas. Their purpose is to secretly protect the Konnyaku family, whom they have always lived next door to. Mamoru's particular mission is to protect the daughter, Yuna, and he has done so since he was small. This is made more difficult thanks to Yuna being a clumsy airhead who always manages to land herself into far-more-than-your-average amount of trouble....They are good friends (She has not yet mentioned that she loves him), and always go places together, which helps greatly with being nearby to protect her.Also, a number of female warriors appear, all of whom become enamoured with Mamoru(the ninja), and they begin fighting each other for him.Summary: A moderately paced series that follows Mamoru as he tries to protect Yuna without her knowledge, and defend himself from assassins, not to mention his parent's training, while the female warriors fight over Mamoru in the background.My Thoughts: Now, I've seen a few clumsy, idiotic anime characters in my time, but I think that Yuna takes the cake, then trips and falls into it, and promptly falls asleep, leaving mamoru to drag her away so she doesn't suffocate. I can't remember ever seeing a character so consistantly air-headed and clumsy, and there is a fair bit of variety to the situations she gets herself into. It's probably worth a look just for that fact.Apart from Yuna herself, there is a lot of funny stuff going on, such as ninja dogs and ninja rabbits.There's not a lot of combat, but what's there is stylish, and often humerous.Music: The opening/closing themes(Japanese) are nice, upbeat, and might get stuck in your head for a bit, but probably not worth putting in the collection.In closing: A good, but short, series, worth watching more for the comedy than the combat. I give it a thumbs up. I recommend it to anyone that likes idiotic anime characters or funny ninjas.

Koharu Biyori,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3085/Koharu_Biyori,"[""Whenever I watch a series like Koharu Biyori, I always find myself a little bit disturbed by the repeated themes of robot girls and maids.  I wonder is this what Japanese or men in general really want from their women?  A servant with ridiculous body measurements who will call them master?  Despite this initial reaction and a fairly uninspired opening episode, this series turned out to be a lot better than I was expecting.There isn’t a really overall plot to Koharu as its three episodes basically break down to a series of shorts within each episode.  Takaya is your standard anime...otaku who in this near future world goes to a shop called Maid Works where one can find various types of slave robots.  He ends up settling for a maid robot he names Yui.  Yui just wants to be a normal maid but Takaya wants to constantly dress her up in various outfits he has made.  From here we get introduced to the rest of our harem, consisting of some real girls and loli's and other maid robots.  Most of the first half of the OVA is dominated by the constant exposure of massive breasts and other echiiness.  Some genuine comedy is present and I couldn’t help myself from laughing from most of it.Yui and Takaya are fairly interesting despite their lack of any real substance.  Despite both being extremely stereotypical of the otaku guy and super moe maid.  Like the mains the supporting characters lack depth but were still fun.  The show probably would have been better off without a few of them as the cast got a little large towards the end for a series of this length.The characters are all very cute as would be expected.  The breast sizes are a bit silly as was the played lets dress a huge boobed girl in skimpy clothes and hang a cowbell around her neck.  Yes we get it, her boobs are big.. milk.  Seriously is that all you guys think about?  Acting is pretty solid however the show suffers from one the absolutely worst opening songs I have heard.  Off key much?If you are a lover of echii humor and boobs then this is a series you should check out.  Those who don’t like these themes will probably want to stay away.

Konpeki no Kantai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6229/Konpeki_no_Kantai,"[""The reason why I’m writing this review of an ultra-obscure OVA that’s more than 20 years old now is because it is at long last being subbed (more info on that at the series subforum).For those who are unfamiliar with KNK I'll just say it's an epic 32 episodes (each one 45 min on average) OVA that run from 1993 to 2003.

I guess the fact that I've watched the series several times Raw with my broken japanese should give you an indication of just how good the action scenes are.I’m not even a history or military buff but I sure as hell am a hardcore handrawn animation fan who loves a good, gripping story and interesting characters.

Reading the synopsis you get that shes a bit of a ditz but her responses to the situation at hand just feel so different than anything i have ever really seen before.The humor in this is done differently that i expected and i am really excited too see more of this 3 minute show. It may be only long enough for 1 joke but thats all i really need for this show. Anyone who likes pervy humor will enjoy this quite a bit i think. It feels really fresh compared...to most of whats out there right now.The humor and situations don't come off as aggressively while it maintains a kind of sweet atmosphere.The first thing i noticed about the art style is asuka's face. Its done very differently that most anime and it looks a little off in a way but it comes out as adorable in the end. Other characters are done fairly simple and not all that well defined and some extras are done comically for just added humor. The Audio is good nothing too special but asuka's voices is pretty sweet sounding.Overall i think this 3 minute show is a 8 from my first impression and i really look forward to more. If the show starts to let me down i will edit my review to reflect my current opinion but i already know this is gonna be just great for 3minutes. What makes shows like this is the delivery of the humor and i think they execute it well from just this small example. to most of whats out there right now.The humor and situations don't come off as aggressively while it maintains a kind of sweet atmosphere.The first thing i noticed about the art style is asuka's face. Its done very differently that most anime and it looks a little off in a way but it comes out as adorable in the end. Other characters are done fairly simple and not all that well defined and some extras are done comically for just added humor.

It also has its ecchi moments but I guess that helps with the situations atmosphere.Kyou no Asuka show is an anime I recommend if you wanna have a good time =)Overall: 6.5 thing (it gets the job done)The sound feels almost in-existent (what do you expect from a 3mins episode) the only thing that stood out for me in this section is the catchy ending, all things aside from this are really decent.The thing that amuses me from this anime and keeps it fresh is the variety of situations the main protagonist puts herself in, she also has the particular reasoning that makes this anime super enjoyable.

The main plot point is that these two can look exactly like Masamune's mother which causes for Masamune confusion and for the viewers, or at least it should cause fun.The second part revolves around our girls + trap cast going to a sea vacation together.Sea? Yeah, that's right, your girls will be in swimsuits, enjoy.The third part revolves around Yoshino....Yoshino's older sister makes an appearance as she dresses Yoshino in her clothes, which cause little fanservice scenes. The third part has Yoshino's character developing a little when she reminded of past's memories.To summarize:The first part is a totally comedic episode.The second has fanservice and romance.The third has a focus on one character.The character designs are the same, aren't made for animation but for pretty art.Don't expect good storyboard or character acting.The soundtrack is barely noticeable, the opening and the ending recite on this episode which was a bit nostalgic.I recommend it only for the fans of the series. If you weren't a fan of the 12 episodes tv series then you should stay away from this side stories, they don't have a change from the original series.Thanks for reading, hope it helps you.

Mokei Senshi Gunpla Builders Beginning G,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9040/Mokei_Senshi_Gunpla_Builders_Beginning_G,"[""Commercials aren't usually much fun to watch. Actually, most people see them as a chore if they really have to sit through them, or a bathroom break if they don't. Occasionally one comes across a particularly funny one, but the memory of those few seconds rarely remain. Even so, this works out for advertising purposes. If one sees enough advertisements for the same brand or product, it is hard not to have a name associated with a product stuck in permanent memory. Anime like Mobile Suit Gundam have made a business by producing cartoons essentially created to sell products, toys in this case. However, before...Mokei Senshi Gunpla Builders Beginning G (from here on referred to as Gunpla Builders), they had not made such a blatant push for a specific line of products in a full-length cartoon form.Gunpla Builders is surprising in how enjoyable it really is, despite its nature and simplicity. At this point, fans of Gundam as a franchise have certain expectations when it comes to the plot points and quality of the story of their favorite series. At only three episodes, and only about forty minutes at that, there is not much time to develop the sort of extensive narrative Gundam typically portrays; however, one of the strengths of Gunpla Builders is that it is aware of its own essence. A young boy finds a new skill, meets new people, experiences new things, and eventually comes to become his own person through his adventures. While this is the plot of an innumerable amount of other cartoons (particularly Gundam as a whole), Gunpla Builders does not feel like a chore to watch like the rest do because it is so short. In forty minutes the viewer is given what other cartoons take anywhere from twelve to hundreds of episodes to accomplish. In addition, the ridiculousness of the mechanics of the show, such as the arcade game they play, are easily overlooked because Gunpla Builders never takes itself too seriously. The only serious complaint here is that, for a show about building models of robots, there was very little time given to the actual building and not much information given about how the process works. The occasional bone is thrown, such as showing different types of parts or how to paint the models, but it wasn't quite as thorough as one would hope from a show specifically made about models.On the other hand, despite the simple story, the animation in Gunpla Builders was very nice. The action scenes are quite fluid, giving the arcade game battles the same feel as one would have from a typical Gundam show, which is definitely appreciated for a glorified commercial such as this. During battles, action is constantly happening in the background, and even the shorter or less important skirmishes provide plenty of interesting and fun to watch material, on top of being well-animated. The theme of custom models was clearly given thought to in the battles, as non-traditional, especially creative mobile suit designs fly around constantly during every scene. Despite this, the connection to the usual Gundam universes is provided through the various battlegrounds seen in the show. The viewer is treated to a quick and dirty pass at the progression of any given Gundam series through Gunpla Builders' steps through very familiar environments, one after the other, in a similar order that one would expect from the series. The score has a similar nostalgic feeling; though it isn't quite as strong as the visuals, it is clear effort was put into making Gunpla Builders feel as natural as possible.There's not much to dislike about Gunpla Builders. It is, in essence, a more honest form of advertising, but it is also so much fun to watch that one can't help but forgive it for its intentions.

Which is a nice touch and helps to keep the series from becoming bland!...And I do have to give kudos to the somewhat twist on the original concept that it brings to the table.The episodes don't really end on any cliffhangers, but Nanaka and the gang always seem to be doing something different in each episode. And as you would expect, Nanaka and Neji grow closer and change as the story progresses. It must be said though, that the ending to this series is just horrible! As nothing is resolved in the end, but getting there is quite entertaining!Art: 5/10The art style and characters are where this series really suffer from. Every character in this title just seem to scream out generic and bland, it almost brings to mind of a new company in Japan that has just started making anime. Because all the differences the charters did have, seemed to be nothing more than the obvious ways of making them look different. Oh and the backgrounds.....so boring!Sound: 6/10The soundtrack to this series has its charm, the opening and closing theme are well done and fit the style and atmosphere to this title, though I doubt anyone will be rushing to upload it to their ipods. The voice acting too isn't that bad, while nobody ever comes off as anything more than ordinary and seem to lack veriety in the personality department, at least to ever stand out as such, they also won't annoy either. Which is always a good thing!Characters: 5/10They are not bad, but some of their personalities may annoy some people. Six year old Nanaka, while cute and all, may start tobug you as you make your way through the series. Nenji is so lacking in the personality department, what with his more quiet nature, that he comes out more as boring than anything else. And 17 year old Nanaka? You will most likely just hate her! (she tends to be rude and want things her way) In my opinion, Amemiya is probably the most likable of the bunch, while she secretly likes Nenji, she usually puts that feeling aside in order to help both of them keep Nanaka's situation a secret from others. Nothing bad by any means, but nothing real special either.Bottom Line: 6/10Now despite everything I said about the characters, the anime itself is quite enjoyable and fun for a spin or two. Overall, the positives out way the negatives. If you are looking for an anime with a slight twist on a tried and true formula, then Nanaka 6/17 is worth giving a chance to!

I had run out of anime to watch and felt like starting on some new ones. Thankfully, Nanaka 6/17 turned out to be a fine little anime for me to watch before school started for me.So basically it's about two kids who grow apart upon entering high school. Nanaka's the studious girl and Nenji's the delinquent. Then, they get into an argument and Nanaka gets a brain injury which causes her to suffer from 'Backwards Aging Syndrome' as I call it. She's turned...back into her 6 year old self and Nenji has to babysit her. Simple enough, right?Yes, this is a very simple story. Nothing complicated, nothing totally bland. Just simple and easy to understand, though it does go into a strange direction in the end, but it's not anything bad. I liked how it was executed.The animation is, like the story, simple. It's not trying to be extravagant, which is good because sometimes I see that backgrounds tend to be a tad exaggerated in anime. But unlike the story, the animation tends to get a little bland at certain points. It's nothing special, but nice enough. The soundtrack too. It's not mind-blowingly awesome, nor is it bad. It just doesn't really stand out.The characters are what made the show for me. You'll be surprised by the changes that the main character, Nenji, goes through in order to reconcile with Nanaka and rekindle his old relationship with her. He does start out rather bland, but his development throughout the show is just amazing. He knows that he can't walk away from certain responsibilities or else his reputation might kick the bucket. Nanaka's got nice development too. She starts out as a stony-faced girl who can't think of anything better to do than study study study and not care about others. Thankfully she grows into a better person, even with her age regression, by the end of the show. The pink-haired girl, Yuriko, is definitely a change from the usual 'other girl likes the main guy who the main girl falls in love with' in most anime. Instead of being jealous and raving, she's calm and considerate and knows that although she likes Nenji and used to dislike Nanaka a little at first, she knows she can't force herself on Nenji and that Nanaka's a person who also deserves a little bit of happiness.Of course, while there are good things about this show, there are also bad things about it. The biggest flaw of this show? I feel it's the way they make little kids TOO mature sometimes. I mean, what little 5-6 year old girl would know the meaning of the words reference and reasonable and relationship? And what little kid would want to wish to be a housewife at such a young age!? That makes absolutely NO sense at all (unless it took place in the 19th century, but that's a different matter entirely)! Little kids should be little kids and play around with dolls and toys, not do housework and hook up with a high school guy! Good thing this show didn't pull a Kodomo no Jikan. Ugh. I'd hate to see this go into that direction.Well, even with its flaws, Nanaka 6/17 is a nice little show about childhood, nostalgia, growing up, and learning lessons in life. It's not mind blowingly awesome, but it's not bad either, and that's fine with me. But don't expect it's portrayal of little kids to be entirely realistic. back into her 6 year old self and Nenji has to babysit her. Simple enough, right?Yes, this is a very simple story.

Decent story with elements to be something great but masked behind annoying, flat characters. ', ""This is a very odd show. Nanaka is a complete bitch as a 17-year-old, and yet as a little kid, she is so troublesome and odd little girl. Nenji is no better, being high strong and easy to get into fights. The story is rather cute even if it’s annoying in some places. At first, I thought it would be a real magical girl show but it seems that I was so wrong. The only thing magical girl about this show is the odd pieces every once in a while when they have a Magical Domiko pieces. I get why they have that breaking the...episode, but it doesn’t make it any less annoying.So I have noticed in most animes (Also in many TV shows, movies, books, ext.), bump on the head results into amnesia and not complete and utter brain damage like real life. It seems there is no such thing as bad things that happen to anime characters. Just once, I want to see someone actually get hurt instead of this amnesia thing.The animation is lack luster and sometimes even seems haphazard at best. Having said that, it feels more like a child’s show and I guess that makes it alright. The colors and animation have that childish quality that fits with the story. A lot of times we get into the mind space of Nanaka and have these strange thought bubbles that really feel creepy. I’m happy that for the most part, there is not much of a fan service vibe from it even though if there was, it would have one of every style for the fans.Oh dear god my ears… Nanaka’s 6-year-old voice actor in the American version is so high-pitched that it’s really really hard for me to get into this. And sadly it’s part of the whole story pretty much. She is good with teen Nanaka but really, she should not be doing the little kid. And the Ay yaya thing she does is rather annoying because she does it way to often. You cannot go 5 minutes without her saying that! The voice of Satsuki Arashiyama is bad as well. I cringed a bit at how she sounded like someone who smoked a bit too much. Jinpachi, her brother isn't much better. episode, but it doesn’t make it any less annoying.So I have noticed in most animes (Also in many TV shows, movies, books, ext.), bump on the head results into amnesia and not complete and utter brain damage like real life.

And BOY am I glad I did. This was the best anime I've seen last year. And here's why.Story:The show is about 2 friends. Nanaka and Nenji. Both have glaring flaws. Nanaka is a study obsessed girl which causes herself to alienate everyone around her. Giving everyone a bad view on her. Nenji is a delinquent who always gets himself into fights with others. But after a heated argument, Nanaka falls into a coma,...and wakes up as her 6 year old self, trapped in her teenage body. This causes Nenji to change his ways, and to help Nanaka get through life in the state she's in. Now, while it has a familiar premise, the way it's told and the themes it has are done really well. Making it stand out. The best thing I loved about the story was the fact I could identify with it's messages about growing up. And I was at a time where school was beginning to overwhelm me as well as the future. The ending is bittersweet, but still very satisfying.Art:J.C. Staff's animation style varies in many of there shows. It goes from simplistic to very detailed. Nanaka 6/17's animation is on par with Azumanga Daioh. As in it has a really cute simplicity to it. While the character designs are familiar looking, they're still fun to look at.Sound:I've only seen this dubbed, because it's my preference. I have to say, they did a good job with it. I really liked that 2 of my favorite voice actors, Monica Rial, and Chris Patton voice the two lead roles. All the other voices are regulars you're use to hearing, and you will like there work here. The music goes from cute and adorable, to slow and relaxing. While it's not really the best I've heard in anime, it's still very good.Characters:The highlight of the show. I really loved this cast of characters. Both Nanaka's do represent 2 sides of us. The 17 year old side represents that side of me where I could get so obsessed with either my hobbies, or school, to a point where I alienate myself from others. However, as the series goes on, you do understand the reasons why she went into that state. The 6 year old side represents that little kid in us that's still there. Let's face it, we do have childhood favorites we like seeing every now and then. And of course there's that side that either cannot wait to grow up, or is just scarred to. So, 17 Nanaka's a bit of a bitch, but the 6 Nanaka's a lot more fun. Nenji was my favorite character, mainly because he was the one I connected with the most. I do feel his pain whenever he feels bad about acting mean and rotten, and then tries his best to improve. Or how he feels alone now that Nanaka's pretty much forgotten about him, and never has time to be with him. Trust me, I know how that feels. There are other characters like Amemiya, her friends, and Jinpachi where you may not like them at first, but as the shows goes on, they do warm up on you. Kuriko was a character that I could've hated, but I do understand why she likes to be with Nenji and her rivalry with Nanaka is just cute and hilarious. Nanaka's dad was just a riot with his over worrying and affection towards her daughter. You may dislike some of them at first, but they'll win your heart in a beat.Enjoyment and Overall:Nanaka 6/17 is a underrated gem in my opinion. An anime that's overlooked, but has a lot to offer with it's smart story, and lovable and relatable characters. If you haven't seen this series, consider it.

Anime, in general, is so monotonous, gimmicky, and tropey. I\'ve been aware of this for years now. However, something about Nanaka 6/17 really got under my skin. I think it just caught me at a bad time. I\'m a little burnout on anime, at the moment. The show isn\'t doing anything different from your ordinary, run-of-the-mill anime. No, it\'s just that it\'s so blatant and lacks any kind of subtlety in it\'s writing, that it made...me legitimately angry. Okay, okay. Angry is a bit of an overstatement. I\'m just tired and fed up. It\'s almost as if they had a checklist of every generic anime cliché they wanted to do. A dime a dozen, you\'re probably thinking. Many anime do that. The difference here is that they rub that checklist in your face. It\'s covered in drool and doodled with crayon. That\'s the aura I\'m getting from this show. I only watched this out of curiosity and got through a third of it.Nanaka 6/17 is about this girl named Nanaka Kirisato, a seventeen year old high school student. Her age will be important in a second. Nanaka had a bit of a whoopsy poopsy slip \'n fall after getting into a heated argument with her friend, Nenji Negihara. Who looks very similar to Itou from ""Kyou Kara Ore Wa"" look it up. The accident caused her brain to regress back into a six year old. Which is in the title! Get it!? Nanaka 6/17! Hahahahahhahahahahaha. So hysterical I\'m laughing my pussy off. You can imagine many of the awkward scenarios coming out of a premise like this. Nenji trying his best to keep his now mentally regressed friend out of trouble. It gets very annoying at times.This show loves putting it\'s stupid, unfunny gimmick in your face constantly that it starts to become very irritating to watch. To give the show some credit, it\'s the only gimmick it has. Which is pretty frustrating, considering it\'s not that strong of a shtick to begin with.SHE\'S SEVENTEEN BUT HAS THE MIND OF A SIX YEAR OLD! ISN\'T THAT WACKY!? PLEASE LAUGH! WE\'RE BEGGING YOU!I bet that caught your attention after skimming the review. LolOne noteworthy thing I will quickly mention is that episode four is point where Nanaka 6/17 becomes interesting. There\'s another character I didn\'t mention named, Yuriko Amemiya. Up until this point, Nenji has kept Nanaka\'s condition a secret, especially at school. Yuriko is the first to learn about Nanaka\'s secret. She\'s also in love with Nenji, but since Nenji and Nanaka are always together, she ends up getting jealous of Nanaka. So for the first three episodes, Yuriko is jealous of six year old. Thinking about that fact is slightly funny to me. Episode four was by far the best episode I watched. However, I just can\'t bring myself to care. It wasn\'t even that strong of an episode. It was just mildly intriguing for a few minutes, and that was it. I couldn\'t muster up the strength to continue. Who knows, maybe it improves dramatically after episode four. Probably not. I don\'t care. You shouldn\'t care.

Mushi-Uta,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2603/Mushi-Uta,"[""Mushi-Uta Review.Writen by: ErisuSince someone else made a very negative review about this series, I decided to give you another look on the situation.StoryMushi-uta's story takes place in the near future. Ten years before the story's opening, strange insect-like creatures known as &quot;Mushi&quot; began appearing. The Mushi are able to consume peoples' dreams and thoughts in return for supernatural powers. At the end of episode one, protagonist Daisuke &quot;Kakkou&quot; Kusuriya encounters a young girl named Shiika Anmoto. The two, in time, become quite close. However, unbeknownst to Kakkou, Shiika is an escapee from a secret prison known as GARDEN where those posessed by the Mushi,...known as the Mushitsuki are held. GARDEN's military force, the Special Environmental Conservation Executive Office, dispatches its finest killer to track down Shiika. However, they are faced with resistance from the Mushibane resistance organisation, led by the secretive &quot;Ladybird&quot;.(ANN)First, Mushi-uta didn't attract me at all, since I really hate bugs. But this is so much more than only bugs! The Story resembles around the normal high-school boy, Daisuke Kusuriya. He is, in reality, known as ''Kakkou'', who works for an orginization that kills other people's ''Mushi''. He meets both Shiika and Rina, Rina also known as ''Ladybird'' is the leader from the resistance against the orginazation where Daisuke works for. Shiika has a very rare Mushi, so she's known as ''Fuyuhotaru''. She is the only one who escapted from GARDEN after her Mushi got killed by Kakkou (Daisuke). After watching some episodes, I really got addicted to Mushi-Uta. While watching it, I had a good feeling about this series and that turned out to be right. This has alot of tragedy but it's really worth watching.ArtI don't have objections about the animation. The characterdesigns are well done and I didn't saw alot of mistakes. I think it's very nice made and wouldn't want it any other way.SoundWell, let's start with the opening and ending music.The name of the opening song is ''Mushi-Uta'' (how original) sung by Akatsuki, which was a very good song. I didn't mind hearing it every episode at all.Then, the ending song, ''Sayonara'', sung by Hiromi Sato was really a big +! I loved it and even now I can't get enough of it.When the moment for some background-music came, they gave it to us and I've also heard enough sound-effects to make this come out to a 9.CharacterThe good thing about this is, that you won't only get to know the main characters. I also learned some things about the supporting characters, so you'll also get to know them! I really loved everyone in Mushi-Uta except Kakkou's boss.I loved Daisuke very much, because how he looks on the outside turns out to be very, very different from the inside! He was kinda mysterious but did seem to have a soft spot for Shiika. It also looks like ''Daisuke'' and ''Kakkou'' are two different persons, if you didn't knew that Daisuke was Kakkou, I don't know if I would've known that they are the same person. He's different from the usual male lead's, so I really liked him.Than, Shiika, my personal favourite character. Even though she might look like the normal ''sweet'', ''shy'' girl, for me, she was different. I liked having a girl like her who doesn't seem to hurt anyone have such a great power as she has. Without her, it wouldn't be the same!Last, Rina, who's in the same class as Daisuke. Think everyone of us will know her type of person, the big-mouthed girl at school, and yes, outside the school, she's ''Ladybird''. Ladybird is the leader of the resistance who falls in love with Daisuke! As I said, she falls in love with Daisuke without knowing that he's Kakkou, her enemy. I also loved her personality and how she tries to do the best thing. Even though Daisuke does not seem to love her, he really did like her.So... here's the thing! Mushi-Uta's characters for the win! XDEnjoyment10! Yeah, I really enjoyed everything of this. No episode bored me even through you must watch until the end if you want to understand everything. The plot might seem a bit confusing, but the confusing thing might end up being Mushi-Uta's charm, as for me.OverallAnyway, overall, this anime wins! It will remain as one of my favourite animes ever and I can't wait for season two (yes, there's going to be a season two!). I hope that you guys will give it a chance and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did!-Erisu- known as the Mushitsuki are held.

However, they are faced with resistance from the Mushibane resistance organisation, led by the secretive &quot;Ladybird&quot;.(ANN)First, Mushi-uta didn't attract me at all, since I really hate bugs. But this is so much more than only bugs! The Story resembles around the normal high-school boy, Daisuke Kusuriya. He is, in reality, known as ''Kakkou'', who works for an orginization that kills other people's ''Mushi''. He meets both Shiika and Rina, Rina also known as ''Ladybird'' is the leader from the resistance against the orginazation where Daisuke works for. Shiika has a very rare Mushi, so she's known as ''Fuyuhotaru''. She is the only one who escapted from GARDEN after her Mushi got killed by Kakkou (Daisuke). After watching some episodes, I really got addicted to Mushi-Uta. While watching it, I had a good feeling about this series and that turned out to be right. This has alot of tragedy but it's really worth watching.ArtI don't have objections about the animation. The characterdesigns are well done and I didn't saw alot of mistakes. I think it's very nice made and wouldn't want it any other way.SoundWell, let's start with the opening and ending music.The name of the opening song is ''Mushi-Uta'' (how original) sung by Akatsuki, which was a very good song. I didn't mind hearing it every episode at all.Then, the ending song, ''Sayonara'', sung by Hiromi Sato was really a big +! I loved it and even now I can't get enough of it.When the moment for some background-music came, they gave it to us and I've also heard enough sound-effects to make this come out to a 9.CharacterThe good thing about this is, that you won't only get to know the main characters. I also learned some things about the supporting characters, so you'll also get to know them! I really loved everyone in Mushi-Uta except Kakkou's boss.I loved Daisuke very much, because how he looks on the outside turns out to be very, very different from the inside! He was kinda mysterious but did seem to have a soft spot for Shiika. It also looks like ''Daisuke'' and ''Kakkou'' are two different persons, if you didn't knew that Daisuke was Kakkou, I don't know if I would've known that they are the same person. He's different from the usual male lead's, so I really liked him.Than, Shiika, my personal favourite character. Even though she might look like the normal ''sweet'', ''shy'' girl, for me, she was different. I liked having a girl like her who doesn't seem to hurt anyone have such a great power as she has. Without her, it wouldn't be the same!Last, Rina, who's in the same class as Daisuke. Think everyone of us will know her type of person, the big-mouthed girl at school, and yes, outside the school, she's ''Ladybird''. Ladybird is the leader of the resistance who falls in love with Daisuke! As I said, she falls in love with Daisuke without knowing that he's Kakkou, her enemy. I also loved her personality and how she tries to do the best thing. Even though Daisuke does not seem to love her, he really did like her.So... here's the thing! Mushi-Uta's characters for the win! XDEnjoyment10! Yeah, I really enjoyed everything of this. No episode bored me even through you must watch until the end if you want to understand everything. The plot might seem a bit confusing, but the confusing thing might end up being Mushi-Uta's charm, as for me.OverallAnyway, overall, this anime wins! It will remain as one of my favourite animes ever and I can't wait for season two (yes, there's going to be a season two!). I hope that you guys will give it a chance and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did!-Erisu-"", ""Before I start naming the 'buts', let me tell you what really intrigued me with Mushi Uta; the things that really had this series going for me.For one, the animation. It's a 12 episodes long show, which is really short considering the amount of storytelling needing to be done. However, unlike many 12 episodes having Anime's, the animation quality wasn't bad and in fact one of this Anime's strong points. Action scenes were worked out nicely, coloring was nice and fitting, the animation was smooth and the backgrounds and effects looked particularly interesting enough.Besides animation, the sounds are well done (though not exceptional) and the...whole concept lurking behind this Anime is extremely good. To be honest, without knowing anything about this Anime I had a peek into the first episode. I ended up finishing it and a curious mini me inside me was triggered into watching more and more. The idea itself was great, the characters seemed perfect and the concept seemed worth it. Worth time that is.More about the characters before I start ranting on and on about the concept. The visuals (designs) are, just like the animation, pretty good. It's not exceptional or really interesting; but it fits in with the story that's being told and therefore is pretty likeable. Especially likeable is the main character who seems like the perfect 'badass'. He wears goggles, is an assassin and besides that, is the strongest guy around! I mean, no more wimps as lead characters, finally a strong guy! At least, so I thought. However, let me get back to the concepts.The concept was great, the characters had potential. Then where did it go wrong? Wrong you say? Yes, because somewhere in time Mushi Uta lost my interest -and besides that- wrongfully used the potential I saw in it that much earlier.Let me clarify. For starters, the 'badass' main character was put into 'development', a forced development by that. The creators figured it was his time to develop; thus they made him develop. It was so wrong! All of a sudden Mr. Perfect Assassin turned into a wimp! It's cool and all if he starts getting emotions, but why did he turn weak again? Why did he get ill? And I'm not trying to spoil things here, but he really did turn weaker towards the middle/end. Which is a shame.Besides that, there is a love triangle going on which -in my honest opinion- isn't adding anything to the story. It's like making a mixture of coke light and coke. I mean, what's the point really?Of course the concept isn't consisting of just one character. But it's consisting of it's story and how the story develops (alongside it's characters).Things seemed rushed towards the middle/end. Even an unneeded addition of a love story was added. What the f, this is an action packed fantasy story, and you are adding a love triangle. Wake up call please? Besides that the story gained an uninteresting plot twist. The idea of bugs (where the story is about) turned chaotic and plain weird as the story progressed. Unnecessary scenes were inserted and more than once have I been tempted to just 'STOP' the player and start doing something that I do like.For that reason, just the feeling of wanting to 'STOP' something -despite being well animated- is more than enough reason for me to tell you to warn you.It's not that bad an Anime really, heck you might even like it. But for me, it's a 12 episodes long Anime that needed more episodes, a renewal of it's complete story and it seems like I wasted time watching 51 episodes of something unenjoyable while it's only 12 episodes long.To me, it's not worth more than a 6. But seeing how crappy some Anime I rated a 6 are, and seeing how it did have loads of potential (especially earlier episodes)... I'm giving it a 7.The genres are mostly action/drama, in a fantasy world setting.It's 12 episodes long. Most enjoyment I had with this was from it's first episode; after learning about it's concept. Least enjoyment I had with this Anime was probably in one of the middle episodes or ending episode. whole concept lurking behind this Anime is extremely good.

If you kill a host's insect, the host goes into an incurable comatose-like state called &quot;fallen&quot;.  News of a host who was able to recover from the &quot;fallen&quot; spreads, and two groups race to capture her to learn her secrets.It had the makings of an action-packed drama; unfortunately, it was presented quite poorly.  Most of the anime was focused on a love triangle that was only borderline interesting.  One of the characters that had the most screen time...was also the least interesting character in the whole show.  The love story didn't fit well with the action scenes.  The plot progression was confusing.If only they had explained the general basis for mushi in a more straightforward manner it would've been more enjoyable.  Instead, almost every important detail was left a mystery to be revealed in a future episode, which left me asking, &quot;huh?&quot; during most of the episodes.  Almost every 24-minute episode felt like an hour.  This series could've been so good had it been done right.Not recommended. was also the least interesting character in the whole show.

Almost every 24-minute episode felt like an hour.  This series could've been so good had it been done right.Not recommended."", 'Welp, when I first started watching this show, I was like, ""Oh cool! Bugs! That\'s awesome and original,"" but then, after watching past the second episode, I couldn\'t shake the impression that the bug aspect was really all this show had going for it. After finishing the show, I was sadly proven correct. But, let\'s break it down, shall we?**WARNING! There are some slight SPOILERS from this point onwards. I\'ll try not to reveal anything hugely important, but to express my viewpoint on some issues, giving away tiny details is necessary.**~Story~Okay, as has been pointed out by two of the other reviewers, the story is...incredibly confusing and convoluted. There are so many plot holes in it and unanswered questions that it\'s like falling down a trapdoor, hitting twenty some odd tree branches, and then proceeding into a large, black abyss of death and despair... Okay, so that might be a bit of an overreaction, but seriously, the story almost seems more like an afterthought than the purpose.Here\'s an example of one of the many problems: Right from the get go we know that the main character Kakkou has destroyed the Mushi of one of the other main characters, Shiika. We see this within the first five minutes of the first episode. This acts as an interesting lead into the series, and does get the viewers hooked as the setting is uncertain and the context is unclear. Who are Shiika and Kakkou? And why did Kakkou destroy Shiika\'s Mushi? Unfortunately, the entire story is revealed in its entirety to the viewer... in, I believe, episode three. So all the mystery surrounding the story setup is gone very early on.Also, we see that the two know each other, yet, when Kakkou and Shiika meet later in episode one or two, they somehow have no idea who the other person is. What? How does that make sense? We know that Kakkou remembers the girl from the opening, who looks EXACTLY the same as Shiika, yet, he has no clue the two are one and the same? Yes, Kakkou suffers from what I like to refer to as ""Sailor Moon Syndrome."" Oh, no! She\'s wearing a different outfit! I can\'t tell who this strange person I\'ve surely never met before is! Even though she\'s the only person in the whole anime and probably all of Japan who has that hair color and style! At least Shiika has an excuse as she suffers largely from amnesia... which is something we aren\'t told until practically the end of the series. Would have been nice to have know that sooner. Also, her amnesia seems to be highly selective as she can still remember her family and goes home in an attempt to find them. Sadly, they are gone. Where? No one knows and the subject is never revisited. Maybe they all moved to Tahiti.It just gets worse from there. Kakkou goes to school under the name Daisuke Kusuriya, allegedly to track down the head of the resistance, Ladybird. I could have sworn with the way that this was presented that they already knew who Ladybird was, otherwise, why else have Kakkou enroll in a specific school in a specific class? Yet, later on, it seems like they had no idea who Ladybird was.. or they just decided not to attack her. Why? Who the heck knows? Maybe they just knew that she was high school age and pulled the name of a high school out of a hat in the hopes that it would be the one she attends and happened to get lucky. Or they asked their magic eight ball for guidance. Yeah. That must be it.Also, the resistance in and of itself doesn\'t make sense. It\'s only made up of four people, two of which are small children. Now, they imply that it was marginally bigger at some point, but I\'m left thinking, ""If this is the biggest threat to the SEPB (Kakkou\'s organization), how sad are they?"" Further, Shiika manages to rescue everyone from a very dramatic situation, but we never actually get to see how. They\'re all stuck, with seemingly no hope, then bam! Next episode. Everyone\'s safe and happy thanks to Shiika. But do they show us how or even explain it? Nooooo. Really, it\'s just a huge tangle of a bunch of very vague ideas that are presented poorly and hastily.To be fair, the series starts off with interesting story elements, like the Mushi, but its lack of proper explanation overshadows any enjoyment to be had from them. I personally wanted to know more about Keji\'s past and situation, as its briefly touched upon (oddly inappropriately as he just starts blathering on about his past to Kakkou at one point for no apparent reason), but that is never fully explored either.~Art~The art was fine. Some shots during the action were a bit shoddy and they make Keji\'s chin oddly elongated at points, but it was pretty nice for the most part.~Sound~Eh, the opening theme was okay. It was a bit slower and dreamy with the stereotypical ""hope and love conquers all"" theme. I watched it once or twice, then skipped it for the rest of the series. The ending I suffered through once. It was also slow and meh. Better than the opening but without the intriguing animation to warrant me watching it. The sound effects were okay and the voice acting was pretty good. The screaming was especially well done, I\'ll grant that.~Conclusion~So, overall, I really didn\'t much care for the series. It really bored the heck outta me, to be honest, which is why I rated it so low. Even with all the story issues, it would have gotten a 5 out of me had the pacing not been so terrible. Even the action scenes were aggravating because they were constantly broken up with dramatic introspections and overly dramatic dialogue. I will give the ending some credit as it did some things that were unexpected, but for a series that placed so much emphasis on the ending, it failed to deliver. I found myself not caring about any of the characters aside from Keji and his assistant, and even then, I didn\'t grow too attached as they remained largely underdeveloped. If the show had been limited to 6 episodes and they\'d focused more on the plot and ironing out the story, it would have been decent, possibly even really good. Alas, it was not so. With how many great anime there are out there, I recommend not wasting your life and time on this one. incredibly confusing and convoluted.

Please be aware that I\'m writing the review after such long period of time, i had already forgotten some parts of it. I apologize if some parts aren\'t really clear.-= There are some spoilers included below=-For those who didn\'t know, this anime is an adaptation of its light novel counterpart. Which the entire series consisted of 11 volume + ongoing, and 8 volume of side story (Mushi Uta Bug).Well, this anime was fairly interesting to me at first. It...didn\'t stood out very much in terms of art and sound compare to other animes that were released during the time. But ya, i loved it. After seeing a bit of the storyline itself and how it toss these characters mercilessly, it totally hooked me up. I really liked the theories/set up of (Mushi) as well, where as these teenagers have to pay a portion of their dream for the cost of the (Mushi)\'s power, which supported the basic trade-off of power.Now lets get onto what the anime has to offer us:-Story-i gave a 8.The story itself wasn\'t bad. It followed almost 75% of the it\'s first volume light novel. It did include some useless/extra information that wasn\'t suppose be there. Things like the camera girl, who is Rina\'s friend and later became a mushitsuki? She was suppose to be a character from the 7th volume. And as for those people who came and hunt the girl down, ""C"" and that blonde hair cutie, they weren\'t suppose to come out as well. There were too many unnecessary things that they added in for the plot twist. Oh, they also took out many things that were important too, things like the conversation between Daisuke and his boss which would later connect to the 2nd volume.Well, that was how i felt after reading the light novel. They could\'ve done a better job on the anime if they followed the light novel\'s setting. But even so, it still did show a lot of its good point in a way.-Art-i gave a 8.The art could\'ve been better. They were kind of cheating on drawing the (Mushi) as well. For example, when those goggled people appeared in the park to ambush (Ladybird) and summoned their (Mushi)s, they all freaking look the same to me. Which was against the rule of Mushi uta, stating that each host has only one and only type of (Mushi). So if i have a dragonfly, you cant have the same dragonfly like me.However, i do like a few of their (Mushi) design. Like Kakkou\'s, Centi\'s, Kabuto, and MinMin\'s. I didn\'t like Rina\'s, because it looks ugly for some reason. Same goes for Shiika.As for character design, they were not bad but more detail would be nice. I really liked Shiika\'s smile, shes so cute. And one thing i disliked, is Kakkou\'s hair style, it looked fugly. Oh, i almost forgot the maturation stage. The way they drew for maturation was weird and ... don\'t look as good as the novel one.Those didn\'t even look like (Mushi) at all, merely aliens if you ask me.-Sound-i gave a 8.The opening sound was okay, i wouldnt mind listening to it every ep. The ending song was another story thought, really emotional and sad, totally fit the theme of mushi uta. As for those background music and all that, since i watched the series during 2007. i cant really remember how it was, but i think they were okay.-Character-i gave a 9.The voice acting of each character were great. Totally loved shiika\'s timid voice, i forgot who acted her role but ya. Not much to pick about regarding to the voice acting part.Almost all of the characters were acting directly from the light novel, so i guess it was okay.-Enjoyment-i gave a 9.Really enjoyed the series from the start to end. After reading the light novel counterpart, I fell more madly in love with the series. The light novel provided a lot of the details that the anime missed while the anime provided a lot of the scene that words cant describe.-Overall-i gave a 9.it was great, but could\'ve been better if they followed the light novel setting and exclude some of the unnecessary things.Extra information: Don\'t really expect they would do a 2nd season, since at the ending of ep 12. they gave it all away. By that i mean, the girl who came to visit Haji was his sister which was not suppose to meet him until the 2nd volume.And this is extra for those who would love to read the light novel. Currently, my group [C.E Light novel translation group] are working on the project of Mushi Uta. We are around 60% done with the first volume, and possible moving on to the 2nd volume and beyond. We are also planning on translating the Mushi Uta Bug series as well, the short story light novel of mushi uta. Just go google and find us =).

We are also planning on translating the Mushi Uta Bug series as well, the short story light novel of mushi uta. Just go google and find us =). Hope to gather more people~ and Please spread the Mushi uta love! It\'s a wonderful story if you given it enough time.', 'I was bored one day, browsing through Crunchyroll, and came across Mushi-Uta. After reading a quick synopsis of the series, I gave it a go. It was different than I expected. Completely different. Though, I mean that in a good way.It was certainly enjoyable, yet really the only downsides to it for me were the last episode, or should I say, last battle, and some missing plot devices that could have extended this show even further.Let\'s get to it, then.Story: 9I shouldn\'t exactly say that there\'s a story to this show... it\'s more like, an ongoing conflict between two groups of...people. One group is out to destroy the insects and create the fallen, while the other is out to save anyone who is a host to the insects. To find a place where they belong.The ""story"" of this series focuses strongly on the relationships between characters and how they grow during the situation that they\'ve been put into. So, there isn\'t exactly a main plot other than one of the character\'s goals that she is striving for. I guess you could say it\'s character driven?The basis of this show is certainly unique and quite interesting. The way the characters deal with these insects is intriguing. And while it is interesting, it just could not bring itself to it\'s full potential.There are some plot elements introduced that are just kind of... there. They\'re introduced and, that\'s really it. Nothing beyond them is explained or take action. Such as, the three main devourers. Only one is introduced and, what happens to her in the end is really hard to determine. Also, the ending comes along without telling us what happens to other characters, such as ones that have become fallen. Of course, the fates of the three main characters is shown but... no one else, really.Other than the aspects that were left out of the story or left unexplained, I don\'t really have much else to complain about. It\'s a solid series, and it really pulls you in throughout the entire show, especially if you\'re a fan of romance and the relationships between characters. I\'ll explain what I mean by that in the character section.Art: 7I have to be fair, this series is from 2007 so it doesn\'t have the best quality animation out there. Though, I do have to say, the soft coloring and art of the series is very appealing and fits the mood extremely well. The action scenes were alright for the most part, and the last episode does contain some bad CG... that doesn\'t matter much since, there isn\'t too much action to begin with. It does it\'s job. The animation is nice and smooth, too. There just wasn\'t much impact to the action scenes.Sound: 8I won\'t say much about this, but I will state that I loved the soundtrack. Although I loved it, I gave it an 8 because it doesn\'t use a wide variety of songs. It uses a nice mix of violin, piano and even some saxophone, which usually I don\'t care for but it seemed to fit nicely in this series. I do love me some violin and piano though.It certainly added to the emotion, though, as certain scenes felt more... magical, or enticing, because of the creative visuals and beautiful music.Character: 8If you\'ve ever seen Darker than Black or even Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom then the main character may seem familiar to you. In Darker than Black, Hei is an assassin who works undercover, though during the day, he\'s a normal college student. Though over time, due to certain events, he begins to grow actual feelings. In Phantom, Zwei is a normal teenager forced into the ways of an assassin, but slowly begins to break away and gain emotions after the encounters he\'s had with certain people. Kakkou, or should I say, Daisuke, is extremely similar to both of these. The only difference is, he isn\'t really an assassin... though he does go out on missions, using his skills to take down insects. And during the day, he\'s a normal school boy. Over time, like the other two characters mentioned, he starts to change his ways and views on things after encounters with certain people. After experiencing a somewhat normal life. He begins... to care for others.You can really notice how the characters grow in this series. Daisuke, Rina and Shiika, all change in some way or another. I only gave it an 8 because, well, they could have been developed even further and, at times their personality seemed sort of... bland. They\'re all experiencing some kind of depression, some kind of worry... though they\'re all determined. It\'s a nice cast of characters. Fairly small but, watching their relationships grow is certainly entertaining. Plus, don\'t you love shows where enemies (Rina is trying to save hosts while Daisuke takes them down) go to school together without knowing they are who they are, and end up getting close to one another? I won\'t say anymore. You\'d have to see for yourself. It\'s really interesting, I swear!Enjoyment: 9I felt really attracted to this series... it had an overall... melancholic feeling to it, and I really enjoying characters like Daisuke and Rina. Other than the final battles which, I didn\'t really care for, this series kept me wanting more. I\'m glad I found it... but I only wish that it was longer. Oh well...Thank you for reading!

Now, time for me to look through some of that soundtrack...', 'Rarely does an anime make me want to write a review for it but this one did... which speaks something about it I guess.First, I have to admit Mushi-Uta is something I watched on  whim while stumbling upon it while looking for something else. So needless to say once the bugs came rolling in I had my doubts. However, I quickly found myself getting over the bugs and saw a surprisingly good anime. The Story revolves around the high-school boy Daisuke Kusuriya. But he also has another identity as \'\'Kakkou\'\', the top agent working for an organization that hunts those possessed by ""Mushi"" and...either captures them, if they cooperate, or kills their Mushi thus making them into fallen. Early on he meets both Shiika and Rina, Rina who is also known as \'\'Ladybird\'\' is the leader from the resistance against the organization where Daisuke works for. Shiika, also known as \'\'Fuyuhotaru\'\', on the other hand has a very rare and powerful Mushi and is the only person who escapted from GARDEN after her Mushi got killed by Kakkou (Daisuke) 13 years previous. After watching the first two episodes, I really got into Mushi-Uta\'s story. The more I watched it the more I wanted to see how everything played out. Forewarning though, this has a lot of tragedy but it\'s really worth watching.Art: 8I don\'t really have objections about the animation. The character designs are well done and I genuinely liked them. Considering this is only a 12 episode anime the animation was very good and I didn\'t see a lot of mistakes. Despite being a few years old now once into the story you\'ll find you don\'t really mind.Sound: 8First let me say I gave it an 8 not because it was bad so much as in the end nothing particularly wowed me.-The name of the opening song is \'\'Mushi-Uta\'\' (very original right?) sung by Akatsuki, which though not one I would say if a favorite was a good enough song that I didn\'t mind hearing it every episode.-Then, the ending song, \'\'Sayonara\'\' (again so original), sung by Hiromi Sato was like the OP good but not ""wow that\'s good"" good. As for the rest when the moment called for some background-music, it came. The sound effects were great not the best but everything sounded as it should. In the end I settled for an 8 but could have probably given it a 9 if the songs were just a little more memorable.Character: 9What I really enjoyed about the characters is that not only do you get to know the main characters but you\'ll also catch glimpses about some of the supporting characters. Just enough to make them more significant and add to the story without bloating the story. I loved most of the characters Mushi-Uta except for a few like Kakkou\'s boss who I still couldn\'t get a real sense of wheither he was good, bad, or what.-I loved Daisuke , because of his dual persona. On one hand the almost the very definition of a mysterious stoic warrior \'\'Kakkou\'\' and on the other the clumsy forgettable (but lovable) ordinary high-school student \'\'Daisuke\'\'. Looking at him from the warrior side he is very, very different from what he really is. He was kinda mysterious but did seem to have an unusual soft spot for Shiika almost getting himself killed just to met her after first laying eyes on her. In the end I think I\'ll remember him most of all as he\'s different from the usual male lead\'s, so I really liked him.-I liked Shiika even though I am not sure why. Though I wouldn\'t say she was a particularly stand out character, I think her character was necessary and was exactly what the part called for.-Lastly, Rina, my favorite character along with Kakkou. In the same class as Daisuke, she isn\'t a particularly original character type but that\'s not to say you wont like her any less. At school she is more of the tsundere type. Not annoyingly almost bi-polarly so but more of a realistic sweet and shy young schoolgirl kind. Outside the school she\'s \'\'Ladybird\'\' the leader of the resistance and while puts up a strong front has emotional cracks that as the story progresses become bigger. And whether inside school or out she always tried to do whats best even if she knows it\'ll hurt her. In the end, without ruining it, she makes you cheer for her and when they don\'t you\'ll really feel for her.Enjoyment: 8So like I said I really enjoyed this title. No episode really bored me and to fully grasp everything you must watch until which isn\'t so bad as it keeps you hooked as you wait for answers. The plot was a bit confusing at times as it never fully explained everything but as it is only 12 episodes you\'ll forgive it and there is enough to get by. More annoying is how it introduces some characters and you think they\'ll play a more pivotal role by the way they are shown but in the end they are tossed aside. Not to mention the ending which I hated so much it almost killed the whole anime for me. It wasn\'t that it was bad so much as I just personally hated it and if your anything like me it\'ll just tick you off too.Overall: 7Overall, this anime anime was a good one and worth watching for only 12 episodes but due to it\'s ending not one I will watch again as it would just sour the whole thing for me. Supposedly there is going to be a second season which will probably solve a lot of the plot issues stated above and I probably will still watch it... though I still might not be able to due to this season\'s ending.In the end I am giving it a 7 only because of the ending but otherwise an 8 maybe maybe 9 since it would be an 8.5 were it available.-Firefox either captures them, if they cooperate, or kills their Mushi thus making them into fallen.

Otherwise, the story is convoluted and rushed; and the characterization is harried, if not completely superficial. I, for one, actually really liked the way this series looks: the protagonist (Kakkō) resembles Ken in his Digimon Emperor garb from Digimon 02 and the mushi (“Originals”) designs in the finale are VERY reminiscent of Go Nagai’s Devilman. I tend to gravitate towards fringe or “cult” series, because I think that watching everything that’s acclaimed, all the time, is boring―but, there are many times in series like this, where, potential for something out-of-the-ordinary...is flushed, like a spider down a drain. See Sci-Fi Harry for a prime example of this.•\tThe characters are practically cardboard cutouts, save for Rina, who is only a one-note character, herself, but still manages to have more of a personality. The main female character (Shīka) seems like she might be interesting, at first, but her characteristics don’t get fleshed out, so you’re just left with “shy” and “submissive.” Her voice actress is Kana Hanazawa, but it’s hard to tell because her vocal work in this series sounds amateurish―I don’t know if this is the fault of it being one of Hanazawa’s first roles or bad sound directing; either way, for a Japanese dub, all of the voices sound pretty horrendous. The romance between all of the characters is uncomfortably forced; there is no chemistry between any of the characters―it just happens. The main couple start hanging out because the male protagonist keeps following her around and asking her out, like a creep! And all of the other characters fall in love for no reason at all, there’s not a build-up, it’s just there… like most of the things that happen in this series.•\tThe focus of the story is these people, practically have the equivalent to bug (無視) stands (JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure reference), because the characters contractually merge souls with the insects (in the anime it is translated to souls, but the light novel translation translates their spirit binding into the form of dreams) with, or so the story leads you to believe; so much of the plot consistency is hard to follow. I was confused about the explanation of the “Fallen,” they briefly explain that it’s what happens when a human’s mushi is destroyed; they become “Fallen,” but it’s very convoluted. Many of the plot points seem skimmed through, or they just expect you to understand without explanation? The series is based off a light novel series, and the length of the entire novel series is crunched into only twelve episodes, that’s probably where they went wrong? The GARDEN plot seems incredibly important, but is only referenced through expositional chats. The story focuses more on the friendship between Rina and Shīka, and scenes with Shīka wearing sexy outfits, more than it ever bothers to bring up what the hell is happening in the storyline!•\tThe “emotional” scenes aren’t given time to blossom, every time something happens―the scene transition so quickly that it’s hard to grasp anything, emotionally or mentally (it’s like: well, I guess that happened… ), or the story layers on more plot twists into an intense scene, making the episode more of a head-scratch than an epiphany; all of this happened because the studio obviously didn’t have the foresight to fit all of the required narrative dialogues into the anime. The directorial vision is interesting, but the plot is all over the place; I mean, I thought that this was supposed to be a story about battling bug monsters (?) and there’s a filler episode about a group of mushi-using thugs trapping a girl in a video camera… that was probably one of the worst episodes ever; it even mirrors the Omnimon arc in Digimon: The Movie. This series has already ripped the Digimon Emperor’s design, did we really need an entire episode homaging the cyber-space battle in its spiritual predecessor?•\tOverall, this series is a giant flop. Which is disappointing because I was drawn into the atmosphere of the first episode; I expected it to be an unpolished gem like Shigofumi. The character designs look like an edgy version of Uta~Kata, which I would have been down for, although Uta~Kata itself was a flop. Withering away in the annals of time, Mushi-Uta is a forgettable relic from 2007 that I rate a 3/10; I would only recommend if you like the designs, otherwise, it’s skippable! is flushed, like a spider down a drain.

Naruto: Akaki Yotsuba no Clover wo Sagase,https://myanimelist.net/anime/761/Naruto__Akaki_Yotsuba_no_Clover_wo_Sagase,"['Esta review también está en español.Naruto: Find the Crimson Four-leaf Clover! is the first special ever created for Naruto, and was shown at the Jump Festa 2003. We can say (almost affirm) that this was the first attempt to exploit this highly successful anime...Located after the land of the waves saga, but before the chunin exams, the story is about how Konohamaru falls for Kaede, a girl that, sadly, is moving from the village. To avoid this, Konohamaru asks Naruto to help him in the search for the crimson four-leaf clover, which according to the legend, is able to fulfill any wish. Unfortunately, this magic...clover is in Akagahara, better known as ""that damn forest where the second chunin exam happens"". That means, danger and traps everywhere. But fear not, Sasuke and Sakura will eventually go and help, so nobody will die :P.Visually, this special is fine, nothing spectacular, just like one of the first episodes of the anime. Same with the sound.But everything written above could be known simply by reading the synopsis and looking at the date of publication. The only important question that you, my reader, should be having now is... This thing worth it? Well, this is a clear example of what people see, with terror, as filler. FILLER. I know that almost every special can be seen as filler, but this one is in the bad sense of the word. We can say there are good filler and bad filler. Good filler: see Kakashi\'s face (silly ep, but funny). Bad filler: remember the curry thing? Well, this special would be in the middle (closest to the bad side): this isn\'t a good episode on its own (it was very early in the story, so there weren\'t  much ninja techniques... or characters... or ideas), but it\'s not as bad as the baddest, unwatchable, eye-ripping fillers (and is only seventeen minutes long, so it\'s bearable). I recommend this only for the (very) fans. The special Battle at the Hidden Falls is longer, with better quality and more content/fights. Without being and outstanding special either, i find it more recommendable.--------Naruto: Find the Crimson Four-leaf Clover! es el primer especial/OVA creado de Naruto, y fue exhibido en el Jump Festa del 2003. La verdad, se nota que este fue el primer intento de explotar este exitosísimo anime...Ubicada después de la saga del país de las olas, pero antes de los exámenes chunin, la  historia trata de cómo Konohamaru se enamora de Kaede, una chica que se está mudando de la aldea. Para evitarlo, Konohamaru le pide a Naruto que lo ayude a buscar el trébol carmesí de cuatro hojas, que según la leyenda, es capaz de cumplir cualquier deseo.

Recomendable solo para los (muy) fanáticos de Naruto. El especial Batalla en la cascada oculta es más largo, de mejor calidad, y pasan más cosas (sin ser tampoco tremendamente espectacular), por lo que me parece más recomendable. clover is in Akagahara, better known as ""that damn forest where the second chunin exam happens"". That means, danger and traps everywhere. But fear not, Sasuke and Sakura will eventually go and help, so nobody will die :P.Visually, this special is fine, nothing spectacular, just like one of the first episodes of the anime. Same with the sound.But everything written above could be known simply by reading the synopsis and looking at the date of publication. The only important question that you, my reader, should be having now is... This thing worth it? Well, this is a clear example of what people see, with terror, as filler. FILLER. I know that almost every special can be seen as filler, but this one is in the bad sense of the word. We can say there are good filler and bad filler. Good filler: see Kakashi\'s face (silly ep, but funny). Bad filler: remember the curry thing? Well, this special would be in the middle (closest to the bad side): this isn\'t a good episode on its own (it was very early in the story, so there weren\'t  much ninja techniques... or characters... or ideas), but it\'s not as bad as the baddest, unwatchable, eye-ripping fillers (and is only seventeen minutes long, so it\'s bearable). I recommend this only for the (very) fans. The special Battle at the Hidden Falls is longer, with better quality and more content/fights. Without being and outstanding special either, i find it more recommendable.--------Naruto: Find the Crimson Four-leaf Clover! es el primer especial/OVA creado de Naruto, y fue exhibido en el Jump Festa del 2003. La verdad, se nota que este fue el primer intento de explotar este exitosísimo anime...Ubicada después de la saga del país de las olas, pero antes de los exámenes chunin, la  historia trata de cómo Konohamaru se enamora de Kaede, una chica que se está mudando de la aldea. Para evitarlo, Konohamaru le pide a Naruto que lo ayude a buscar el trébol carmesí de cuatro hojas, que según la leyenda, es capaz de cumplir cualquier deseo.

They should be funny and a sort of comic relief. I usually like the Naruto specials, but I couldn\'t stand this one.The story focuses around Konohamaru and Naruto searching for a secret wish-granting clover that will hopefully prevent Konohamaru\'s crush from moving away from the village. I personally loathe Konohamaru as a character and find him exceptionally annoying. The jokes were lame and the artwork was worse than the parent story. If you\'re trying to watch a Naruto special, I recommend any other than this, as this was probably the worst that I...have watched. have watched.', ""Given the length of this special, my expectations were minimal. If you're looking for development or something that deepens the characterization or plot, this is not the one for you. But if you're okay with a simple slice of life that shows more of the characters you've grown to love, then maybe give this a go. I adore both Naruto and Konohamaru and always look forward to their banter and interactions, so it's no surprise that I enjoyed this. Sure, the special is incredibly short, and the plot is a straightforward minor adventure, but it has the characters' usual funny antics and the charm of...Konohamaru's first crush, a landmark I was happy to witness however briefly.

The animation is good, and the action is pretty cool. Time flew by very quick when I watched it, and the plot kept me engaged throughout. Konohamaru got to be special in this episode, which was a nice change and Naruto got to be the usual funny action hero: the main thing I always expect whenever I watch something related to the character. Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi managed to shine in their own ways, and the little girl introduced in this short was also pretty adorable. Overall, this is...an immensely enjoyable episode and something a true Naruto fan will definitely enjoy.

Recommended.', '<Potential Spoilers>I can see why this was an OVA.Everything about this ova is unnecessary and generic. The horrifically generic storyline, decent animation, and ok sound design are only saved by the interactions of characters Naruto and Konohamaru.The story can be summed up in this single sentence. Konohamaru needs Naruto to try and get with a girl. While the story of trying to get a girl can be done right. This OVA presents the story in a way that is forgettable and just boring.The animation is decent, it’s around the same quality as most other Naruto episodes. I don’t know if it had something to do...with the quality of the copy I had of the OVA or the actual OVA itself had this quality. But I could only play it at like 144p. For now, I will only assume it was a result of the poor copy I had.There’s really not that much too say about the sound design other then the voice acting was decent. That’s it.The characters Naruto and Konohamaru interacting and working with each other made the ova slightly more bearable. It was fun seeing these two interacting. But that’s really all the OVA had going for it.While this review is short, the OVA has nothing going for it. A generic story, ok animation, and ok sound design are only forgiven through the somewhat enjoyable character interactions.Overall, I rank this 4/10. with the quality of the copy I had of the OVA or the actual OVA itself had this quality.

Ojisan to Marshmallow,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31848/Ojisan_to_Marshmallow,"['Even though these episodes may be ""marshallow"" sized, every second of each episode is packed with hilarity, suggestive innuendos, misunderstandings, workplace sexual harrassment and a genuine feeling of heart.Hige-san is an overweight office worker for a ""web-related company"" (actual name of it, no joke) and he has an obsession for marshmallows, a trait which is further examined in episode 4. He works along Wakabayashi-kun, a 24 year old female office worker who has a similar obsession with marshmallows, AND Hige-san.Wakabayashi is attracted to Hige and orchestrates several situations in which they can get closer. The punchline is, Hige-san is a very introverted and polite older...man, completely oblivious to Wakabayashi\'s advances, which creates many hilarious misunderstandings and eventually boils down to the two of them consuming bags of marshmallows.The side characters are few and kinda forgetful. Wakabayashi\'s two female work friends turn up in a few episodes and say a few things without really leaving an impact, and Wakabayashi\'s brother has only just come into the series recently. But without a doubt, the stand out character in this series so far (apart from the main characters) is the Section Chief. He is hilarious and becomes completely content with the misunderstandings taking place. But you\'ll find out more about that when you watch the show.UPDATE: A new challenger for Hige-san\'s affection approaches! Hijinks ensue! And she has a Kansai accent! Kawaii!This is such a sweet and innocent story, and at only 3 minutes a piece, they are delightful to binge with only a short amount of time.I look forward to seeing how this show progresses. man, completely oblivious to Wakabayashi\'s advances, which creates many hilarious misunderstandings and eventually boils down to the two of them consuming bags of marshmallows.The side characters are few and kinda forgetful.

Spoilers ahead!)Ojisan to Marshmallow contains, not surprisingly, a lot of marshmallows.I recently purchased some. The multicolored, multiflavored kind. I’m actually eating them as I type out this paragraph. The anime inspired me to pick them up from the grocery store to see what all the hubbub was about.After eating a few handfuls, I am not too keen on having more. While it’s watching instead of eating, the same can be said of Marshmallow.STORYMarshmallow is as long as marshmallows are short. At about three minutes an episode, the anime has little time to create a simple and...sweet show.As such, it targets three separate yet unified angles: comedy, romance, and lewdness. Everything wrapped together by white-and-tasty marshmallows.Much of the comedy is realistic enough to make sense but far-fetched enough to be considered silly given the circumstances. Iori leading Hige with a toasted marshmallow. The marshmallow makers believing in the “marshmallow fairy” (i.e., Hige). Iori’s brother dressing up as a woman in an attempt to single out Hige as an evil man.The romance route initially just involves Iori and Hige. Technically only Iori because Hige is oblivious to any and all of her advances. Later on, the anime introduces Mio, another woman vying for Hige, creating a largely unnecessary love triangle. It does cut down on the repetitive nature of Iori trying and failing to seduce Hige, but, when the anime does not have a lot of time to work with, getting in the way of the “established” romance (that already is not going anywhere) does not make much sense.As for the lewdness, it spices up the festivities – even if marshmallows are not inherently sexy. Iori trying to show off her “twenty-four-year-old marshmallows” or Iori seductively leaning over with a marshmallow in her mouth create a few moments as steamy as a marshmallow over an open bonfire.A lot of the time, Marshmallow combines all three angles. Iori fakes moaning while Hige speaks on the phone in order to make their relationship sound more risqué. Mio’s breasts censored with “J-Cup” tags. Both Iori and Hige squished together in the in-between of a subway cart. All examples of the show using its different elements as well as it can.Surprisingly, however, Marshmallow’s biggest problem is the element that ties the three previous ones together: the marshmallows. Despite the prevalence of and the importance given to marshmallows, the anime does not take advantage of its premise enough. It can, such as the brother using marshmallows to make a fake bosom, but, most of the time, it is just their smell that gets attention.Nevertheless, the anime aims for and provides exactly what it set out to give. Nothing more and nothing less.Just like a marshmallow.ANIMATIONThe art of Marshmallow is rather soft. Many of the locations and the presentation in general are not exactly detailed, but they have a softness to them that makes the anime as light as the ‘mallows it contains.Actual animation tends to remain low, although this outcome is mostly due to the nature of the show: Characters often stand around without moving. The anime either shows a couple of characters having a quick conversation or letting the cast react to a bag of marshmallows. Some instances, like Iori dodging or chasing after Hige, can prove that the anime does have some animation chops, but these moments are the exception rather than the rule.Without a doubt, the designs of the main characters are the strongest part of the art. In fact, their looks are reminiscent of marshmallows: round, simple, and fluffy. From head to body, Hige is rotund. Iori owns a simplistic depiction – plain clothes, brown hair, and short ponytail. Mio’s figure makes her fluffy in all the right places.CHARACTERSContinuing with the marshmallow metaphors, the cast is a marshmallow. They do not have a whole lot going for them. They do not change much over the course of their run. They are consistent in their actions.These traits sound negative (and to some extent they are), but, to reiterate, the show is short. Meaning, expecting grandiose development or complex characters from an anime about romance and marshmallows may not be the fairest of outlooks.Breaking the characters down more accurately helps to see the previous metaphor. Hige loves marshmallows more than anything else. He is also dense – both of mind and body. Iori, on the other hand, loves Hige more than anything else. Plus, she is so forward that Hige mistakes her lust for scariness. As for Mio, she is somewhat selfish and slightly rude. She also competes with Iori for Hige’s attention as best she can.Their relationships demonstrate a bit more about them. Hige treats Iori in the same way he treats his marshmallows: with respect. Iori has less intimidating sides to her than at first believed. She does not like the word “normal” (which she later desensitizes herself to), she knows how to cook, and so on. Mio is actually dating the president of Web-Related Company (the place where they work), making her feelings for Hige seem immature.Anything else about the characters is unfortunately a negative. The actual strength of their relationships is lacking; the anime relies more on their individual selves rather than their grouping. Iori backing out of her confession, despite her forward personality, makes little sense. Hige rarely contributes to the comedy. Mio showing up again and trying to steal Hige away from Iori after Mio seemingly lost comes off as unfocused.While these negatives are not that heavy, they weigh down this light-as-a-marshmallow cast.SOUNDSound-wise, Marshmallow understandably does not have a whole lot in this department. It skips out on having an opening track for its episodes to make way for more content in its short three minutes (a wise decision).And while it does have a few different ending tracks to offer, they are tiny pieces that exist solely to indicate the end of the episode. They are not catchy or complex. In fact, Iori’s ED has a grating start to it that sounds quite out of place.Similar words can be said (or, in this case, written) about the original soundtrack. It’s a marshmallow-handful of slice-of-life tracks. Dainty, simple, and tame.The voice acting, however, is a step above the musical offerings. Eri Kitamura as Iori has a mild way of speaking that is strangely alluring. Tetsu Inada as Hige uses a low and slow manner of talking that makes him the middle-aged gentleman that the anime’s title confers. And Kana Hanazawa as Mio included a nice accent for the “marshmallow-stealing” character.ENJOYMENTWhile I didn’t much care for Hige – he was a bit too passive – Iori was a hoot. She is decidedly plain, but her determination to get Hige to notice her had me smiling throughout the season.All of episode two, from the music getting cutoff after Iori tries to point out her wet clothes to her slamming her umbrella on Hige’s head, had me laughing. My other favorite moment happened in episode ten on the Ferris wheel. Iori hurling a few choice cuss words at Mio after she reveals her already-a-girlfriend status was hilarious.What I despised, though, was the anime redacting even the slightest amount of progress on the romance. It was essentially one misunderstanding after another. The ending got them slightly closer since Hige no longer found Iori scary. But Iori going back on her words and Hige still unable to put two and two together made me more than frustrated with the whole season.(And a small shout-out to the smiling boss with the big cheeks. He didn’t say much, but his extra silliness made me smile, too.)Ojisan to Marshmallow offers about as much as marshmallows can. In other words, not a whole lot. A three-angled story, a simple cast, and some nice character designs are melted by not enough variety, poor musical decisions, and quite the frustrating romance. More marsh than mallow.SUMMARYStory: Fine, comedy, romance, and lewdness hurt by underutilizing the premiseAnimation: Fine, soft art, low actual animation, and marshmallow character designsCharacters: Bad, Iori, Hige, and Mio are simple characters weighed down by tiny yet heavy negativesSound: Bad, bad EDs, bad OST, nice VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, Iori was fun but the romance was frustratingFinal Score: 4/10 sweet show.As such, it targets three separate yet unified angles: comedy, romance, and lewdness.

It's essentially just a girl with no real personality teasing an obese guy with marshmallows because she loves him and likes to play with him or something. It's ridiculous. There are no proper or clever jokes, it's all simple teasing by waving marshmallows in front of him, buying them first etc and having the fatty chase her and try to take the marshmallows. That's all it's about. It deserves a lower score than what people have given it.Really, it's horribly bland. Each episode is around 3 minutes at most, yet...I just managed to get through six of them before I dropped it out of frustration(Less than one normal episode of most other animes). I mean, who even thought this would be a good idea? Geez. You need some really special humor to enjoy this thing. I usually spend at least a few episodes of a normal anime before getting fed up enough to drop it, but this thing managed to make me do so in less than the amount of time it takes to watch one of those episodes. It offers absolutely nothing in terms of enjoyment and I felt bored half to death. It could've made some clever jokes or something but didn't.

From the first episode it\'s easy to tell that the anime is something special, and its three-minute time limit actually enhances it by having the show have many quick gags and situational comedy situations.The characters are all very likable (even the ""antagonist"" of sorts that shows up three-fourths of a way through the show) and all adults, something we don\'t see enough of in anime.The majority of the show\'s comedy comes from marshmallows, which you\'d think would wear thin after...a while, but alas, Ojisan to Marshmallow manages to make every good gag and sexual innuendo out of marshmallows possible while still remaining charming and not feeling stupid/corny.The voice actress for the main female character Iori (Eri Kitamura) really deserves some kind of award for the amount of character and emotion she put into Iori\'s voice. It\'s possible a lot of anime fans have only heard her in supporting roles before, but if you ask me she deserves more main roles. The scene in the second episode in which she does these monotone-yet-pleasured sounding fake sexual moans was hilarious.In conclusion, Ojisan to Marshmallow is the best anime about marshmallows of all time, and among my favorite short series I\'ve seen. I highly recommend it, because what else are you doing? This will take less than an hour. Put the doujin down and spend a little time with this quirky comedy. a while, but alas, Ojisan to Marshmallow manages to make every good gag and sexual innuendo out of marshmallows possible while still remaining charming and not feeling stupid/corny.The voice actress for the main female character Iori (Eri Kitamura) really deserves some kind of award for the amount of character and emotion she put into Iori\'s voice.

In each episode, which is typically under three minutes, we find Hige in various situations where he ends up being teased by Iori, who always seems to have a bag of marshmallows on hand. The simplicity of the situation combined with the relatable and comedic circumstances makes for a pretty good viewing; you can\'t help but feel for Iori who can\'t muster up the courage to ask Hige out, relegating herself to teasing him with marshmallows.Among 4-koma type shows, this...is up there along with Dannaken- definitely give it a try!Animation:You really aren\'t supposed to expect too much in this category from 4-koma shows. This show follows the trend of having a simplistic overall look with fairly bright coloring. The characters aren\'t the most expressive out there, especially since Hige is a bit of a dunce and Iori is a kuudere. Despite the childish nature of the marshmallow theme, there are some scenes that will make more sense for teenagers and above. I think I only recall one scene being lightly censored.Sound:There\'s no OP but a multitude of EDs (I counted six?) by Eri Kitamura and Kana Hanazawa. Both Message and Labyrinth are the main EDs that you\'ll hear repeatedly. They\'re playful and short so it\'s not hard to add on the extra thirty seconds. The BGM is fair but nothing memorable.As for VAs, well you have Eri Kitamura and Kana Hanazawa (hearing her sing ""I\'m an idol"" is somewhat funny at multiple levels), enough said. Expect a great performance overall from the cast, especially our star veterans.Story:So Hige is a kind-hearted but unfathomably dense man, who can\'t figure out that Iori, his coworker, really likes him; despite her trying to show it at every turn- mostly in a respectable fashion, not like in B Gata H Kei. There isn\'t anything really complicated about the plot, the only tension being Iori\'s rival showing up halfway through the show. This tease will consume a total of just over thirty minutes and contains quite a few good laughs and a few rather touching moments; yes you\'ll get more in this 4-koma than you will from your run of the mill full-length comedic harem.Character:Given the length of the show, you can\'t really expect much dynamic character development. That said, the interactions overall were enjoyable and more believable than some standard shonen harems. I\'m not sure that the ""cooking with marshmallows"" episode add-ons were all that valuable, so unless you want to see Hige in real life trying to stuff his mouth with marshmallow-based concoctions you can skip this.Value:If you\'re looking for a short show with a good dosage of relationship-based comedy, this is an easy recommendation.

It doesn't have the wild set pieces or mind numbing plot twists, what with it being a short 2 minute anime based of a Pixiv webcomic, but there's still something endearing and lovely about this anime.It's at its heart a very simple working life/romantic comedy anime. Slow paced and relaxing. None of the jokes are particularly funny or memorable, but they just hit that right spot of just being satisfactory. Characters are fun to follow but do not mature or grow any depth. Still, this format doesn't lend itself well to complicated stories, so this is as good as we...can get.As average as this anime is, I still smiled at the end of the anime.

It\'s a very basic ecchi show about a couple of high school students who are \'married\' and live under the same roof together and hang out with their friends. Scenarios ensue in which the girls are either forced to remove...as much clothing as possible or they find themselves in a situation in which they\'re groped by our main protagonist. That\'s it!

But you're not here for any of that.  Hell, if you're watching Okusama, you're here for one thing and one thing only.  Boobs.Story: This second season of Okusama 'continues' off of the first season with relatively the same goals and ambitions of the first season with none of the progress.  At all.  What's presented as a second season of...the series comes off as a dozen of 7 minute comedic OVAs with little to no continuity from episode to episode.  The formula for each episode starts with our protagonist Hayato Izumi engaging in some innocent situation with one or more members of the female cast (most commonly the two girls who are seen as his romantic interests), which eventually turns into a sexual situation that usually involves touching one's privates in some fashion or another, stopping before anything that constitutes as pornography can occur.Beyond that, this virtually plotless piece of entertainment doesn't have anything else worth of value of mentioning.  Due to its nature as a seven minute short dedicated to entertaining whomever's watching with some relatively high sexual content, I don't really see much reason to go above and beyond with the show's minute nuances.  The high school and student council backdrop is a facade that doesn't get used that much, the characters are shallow and not much progress towards character development is actually made, and honestly, I don't see why anyone would actually watch this show for that things.  If you're watching this, you're watching this for boobs.Overview:+ Boobs (I can't not make this a positive, as it's...probably the two reasons why people watch this.)-  Everything else is shallow.  (Plot, story, characters, everything.)Characters:  The characters are the same.  Izumi's still holding in the urge to attack any piece of femininity that's hung in front of him, Ui still wants her fiance to notice, love, and probably deflower her, and Misumi's still that annoying tsundere character with too much pride as a morals committee member and jiggle physics.  Oh yeah, and I guess Karen, Niikuma, and Sawatari are there too.  You met them in season 1, and you'll see the exact same people in season 2 cause nothing changes.The only new character we're introduced to is Saijou, the president of the photography club.  Presented as a comedic flirt who'll get the perfect shot by any means necessary, Saijou's character has the same pitfalls as everyone else, being a character that has no meaningful development or character, but is thrown in as a wrench in the works rather than a piece of meat for the male viewing audience to ogle over.  At least, not as much as the others.  So yeah, those're our characters.  Shallow examples of people with as much depth as a cardboard cutout.  Whoopee.Overview:+/-  One dimensional people (It...kinda works?  Mostly cause the show doesn't give them enough time at all to even be remotely developed.)Art: Produced by Seven, a studio whose biggest accomplishments are Danna ga Nani and...various hentai (whoo, there's a spectrum), it doesn't come as a surprise that in terms of art quality, Okusama has some very average artwork mixed in with some surprisingly well done erotic scenes.  But unless you're here for a pair of mammary glands, don't expect the art to be all that spectacular.Sound:  The music's not worth it.  Voice acting...you'll get quite a few moans, so fair warning, watch this with headphones, and with your computer facing away from the door.Personal Enjoyment: To be completely honest, I don't really have much to say.  The manga piqued my interest, and I watched the corresponding anime.  Personally, nothing about this series really warrants me to like or despise it in a drastic manner.  I have my two cents, but in terms of overall enjoyment, I neither liked it nor hated it.Did I like this series?Eh...Boobs were nice, I guess?  Boobs are always nice.  Jiggle physics are a bit laughable and improbable, but what the hell do you want?  It's anime.What didn't I like about this series?Karen, and...Misumi.  Their characters are annoying.  And because the characters are as shallow as a one foot pool, nothing about them will EVER change.  SO that's annoying, I suppose.Would I recommend this anime?If you really want to get something out of your system, or just really like boobs, then I suppose this is a good watch?  Keep in mind, the only thing you'll get outta this series is boobs.  Nothing more, nothing less.  If you want anything more than that, then watch some hentai; it's the next best thing. the series comes off as a dozen of 7 minute comedic OVAs with little to no continuity from episode to episode.

Presented as a comedic flirt who'll get the perfect shot by any means necessary, Saijou's character has the same pitfalls as everyone else, being a character that has no meaningful development or character, but is thrown in as a wrench in the works rather than a piece of meat for the male viewing audience to ogle over.  At least, not as much as the others.  So yeah, those're our characters.  Shallow examples of people with as much depth as a cardboard cutout.  Whoopee.Overview:+/-  One dimensional people (It...kinda works?  Mostly cause the show doesn't give them enough time at all to even be remotely developed.)Art: Produced by Seven, a studio whose biggest accomplishments are Danna ga Nani and...various hentai (whoo, there's a spectrum), it doesn't come as a surprise that in terms of art quality, Okusama has some very average artwork mixed in with some surprisingly well done erotic scenes.  But unless you're here for a pair of mammary glands, don't expect the art to be all that spectacular.Sound:  The music's not worth it.  Voice acting...you'll get quite a few moans, so fair warning, watch this with headphones, and with your computer facing away from the door.Personal Enjoyment: To be completely honest, I don't really have much to say.  The manga piqued my interest, and I watched the corresponding anime.  Personally, nothing about this series really warrants me to like or despise it in a drastic manner.  I have my two cents, but in terms of overall enjoyment, I neither liked it nor hated it.Did I like this series?Eh...Boobs were nice, I guess?  Boobs are always nice.  Jiggle physics are a bit laughable and improbable, but what the hell do you want?  It's anime.What didn't I like about this series?Karen, and...Misumi.  Their characters are annoying.  And because the characters are as shallow as a one foot pool, nothing about them will EVER change.  SO that's annoying, I suppose.Would I recommend this anime?If you really want to get something out of your system, or just really like boobs, then I suppose this is a good watch?  Keep in mind, the only thing you'll get outta this series is boobs.  Nothing more, nothing less.  If you want anything more than that, then watch some hentai; it's the next best thing."", ""I feel like I would have enjoyed it far more if I seen it when I was 13. I think that's actually the target audience.

I know it's an ecchi anime and that's the main focus, however this season turned it into a full-fledged harem anime.

Quite frankly, it was a drop in quality from the previous season. Certain tropes, played a lot but not too much in the first season, are well overused to the point the story suffers and pushes it into the uncanny valley of comedy.

My reason why is well... IT DOES EVEN HAVE ONE ANYWAY. All it comes down to is either A. Izumi gets aroused and visualize the girl naked. or B. Have some more ecchi jokes and that's all there's to it. The whole purpose of the series was to establish a relationship with Ui and Izumi.

Spoilers ahead!)My wonderful sister got married near the end of last year.Her husband (now my brother-in-law) are perfect for one another. They have each other’s backs, putting up with the other’s “baggage” despite their differences. And with him being one of the nicest guys that I know, and her being overly supportive, they are as compatible as can be.I know they’ll have a successful, happy marriage moving forward. At the minimum, they’ll be a lot better off than whatever Okusama ga Seitokaichou!+! presented.STORYAs expected, Okusama contains similar content to that of the first season. Izumi and...Ui are shacked up, leading to the pair’s multitude of sexual romps. Unfortunately, Okusama also includes a ton of unnecessary elements that ultimately ruin the entire experience.Chief among its problems is a refusal to let any of its sexual content play out. Not only in first-second-third base terms but also in emotional terms too. Izumi and Ui are about to passionately kiss? In barges Rin to stop it before it even happens. They’re about to get frisky in bed? Sorry, Izumi, but premature ejaculation would like a word. A Rin-and-Ui double feature ready and waiting? Whoops, Rin’s sister conveniently shows up to say a few words and derail the fornication.Even when the anime finally has the guts to show off its sexual content, much of it simply lacks spice or at least variety. One too many almost-touched-lips kisses with Izumi and groping without any flair lead from one boring sexual encounter to another. Izumi helping Ui take a suppository is as adventurous as the anime gets.These events and the ones outside the realm of debauchery also go against Okusama’s previous season’s theme on marriage even more so than ever before. The anime constantly places Izumi in situations that don’t involve Ui whatsoever or simply don’t mesh with the marriage aspect of their relationship.For instance, they raid the photography club’s clubroom, but it’s an event that has little (if anything) to do with how Ui and Izumi get along. What occurs, then, is a slew of scenes that should have never been allowed to happen in the first place since they continue to reinforce why the anime does not deserve to be titled My Wife Is the Student Council President.The anime does keep its motif in mind on occasion, like when Ui complains about Izumi not giving her enough attention (and touching) or when Izumi eats the food Ui concocted despite its nefarious aura (because that’s what a man should do). Sadly, Okusama would much rather give Rin yet another unnecessary shot with the male lead, bringing the anime back towards polygamy.Okusama does have its small moments. The condom that Rin’s older sister gave to Izumi returns as a joke later in the season when Rin discovers it in his desk drawer, and the final episode proves that the anime didn’t forget about Ui’s parents from last season, giving them a miniscule cameo to cap off this this season. Plus, it does have the usual cute pouts and comedic jokes to fill the gaps between the promiscuous asides.Unfortunately, so much of the content is boring, aggravating, or otherwise lacking that whatever else Okusama attempts to do cannot heal its self-inflicted wounds.ANIMATIONIn this second season of Okusama, the amount of actual animation seems to have decreased. Characters will sometimes shift forward without moving their limbs, and the events themselves usually end up as just the characters speaking to one another while standing. Rin’s breasts do jiggle at every opportunity, but that’s not enough to justify how static a lot of the scenes feel. Especially when the sexual content refuses to give much more than Ui sucking Izumi’s finger or showcasing yet another still-framed picture of the girls as naked as possible.Speaking of the sexual content, the anime at least (and once again) provides a censored and uncensored version.Naturally (and once again once again), the uncensored material is the biggest draw of the show and wins out over the censored material. Granted, all that’s really shown are nipples, and the explicit material that’s too tough to cover up with baby chicks is replaced with theatrics that aim for cute, comedic relief. But the crotch shots, despite their perversion, are why the audience are there in the first place, so uncensored is really the only way to go.The artistry in general still doesn’t impress, but it gets the job done. While the fast-moving backgrounds and the talking-head bubbles are relied on more than usual, Rin and Ui still have their attractive designs, and the silly reactions with the squatter, comedic depictions of the characters invites the cuteness and the funniness with ease.CHARACTERSAs an ecchi, comedic short, Okusama doesn’t have the character depth that regular dramas tend to include. However, that doesn’t excuse the anime from a lot of choices it makes regarding its cast.For example, Rin receives a lot more attention this season. Said attention is mostly going towards her chest, but Okusama also highlights her naivety when it comes to love and the difficulty she has in accepting Ui’s working theories on letting lust live. Thus, Rin starts to take part in the lasciviousness, letting Izumi release his pent-up hormones with her breasts or thinking about buying a black bra to satiate Izumi’s own desires.Yet, during most of Rin’s sexual interactions with Izumi, the outcome is the same: punching him in the face. Despite initiating the situation herself, she’s the one who ends it (often in a violent manner).To be fair, her even putting herself in those situations is arguably a big step forward for her, considering her role as the head of the disciplinary committee and her previously discussed naivety. But she never truly leaves this quasi state of liking-Izumi-but-not-really. Plus, it gets quite old quite fast to see her stop her progression for the umpteenth time when she was the one to start it in the first place.Ui and Izumi are no better. Arguably, they are worse.As a (supposed) couple, they don’t have very many scenes together. With Rin refusing to go away, the introduction of Honoka, and the comedy involving the side characters, Ui and Izumi rarely have any alone time. When they finally are alone, they almost never exchange words of love or commitment, and the relationship they do share does not rise above friends with benefits.It gets worse. Looking at Ui and Izumi individually, they don’t help themselves or each other.Ui constantly lets Izumi take part in situations with the other characters that will inevitably become sexually charged. She either has no idea, is oblivious, or, worst of all, simply doesn’t care.Izumi is similar. His instincts will eventually control him if pushed to his absolute limit, but these moments are rather uncommon. Sometimes, he himself won’t let their relationship move forward, like when he “has to go to the bathroom” when Ui says right to his face how she won’t run away from him, readying herself to kiss him outright.As for everyone else, Okusama should get some credit for providing its side characters with a moment or two to shine. Ayane gets to see what it is like to have a boyfriend, Karen learns to not hate Izumi’s guts as much, and Honoka creates some scenarios for Izumi, Ui, and Rin to comingle within.But even this credit is difficult to see as a positive when one realizes that they are also getting in the way of what is supposed to be a “marriage” between Ui and Izumi. Ayane gets somewhat tacked on as last-ditch option for Izumi, Karen’s episode doesn’t incorporate Ui to any large extent, and Honoka comes off as an unnecessary addition to the cast when she barely contributes to the plot besides snapping a few phots here and there.Again, Okusama isn’t a “deep” anime, and the sole reason for watching it is to see some occasional boobies, so a lot of these gripes are “pointless.” Still, when the anime is arguably an anime about Ui and Izumi, and what’s presented is anything but, the show does not do itself any favors.SOUNDThe opening track and the ending track are (understandably) small pieces that help to set the tone for Okusama.The OP uses piano and drums to create a fast beat with a sense of nostalgia, but the grating instrumental in the background is way too distracting no matter how many bells go off. The ED is even shorter than the OP (twenty seconds versus thirty seconds), but it stands as the better of the two thanks to its happier feeling through blaring trumpets. Also, letting the voice actresses for Ui, Rin, and Honoka sing their own versions of the ED gives it more variety than its OP counterpart.These voice actresses are Ayana Taketatsu, Minami Tsuda, and Sora Tokui (respectively). While Ms. Tokui does not have any notable scenes, Ms. Taketatsu knows how to pout, Ms. Tsuda has the authoritative drive, and the two can moan when needed.(And a small shout-out to the talking hormones, condoms, and erections that supported the show in comedic fashion.)The rest of the original soundtrack remains the same as the first season. A light piano backs the romantic scenes and steps along for the sillier ones. And a nice acoustic guitar accompanies the quieter, simpler times.ENJOYMENTOnce again, I find myself conflicted over an anime.On the one hand, it’s frustrating to watch many of the scenes play out when they almost always conclude with some interruption or unnatural shove in the opposite direction. A lot of this interrupting and shoving derives from Rin, but Ui is no better when she fails to make any significant strides due to her odd choices. To be fair, Izumi is just as much at fault with everything as these two, but he at least has the excuse that he’s at their mercy most of the time.On the other hand, I like both girls. Ui has the caring personality that I find very attractive, and Rin has the bombshell looks that get my head turning. Ui made me laugh with her huge pouts, Rin had me smiling at her blushes, and the two together were no doubt arousing when it came to their ecchi escapades (even if they weren’t exactly novel).I want to like this one more than I do, but the anime makes it hard to do so. The show should just go all the way in one direction with either Rin or Ui. Enough of the back-and-forth, maybe-maybe-not wishy-washiness. Because the anime is cute and funny and arousing – but it just doesn’t know what it ultimately wants to be.Okusama ga Seitokaichou!+! ends up worse off than its previous season. Further deviation from its marriage motif, less animation, and not enough focus on Ui and Izumi are its biggest mistakes. Its art and music remain consistent, but it’s a show that one will part with long before death.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, constant refusal to let events play out and even more unnecessary “polygamy” entirely defeat the purpose of the narrativeAnimation: Fine, while less movement occurs, the uncensored material and the comedic portrayals keep the visuals both alluring and funCharacters: Terrible, Ui and Izumi’s relationship goes nowhere as they and those around them impede their progress without failSound: Fine, bad OP, okay ED, okay OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, Rin and Ui are likable, but having both together only makes things unlikableFinal Score: 3/10 Ui are shacked up, leading to the pair’s multitude of sexual romps.

Sometimes, he himself won’t let their relationship move forward, like when he “has to go to the bathroom” when Ui says right to his face how she won’t run away from him, readying herself to kiss him outright.As for everyone else, Okusama should get some credit for providing its side characters with a moment or two to shine. Ayane gets to see what it is like to have a boyfriend, Karen learns to not hate Izumi’s guts as much, and Honoka creates some scenarios for Izumi, Ui, and Rin to comingle within.But even this credit is difficult to see as a positive when one realizes that they are also getting in the way of what is supposed to be a “marriage” between Ui and Izumi. Ayane gets somewhat tacked on as last-ditch option for Izumi, Karen’s episode doesn’t incorporate Ui to any large extent, and Honoka comes off as an unnecessary addition to the cast when she barely contributes to the plot besides snapping a few phots here and there.Again, Okusama isn’t a “deep” anime, and the sole reason for watching it is to see some occasional boobies, so a lot of these gripes are “pointless.” Still, when the anime is arguably an anime about Ui and Izumi, and what’s presented is anything but, the show does not do itself any favors.SOUNDThe opening track and the ending track are (understandably) small pieces that help to set the tone for Okusama.The OP uses piano and drums to create a fast beat with a sense of nostalgia, but the grating instrumental in the background is way too distracting no matter how many bells go off. The ED is even shorter than the OP (twenty seconds versus thirty seconds), but it stands as the better of the two thanks to its happier feeling through blaring trumpets. Also, letting the voice actresses for Ui, Rin, and Honoka sing their own versions of the ED gives it more variety than its OP counterpart.These voice actresses are Ayana Taketatsu, Minami Tsuda, and Sora Tokui (respectively). While Ms. Tokui does not have any notable scenes, Ms. Taketatsu knows how to pout, Ms. Tsuda has the authoritative drive, and the two can moan when needed.(And a small shout-out to the talking hormones, condoms, and erections that supported the show in comedic fashion.)The rest of the original soundtrack remains the same as the first season. A light piano backs the romantic scenes and steps along for the sillier ones. And a nice acoustic guitar accompanies the quieter, simpler times.ENJOYMENTOnce again, I find myself conflicted over an anime.On the one hand, it’s frustrating to watch many of the scenes play out when they almost always conclude with some interruption or unnatural shove in the opposite direction. A lot of this interrupting and shoving derives from Rin, but Ui is no better when she fails to make any significant strides due to her odd choices. To be fair, Izumi is just as much at fault with everything as these two, but he at least has the excuse that he’s at their mercy most of the time.On the other hand, I like both girls. Ui has the caring personality that I find very attractive, and Rin has the bombshell looks that get my head turning. Ui made me laugh with her huge pouts, Rin had me smiling at her blushes, and the two together were no doubt arousing when it came to their ecchi escapades (even if they weren’t exactly novel).I want to like this one more than I do, but the anime makes it hard to do so. The show should just go all the way in one direction with either Rin or Ui. Enough of the back-and-forth, maybe-maybe-not wishy-washiness. Because the anime is cute and funny and arousing – but it just doesn’t know what it ultimately wants to be.Okusama ga Seitokaichou!+! ends up worse off than its previous season. Further deviation from its marriage motif, less animation, and not enough focus on Ui and Izumi are its biggest mistakes. Its art and music remain consistent, but it’s a show that one will part with long before death.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, constant refusal to let events play out and even more unnecessary “polygamy” entirely defeat the purpose of the narrativeAnimation: Fine, while less movement occurs, the uncensored material and the comedic portrayals keep the visuals both alluring and funCharacters: Terrible, Ui and Izumi’s relationship goes nowhere as they and those around them impede their progress without failSound: Fine, bad OP, okay ED, okay OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, Rin and Ui are likable, but having both together only makes things unlikableFinal Score: 3/10', 'It\'s a shame. Season 1 of Okusama ga Seito Kaichou was the ecchi to end all ecchi. The whole point of season 1 of this show was to just be that -- a simple, straightforward ecchi that was just entertaining, mindless trash. That\'s why I loved it.And then season 2 happened, and threw all that out the window. It tried to (*holds in vomit*) have a story.It turned into a show that tried to be what it wasn\'t: a story driven ecchi romance on par with other harems. This, in my opinion, was an utter failure. The specter and brilliance of plain, unadulterated ecchi was...completely lost when it tried to shift gears and have a real plot and (nonexistent) character development. It fell into the harem pitfall of ""oh, I guess this episode it\'s this girl\'s turn,"" while still maintaining the facade of having an overarching story.Season 1, in many ways, was even relatable. It embodied the horny nature of high schoolers while keeping the interactions realistic. Yes, the nature in which they began living together was unbelievable, but when it came down to it and they got horny on main, they would actually say fuck it and get steamy.I\'m so sad... what happened to the simplistic nature of season 1...?Do not watch this season, unless you\'re looking for a totally different kind of frustration. completely lost when it tried to shift gears and have a real plot and (nonexistent) character development.

(2016)Second full season and the last of the show it seems.The show is literally exactly the same as the first season and its OVA. The 'story' if anything gets worse. Not only is the male a cheat he is openly doing it and the girl is so naive because they are 'married' that it is fine. Again much of the student population seem to have a much better grasp of interpersonal relationships than the main cast with the exception of Honoka (Saijou).The only redeeming features we do get are three girls. Two from the first season actually involved now...and Honoka.Firstly, Honoka from the photography club because she actually seems to have knowledge of relationships and she is, therefore, a more normal person even if she lacks actual experience.Secondly, Ayane since she is pretty damn cute. Also, her advances in her episode made for a pretty funny scenario that showed her to be much more devious than you'd expect. Her episode also left a pretty big cliff hanger on what actually happens.Thirdly, Karen who is actually my favourite because she although does a lewd scenario in her episode is probably the only girl who is genuinely unsure of what is happening. Honoka has at least knowledge so can play along. Karen, however, is shy and feels unwanted by guys so she is much more innocent. She obviously acts very differently but that makes her a pretty good character.The art of consistent with the previous season and OVA. It doesn't change at all enough to really notice anything changing. Ecchi is still of the same standard and flows.Sound again is reused noises and generally OK sound. Ayane has a pretty damn cute voice still.Characters only develop in the way of the viewer seeing more of what is actually happening from each girls perspective. The worst development is just how naive Ui is and her acceptance of her 'husband' and his ways of using denial to cheat whether he is 100% complicit in it or not. He is a horn dog per se and she accepts it for some reason.In the end, it is still a pretty average show that has an awful plotline. It is not awful because of its a bad idea but because of how it is acted out. It really just sets you a scenario or the status quo like I have said and forgets itself. It would probably have done better as pure hentai, to be honest.The only interesting thing out of this would be to have a true ending. I honestly see this as a harem type ending that would be pretty brutal. The sort of ending where regardless of winners and losers everyone is a somewhat empty shell. It would be an interesting arc to follow if that is how it goes. I know that is not how it goes because I have read the manga which I can say honestly is better than the show. It is still a toxic situation that gets its lovey-dovey ending but it is what it is. and Honoka.Firstly, Honoka from the photography club because she actually seems to have knowledge of relationships and she is, therefore, a more normal person even if she lacks actual experience.Secondly, Ayane since she is pretty damn cute.

They are much less intimate this time around, shock horror.Besides this it's essentially more of the...same, so if the relationship between Hayato and Ui didn't interest you in the first place then you'll probably enjoy this season as much as you did the last. same, so if the relationship between Hayato and Ui didn't interest you in the first place then you'll probably enjoy this season as much as you did the last."", 'I feel that overall the story regressed significantly compared to season 1 where there was at least some progression in the relationship.In season2 it seems like they hit a big reset button and the whole season feels like it would have fit better between S1 episodes.The same premise as at the start of season1 is now the whole goal of season2 only it is now extended to all the other girls from the cast.Lets see how our MC deals with ""this"" girl that has lost her panties.I can say that where season1 felt like it was (slowly) developing the relationship vs marriage that...Hayato and Ui had, in season2 we only get very minor developments that are always put ""at risk"" but the next underwear loss.And also, here is a lot more jiggle in S2 and a lot more gratuity overall but thats not unexpected.My hope is that somewhere, sometime, a season3 will come and it will wrap up the series as well as the manga did.

It has a lot of ideas and it tries to do a lot of things, many of which could have worked: after all, it's basically 'Harry Potter', only darker and more violent. Unfortunately, every part of it is rushed, forced, and underdeveloped, practically perfunctory: watching an episode feels like reading a plot synopsis. It's an awkward mess from start to finish, entertainingly bad at times, but mostly just boring.It is immediately clear that the series is drastically abbreviating its written source material, and whatever appeal the original may possess,...little has survived this brutal treatment. It's like ordering a pizza and receiving a ball of dough, a slice of processed cheese, and a squashed tomato. Scenes play out as if the writer or the director were checking off plot points scribbled on a sticky note, with no added detail or depth.It's difficult to discuss 'Spellblades' without rewriting it scene by scene, because it does practically everything wrong. I will try to avoid doing that, but — well, for example, if you want to establish that a magic school is dangerous, you can introduce what we think is the protagonist of what appears to be a general fantasy action series, then subvert our expectations by having a magical plant devour him five minutes in. It's a bit more entertaining than having someone state that magic school is dangerous.A relatable protagonist is a solid foundation for a story, which is why 'Harry Potter' begins at home with Harry Potter. 'Spellblades' begins by rushing no fewer than six main characters into a fight scene. It makes the most important character less relatable by relegating much of his personality to a mysterious backstory to be revealed at some later date, which is problematic in a point-of-view character. Also, it's difficult to create a sense of mystery when the setting is so underdeveloped: we can't tell if a scene is intentionally confusing because of a mystery that hasn't been solved yet, or unintentionally confusing because the adaptation is missing some important detail.Having met on the first day of school, the main characters quickly become close friends. Anyone who ever lived in a college dorm can understand this formative experience of young adulthood and how the series has failed to capture it. I am not asking for literary realism: I am asking that they bond in a way that feels credible. Real life is often unrealistic. Real students can build a close friendship on a chance encounter in a stairwell at one in the morning, because real students are notoriously stupid. Wizarding students, on the other hand, are too busy self-seriously collecting plot points to have any formative experiences at all. I think one night of bad behaviour would go a long way toward humanizing them. Didn't Harry Potter use a cloak of invisibility to sneak his friends into bars? Let the edgy wizard boy date the goldfish-brained samurai girl. It doesn't have to be dark and mysterious: it can just be fun.As it stands, the tone is inconsistent: the series often attempts to be whimsical — easily detected in the soundtrack — but the characters, the setting, and the plot are really too dark for that. 'Harry Potter' meets the minimum threshold for whimsy because Harry Potter and friends are basically normal kids, not child soldiers; none of them has a death wish, not even Ron; and the Slytherins are bullies, not murderers.As for the violence, action scenes are fundamentally about character conflict; they are not necessarily violent. (The potato chip scene in 'Death Note' is a good example.) Violence without conflict is just spectacle: another pointless tournament arc. 'Spellblades' has plenty of violence but little conflict: many of the fight scenes serve no purpose, as the students are continually challenging one another merely to show off.The plot is practically impossible to spoil because it includes practically every fantasy trope and treats each of them with about as much detail and depth as a plot synopsis. None of its ideas are inherently bad: every good pizza begins with a ball of dough. The plot, the setting, and the characters could have worked: just rewrite every scene. Make the goldfish-brained samurai girl the protagonist: her backstory, her struggle, her growth — all of it has potential. I know you can make any story sound stupid by describing it in a stupid way, and I have tried to avoid doing that. So an elf and a troll fight bees with a werewolf: so what? 'Hamlet' had a ghost and a pirate ship, and it turned out fine. In every case, it is the execution that counts, and in this case — I mean 'Spellblades', not 'Hamlet' — the execution is perfunctory, wasting its potential.On the positive side, the series is morally inoffensive, exalting friendship, courage, traditional martial arts, and the ethical treatment of animals; in that respect, it's better than 'Black Lagoon'. I liked the kissing scene, the severed hand, and the barbecue guy. The last arc was watchable. The voice actors did the best they could with the material.All in all, 'Reign of the Seven Spellblades' is unfortunately quite bad. At times, it was entertainingly bad; looking back on the season as a whole, the edgy wizard kids, the goldfish-brained samurai, the slightly improved final arc, etc., I can even say that it was endearingly bad, so long as I do not have to rewatch any of it. I can recommend it as a case study in how not to tell a story, but I cannot recommend it as a fantasy series. little has survived this brutal treatment.

This isn't supposed to be the power of friendship and slice of life, it is supposed to be dark, gritty, and full of revenge. It was supposed to be deep but in the end, it is Harry Potter with more selfish characters. People hide their powers when it matters and you get a deep set of allies everywhere but they basically do nothing.One minute you get a deep backstory, see the targets, and get ready for some revenge and it was great but then suddenly it...goes back to the power of friendship and slice of life and nothing particular happens again. Even the finale builds up like it is going to be an epic battle but in the end, nothing really happens which is a real big shame.The art is average, the sound isn't bad and the characters are somewhat interesting just sort of lacking.If a season 2 came out with more of the dark stuff it hints about like it tries to in the final episode for all of a few seconds then fantastic. If not then it is just a fake story premise just like every other show in a school.3/10 in its current state. goes back to the power of friendship and slice of life and nothing particular happens again.

After watching so many new anime the last couple years that felt generic with cheap animation and boring characters.....I hoped that this anime would be a breath of fresh air. Weeeell........it misses the mark more than it connects.The animation quality is respectable. You can see a smoothness in how the characters move around in social environments or in fights. The art design for the characters are a mixed bag. Some characters have a generic look, but some look like the creator really tried to draw a unique person.For me, there are three critical negatives...that caused me to drop it after 6 episodes.1. ""Wait....who is this now/again?""       That\'s what you might think several times within 6 episodes. Besides the main characters, side characters get introduced and then taken off screen barely long enough for them to be introduced. These characters are shuffled around like musical chairs and it definitely feels odd. I think the ultimate problem is that the cast is too big too early and nobody is getting the screen time needed for you to really digest their presence in this show.2. The main characters are all together as one big friend group, despite being strangers 2 seconds earlier, for literally no good reason at all. I had to question why they were choosing to be together many times through 6 episodes, even before knowing each others\' names. It just feels VERY forced, lazy, and unrealistic(yes, I know it\'s an anime, but still.........)3. This is tying in with #1 and #2 regarding the big cast of characters. Nobody has any depth or character beyond the surface. I know that it\'s only 6 episodes so far....BUT somebody, anybody of the main cast should have a back story going on or a substantial clear motive that is reflective in how the show will end.Oliver Horn? a talented fighter.........that\'s about it as far as we really know.Hibiya? A very talented samurai whose hair changes white with a explanation from Oliver that will induce an eye rolling response.Michela? A girl that is fairly decent in being aware of situations around them.  Has some unexplored past with a side-character.Katie? An girl that loves different beings in the world and has a crush on OliverGuy? A SLIGHTLY thick headed guy.........nothing else.Pete? A tsundere who doesn\'t have a lot of magical background in his family.That\'s it. And somehow these main characters are connected at the hip with each from the word ""go"" . The side characters are even less explained or cared for.This anime has the pieces to potentially be good, even very good.............but the pieces are badly managed and halfway through this season(if it\'s 12 episodes) there is no improvement to be seen. that caused me to drop it after 6 episodes.1.

As an adaptation of the LN given a runtime of 15 episodes, it did a pretty nice job at what it was trying to do. That being said, it wasn\'t able to be as indulgent as the LN but what it does provide is enough to satisfy what it does cover in the story without leaving too many things undeveloped. That being said, the ""3 episode rule"" many people follow does this show a disservice. The suggested minimum episode...count for this show is 6 episodes. Watch that far and then make your decision, but it\'s definitely worth giving it a shot.Each of the members in the main group have their strengths and weaknesses. This becomes apparent as the show goes on and they have to solve various problems that come up. Everyone relevant gets enough background and definition in a timely manner before they become relevant, providing the proper introductions in ways that feel fluid to the narrative and doesn\'t break it up too much.The scenery and world leaves a lot to be discovered. There\'s a good amount of varied locations that the show visits despite being placed at a single academy. Many places get familiar, but not stale when returning to them multiple times throughout the duration of the show. It doesn\'t take long for the show to introduce one of the biggest reasons why there\'s so much for the students to explore, and leaves no doubts to them and the audience that exploration might be someone\'s downfall.They aren\'t afraid to pit peers against each other, and they talk about the school\'s 20% rate of mages being ""consumed by the spell"" which is a nice of way of saying that someone died from magical circumstances. That\'s also not something they treat lightly, the show has a dark undertone to start and without getting into spoiler territory, it doesn\'t go away and makes sure it\'s known to be there. They try to cover it up with the day to day circumstances but it still lingers on the edge of perception.The score is fantastic and at all times provides a proper atmosphere to the content being shown on the screen. Combat? Appropriately balanced brass and drums. Maybe some whirring strings in the mix. Minor mishap in class? Not overly dramatic yet still urgent flurry of notes. Day-to-day student interaction? Calm and collected background track. Both the opening and the ending songs are absolute perfection in musical composition for evoking the right feelings of wonder in both cases. Active curiosity and reflective pondering.The animation of the show is very pretty. The characters are expressive, the choreography is well done, and the motions of characters feel fluid and dynamic. The colors blend nicely, things don\'t stick out unless they\'re meant to, yet nobody fades into the background outside of the nameless characters that are part of the background. Even the actions taken by things like brooms and plants sfeel fitting and real. With all the very beautiful animation to see, it\'s a shame that this didn\'t particularly carry over into some of the magic. The spellcasting itself is great, the magic circles that appear around the wands and such blend nicely and fit into the scenes where they\'re present. After the spell cast though, most elemental spells and other adjacent categories feel rather mundane to see. There\'s a lot of effects for more specialized spells and even some of the spells that aren\'t orientated around combat feel ""magical"" in their own ways, yet some of the more common spells used that are still magic to the audience and should feel magical, just don\'t. It\'s not a particularly major thing, but it is somewhat noticeable.Unfortunately, on the more critical side, they did bite off a bit more than they could chew. 15 episodes was enough to get all they needed in, but it sits on the border of being too indulgent and not indulgent enough. This story is one that wants to be a 24 episode long haul so badly but it doesn\'t get that chance, and it\'s not often that a show ever comes out of the blue with that opportunity these days. Almost all of the shortcomings of Reign come from how the structural format of a show airing in 1 cour doesn\'t take well to the way a story like this wants to be paced and built up over time. If this show gets a season 2 then it will only benefit overall as it will have that time that it really wanted to shine.Overall, the show is a lot of fun and a balancing act of dark tones and day-to-day life in the magic academy. There\'s a lot to love here but still something to be desired. That being said, the 15 episodes that we got are satisfying on their own while still allowing for a continuation in the future. It\'s worth giving it a shot if you\'re not one for reading, get to episode 6 and make the decision.

Basically it means it does not worth anime makers  a single dime of their HARD WORK. So wasted of sklills from anime producers. We as a viewers should boycott this kind of bullshit.

So disappointed.', ""Interesting premise and good animation had me excited to watch this anime this season.This anime however greatly disappoints. Eight episodes in and feel no connection with any character nor any interest in any character, the reason is simple too, the show has offered nothing substantial to grasp onto, the primary protagonist has a bit of a mystery surrounding who he really is but is kept very hidden even from the viewer to where I question why even bother with it at all.The show is about a 7th powerful magic yet only the 6 have been slightly mentioned as of episode 8...Maybe 2 story arcs have...happened thus far?

Visually is fantastic, and the sound effects/music are top notch. Based on just those two elements its a hard 9/10, unfortunately regarding everything else the show just falls flat on its face.The plot is a jumbled mess, the flow is awful, almost like it was written to air as 1hr episodes but later changed so episodes start and end in weird spots in relation to the story, and the plot points where they clearly want me to become emotionally attached to a character just feel forced fed. The...show just feels like it was designed by someone purely as a cash grab instead of writing a good compelling story. Not that making money is a bad thing, I 100% understand a studio/writer/artist wanting to make profit on their work. However far to often shows made this way just feel off.It’s like they took all the qualities of successful anime, added a splash of “The Harry Potter game is popular right now” and threw it in a blender, and while its made with quality ingredients the finished product just feels void of personality and honestly fake. show just feels like it was designed by someone purely as a cash grab instead of writing a good compelling story.

Initially, I found myself captivated by the trailers and intrigued by its synopsis. However, the pilot episode fell considerably short of my expectations, although I believed it warranted further viewing. While the character designs generally met an acceptable standard, the dialogue, already noticeably tedious, failed to consistently engage me. Moreover, the musical accompaniment often failed to sync effectively with the prevailing atmosphere. This departure from ideal harmonization was somewhat anticipated for a debut episode, akin to the early stages of other animes I have come to appreciate, such as ""Black Clover,""...which exhibited initial roughness. The pacing of the show felt conspicuously irregular, resembling the fluctuating speeds of a child toggling between 2x and 0.5x playback throughout the entirety of the episode. Yet, the animation quality offered a degree of respite from this peculiarity. However, my reservations deepened considerably upon the introduction of the principal character\'s discourse. This juncture prompted the emergence of significant skepticism regarding the show, as it appeared plagued by glaring plot holes and transgressions against cohesive world-building. Thoughts such as ""Why would someone who can\'t use magic be admitted to a school specifically meant for magic?"" ""What self-respecting principal of a prestigious school would outright flaunt the death rate of her school?"" ""why would parents or the government even continue to support such a school?"" lingered in my mind. These ruminations persisted throughout the remainder of the episode, prompting an incessant inclination within me to disengage mentally. Despite my initial assessment of the episode as mediocre overall, I committed to persevere and continue watching. Regrettably, as you will subsequently discern, this would prove to be a mistake.Plot [1.3/10]:Having watched four episodes from beginning to end, I find myself unable to provide a coherent depiction of the overarching plot\'s trajectory. The disordered pacing within the narrative serves to obstruct the comprehension of any particular scene. This lack of clarity is further exacerbated by sudden occurrences of events that are devoid of prior buildup and explained poorly, resulting in a profoundly confusing storyline.For instance, we are abruptly transported from a scene where characters are partaking in a meal at a dining table to an unforeseen entrapment within a labyrinth. In this sequence, an incredibly lust-driven, lunatic senior student is accompanied by a corpse-harvesting senior student, whose appearance resembles that of a middle-aged man, and they proceed to corner the main cast. Bizarrely, a sequence of insults culminates in the improbable emergence of a Kaiju, birthed by the magically aforementioned horny senior, and another one fashioned from dungeon bones created by the senior student who’s appearance contradicted his age.Moreover, a puzzling inconsistency arises wherein students are expressly prohibited from engaging in fighting each other without the employment of protective spells. Nevertheless, instances materialize where students openly challenge one another to clandestine underground duels or unabashedly launch assaults without apparent repercussions. One of these times, a rather cocky student extends a challenge to the main character, proposing a duel set to unfold within the confines of an underground colosseum. As night descends, the anticipated confrontation without warning, transforms into a hunting competition. But an even more bewildering twist comes in the form of jojo’s part 3 magician’s red cameo, who emerges suddenly and embarks on a spree of indiscriminate student casualties. It is noteworthy that in a prior instance, a student prefect was conveniently present to safeguard students from my prior example. Curiously, this vigilant intervention was conspicuously absent when the student body faced the genocidal bird-man. But In spite of this great tragedy, there were no formal apologies or changes to the school the next day, beyond the students clamoring as if they were wholly unaware that countless students got brutally massacred. Its narrative tries to portray the school as fair and lawful, but somewhat dangerous, but what it shows instead is a hellscape, unfit for study or even living.Collectively, the plot evokes a semblance akin to that of ""Family Guy,"" characterized by its constant interjection of scenarios, yet lacks the comedic element, instead playing itself completely seriously. It feels like every moment I watch this show, I am met with very slow and arduous scenes that are then abruptly cut to another that is bizarre and edgy to the maximum for just sheer shock value and it seems to have no repercussions to the school setting so it resembles a monster a week type story, well I cant even give it that much credit, as it plays out sort of like the Pokémon anime where there is very little acknowledgment of the prior episode, rather than having a consistent canon.Setting [2/10]:In addition to the issues elucidated within the plot section, this section will be a little shorter. There is no effective worldbuilding, foreshadowing, and coherent setup within the narrative. An evident lack of interconnectivity and contextualization pervades the storytelling, resulting in a disjointed portrayal of events. The school\'s design appears to draw inspiration from Harry Potter\'s Hogwarts, but it lacks the magical charm and distinctive places that make Hogwarts special. Here, all you have are generic locations you would expect in a magic school but without any lore or interesting features to make it feel lived-in. Instead, we encounter generic magical spots that lack depth or interesting features. Then you have the labyrinth in which the school was unwisely but purposefully built over for unknown reasons that endanger the many students, which calls into question the principals statement of ""your life and death are in your hands"" when the very building in which they study and sleep in is essentially a death trap, we see bones littered throughout the labyrinth insinuating that no student who had died had ever been ceremoniously buried with respect or even bothered to be recovered despite prefects (senior students, and not specially trained adults) being stationed, the institutions spares no resource to even let the unfortunate families hold a funeral for or even see their child.The narrative\'s depiction of these settings is cursory at best, neglecting to furnish pertinent details regarding their interconnectedness, spatial relationships, or navigational logistics. Astonishingly, the student body appears to effortlessly traverse the sprawling expanse of the school without any apparent logistical hindrances, a conspicuous incongruity considering its considerable magnitude.In summary, the “school” is a morbid and anomalous human meat grinder built upon a glorified mass-grave. The absence of meticulous world-building efforts and the omission of vital particulars, such as geographical orientation and the mechanics of movement, contribute to an overall portrayal that lacks any cohesion and fails to foster an immersive narrative experience.Characters [1/10]:Having just described the insanity that is the setting, we rightfully need to populate it with the most perverse, ignorant and unacceptable characters imaginable. To start, the character designs can be deemed passable, without any particularly remarkable or exceptional attributes. While some characters, like Nanao, are more pleasing to the eye, others, including the main character Oliver, are mundane and generic. The crux of the issues, however, resides within the character\'s writing and portrayal. It can be asserted with certainty that each character within the narrative is either ensnared within a dichotomy of uninspiring banality and clichéd triteness, or they are entangled within an unfortunate embrace of exaggerated edginess and imprudent impracticality.A recurrent pattern unfolds across episodes, wherein audiences are inundated with introductions to a plethora of nondescript peripheral characters, each flaunting a solitary noteworthy trait engineered either for gratuitous shock value or for the sole purpose of cultivating annoyance. This predicament remains further compounded by the lackluster protagonists themselves. Their motivations for enrolling within such a perilous institution are shrouded in ambiguity, with scant justifications beyond the vague notion of seeking new experiences or acquiring knowledge, often absent in practical execution, in fact, no one seems to realize the dangers they are constantly in, you would expect death-school students to be more competent, hardened and interesting, essentially characters that are just waiting to write themselves into existence, but the author seems more interested in reusing the ignorant and banal mannequins seen in most anime that feature a magic academy.The dialogue employed within the series is disappointingly bereft of cogency and coherence. The narrative often succumbs to abrupt leaps in logic, inundating viewers with an amalgamation of trite humor, contrived jesting, irksome incongruities, and perhaps the driest and most unmotivated humor that will leave you at your wits end. For instance, a pivotal instance involving Oliver and Nanao partaking in a swordsmanship exercise culminates in an inexplicable shift from mutual respect to an irrationally pronounced intent to lethally engage one another. This unusual character motivation is elucidated by Nanao\'s perplexing proclivity to associate death with love, which in turn results in her subsequent disposition toward self-destructive tendencies. But this is immediately contradicted by her flashback to a time when she was still in her home country, where that philosophy appears to not exist at all.Furthermore, the pacing narrative of the show oscillates erratically between sluggish monotony during mundane conversations, emblematic of a snail\'s languid crawl, and a frenetic, near-breathless tempo during intense combat sequences. A notably vexatious character, Katie, is purportedly an advocate for animal and magical creature rights but she is shown to have no aptitude in anything whatsoever, which subsequently is consistently cast into the role of a distressed damsel, perpetually rescued by her peers. This portrayal, regrettably, undermines her ostensibly compassionate disposition. In a pronounced departure from logical coherence, her presence at a school that openly condones animal subjugation through a conspicuous parade on the inaugural day remains an inexplicably unresolved enigma. This absence of congruence underscores a prevailing tendency wherein characters appear to inhabit their roles merely to fulfill designated slots, devoid of genuine purpose or narrative propulsion.Each character within the narrative seemingly adheres to rudimentary stereotypes, enshrining them within a rigidly one-dimensional framework. The overarching impression is that of a checklist hastily assembled by the author, failing to furnish characters with any semblance of depth or complexity. Even pivotal figures, such as Guy Greenwood, a central protagonist, are rendered insubstantial, their identity reduced to mere surface-level attributes with a conspicuous dearth of substantive characterization. This narrative impoverishment is further illustrated by the inclusion of psychopathic individuals endowed with the preposterous ability to birth Kaijus, and educators who blatantly inflict torture upon students without incurring any semblance of retribution.In summation, a pervasive pallor of shallowness, monotony, and banality permeates each character portrayal, collectively yielding a composition rife with generic attributes that ultimately fail to resonate with discerning audiences seeking multifaceted and captivating personas.Art [6.8/10]:The artistic direction encompassed by this series exhibits a spectrum ranging from impressive to middling. Particularly commendable is the animation quality evident in the dynamic action sequences, which captivate with their fluidity and precision. Equally noteworthy are the intricately rendered backgrounds, which contribute to the visual depth of each scene. Notably, the fight with the Garuda is strikingly choreographed and effectively captured through thoughtful camerawork, despite facing certain inconsistencies. These deviations are exemplified by Nanao\'s unexpected ability to decapitate the Garuda, a development that contradicts previous declarations pertaining to her blade\'s absence of an edge.The magic although not grounded or explained well, is a common occurrence in the genre but looks stylistically pleasing nonetheless.  The series\' visual strengths are, however, tempered by interludes of monotony inherent to the storyline, alongside intermittent lapses in meticulous detail.Taken in totality, the series\' artistic direction emerges as respectable, with its laudable components somewhat counterbalanced by the story\'s inherent limitations. Despite these inherent shortcomings, the series manages to maintain a satisfactory level of visual quality, ultimately contributing to a viewing experience that can be deemed decent in the broader context.Music [5.7/10]:The musical accompaniment, while adequately reflective of the narrative\'s backdrop, regrettably lacks emotional resonance. Although ostensibly aligned with the setting, its utilization often falters, resulting in a disjointed integration within certain segments of each episode. Collectively, the musical score\'s impact is unremarkable, albeit not egregiously subpar. It would have been apt to categorize it as mediocre, were it not for the frequent misalignment between the music\'s tonalities and the scenes they underscore. This recurrent misjudgment slightly diminishes its overall quality from middling to a somewhat less favorable evaluation.Verdict:Every single episode feels like it\'s trying to fit a filler story within a bigger filler story, reminiscent of those nested Russian dolls. The result is an incredibly disappointing and cringeworthy watch that leaves you wondering why you invested your time in the first place. This repetitive pattern of unfulfilling content manages to taint the entire viewing experience, evoking a strong sense of repulsion and frustration that\'s hard to shake off, long after the credits roll. If you have an ounce of self-respect give this show a pass. which exhibited initial roughness. The pacing of the show felt conspicuously irregular, resembling the fluctuating speeds of a child toggling between 2x and 0.5x playback throughout the entirety of the episode. Yet, the animation quality offered a degree of respite from this peculiarity. However, my reservations deepened considerably upon the introduction of the principal character\'s discourse. This juncture prompted the emergence of significant skepticism regarding the show, as it appeared plagued by glaring plot holes and transgressions against cohesive world-building. Thoughts such as ""Why would someone who can\'t use magic be admitted to a school specifically meant for magic?"" ""What self-respecting principal of a prestigious school would outright flaunt the death rate of her school?"" ""why would parents or the government even continue to support such a school?"" lingered in my mind. These ruminations persisted throughout the remainder of the episode, prompting an incessant inclination within me to disengage mentally. Despite my initial assessment of the episode as mediocre overall, I committed to persevere and continue watching. Regrettably, as you will subsequently discern, this would prove to be a mistake.Plot [1.3/10]:Having watched four episodes from beginning to end, I find myself unable to provide a coherent depiction of the overarching plot\'s trajectory. The disordered pacing within the narrative serves to obstruct the comprehension of any particular scene. This lack of clarity is further exacerbated by sudden occurrences of events that are devoid of prior buildup and explained poorly, resulting in a profoundly confusing storyline.For instance, we are abruptly transported from a scene where characters are partaking in a meal at a dining table to an unforeseen entrapment within a labyrinth. In this sequence, an incredibly lust-driven, lunatic senior student is accompanied by a corpse-harvesting senior student, whose appearance resembles that of a middle-aged man, and they proceed to corner the main cast. Bizarrely, a sequence of insults culminates in the improbable emergence of a Kaiju, birthed by the magically aforementioned horny senior, and another one fashioned from dungeon bones created by the senior student who’s appearance contradicted his age.Moreover, a puzzling inconsistency arises wherein students are expressly prohibited from engaging in fighting each other without the employment of protective spells. Nevertheless, instances materialize where students openly challenge one another to clandestine underground duels or unabashedly launch assaults without apparent repercussions. One of these times, a rather cocky student extends a challenge to the main character, proposing a duel set to unfold within the confines of an underground colosseum. As night descends, the anticipated confrontation without warning, transforms into a hunting competition. But an even more bewildering twist comes in the form of jojo’s part 3 magician’s red cameo, who emerges suddenly and embarks on a spree of indiscriminate student casualties. It is noteworthy that in a prior instance, a student prefect was conveniently present to safeguard students from my prior example. Curiously, this vigilant intervention was conspicuously absent when the student body faced the genocidal bird-man. But In spite of this great tragedy, there were no formal apologies or changes to the school the next day, beyond the students clamoring as if they were wholly unaware that countless students got brutally massacred. Its narrative tries to portray the school as fair and lawful, but somewhat dangerous, but what it shows instead is a hellscape, unfit for study or even living.Collectively, the plot evokes a semblance akin to that of ""Family Guy,"" characterized by its constant interjection of scenarios, yet lacks the comedic element, instead playing itself completely seriously. It feels like every moment I watch this show, I am met with very slow and arduous scenes that are then abruptly cut to another that is bizarre and edgy to the maximum for just sheer shock value and it seems to have no repercussions to the school setting so it resembles a monster a week type story, well I cant even give it that much credit, as it plays out sort of like the Pokémon anime where there is very little acknowledgment of the prior episode, rather than having a consistent canon.Setting [2/10]:In addition to the issues elucidated within the plot section, this section will be a little shorter. There is no effective worldbuilding, foreshadowing, and coherent setup within the narrative. An evident lack of interconnectivity and contextualization pervades the storytelling, resulting in a disjointed portrayal of events. The school\'s design appears to draw inspiration from Harry Potter\'s Hogwarts, but it lacks the magical charm and distinctive places that make Hogwarts special. Here, all you have are generic locations you would expect in a magic school but without any lore or interesting features to make it feel lived-in. Instead, we encounter generic magical spots that lack depth or interesting features. Then you have the labyrinth in which the school was unwisely but purposefully built over for unknown reasons that endanger the many students, which calls into question the principals statement of ""your life and death are in your hands"" when the very building in which they study and sleep in is essentially a death trap, we see bones littered throughout the labyrinth insinuating that no student who had died had ever been ceremoniously buried with respect or even bothered to be recovered despite prefects (senior students, and not specially trained adults) being stationed, the institutions spares no resource to even let the unfortunate families hold a funeral for or even see their child.The narrative\'s depiction of these settings is cursory at best, neglecting to furnish pertinent details regarding their interconnectedness, spatial relationships, or navigational logistics. Astonishingly, the student body appears to effortlessly traverse the sprawling expanse of the school without any apparent logistical hindrances, a conspicuous incongruity considering its considerable magnitude.In summary, the “school” is a morbid and anomalous human meat grinder built upon a glorified mass-grave. The absence of meticulous world-building efforts and the omission of vital particulars, such as geographical orientation and the mechanics of movement, contribute to an overall portrayal that lacks any cohesion and fails to foster an immersive narrative experience.Characters [1/10]:Having just described the insanity that is the setting, we rightfully need to populate it with the most perverse, ignorant and unacceptable characters imaginable. To start, the character designs can be deemed passable, without any particularly remarkable or exceptional attributes. While some characters, like Nanao, are more pleasing to the eye, others, including the main character Oliver, are mundane and generic. The crux of the issues, however, resides within the character\'s writing and portrayal. It can be asserted with certainty that each character within the narrative is either ensnared within a dichotomy of uninspiring banality and clichéd triteness, or they are entangled within an unfortunate embrace of exaggerated edginess and imprudent impracticality.A recurrent pattern unfolds across episodes, wherein audiences are inundated with introductions to a plethora of nondescript peripheral characters, each flaunting a solitary noteworthy trait engineered either for gratuitous shock value or for the sole purpose of cultivating annoyance. This predicament remains further compounded by the lackluster protagonists themselves. Their motivations for enrolling within such a perilous institution are shrouded in ambiguity, with scant justifications beyond the vague notion of seeking new experiences or acquiring knowledge, often absent in practical execution, in fact, no one seems to realize the dangers they are constantly in, you would expect death-school students to be more competent, hardened and interesting, essentially characters that are just waiting to write themselves into existence, but the author seems more interested in reusing the ignorant and banal mannequins seen in most anime that feature a magic academy.The dialogue employed within the series is disappointingly bereft of cogency and coherence.

Yet with all that edge there are almost no good points to be found.If you came looking for a good anime Harry Potter with swords I can at least guarantee you most of that statement is true, just not the ""good"" part. The show is every bit as shallow, cliche, and needlessly grimdark-edgy as one might expect any random mid-late 2000s Harry Potter fanfic to be. In fact I would honestly be more surprised to learn that this show *wasn\'t* actually just someone\'s Harry Potter...fanfic they wrote back in highschool when they still thought edgy meant deep. But enough dunking on the whole, let\'s waste some time trying to make sense of the parts.Characters - 1/10 (a point for each dimension they collectively have...)We\'ve got the kirito one, the suicidal samurai one, the noblewoman one, the dumb jock one, the nerd one, and the animal lover one. That single sentence just did about as much to characterize our main cast as 4 episodes of the show. The only other characterization for them is that they\'re all mary sues: they are all always right and anyone who dislikes them or disagrees with them is wrong and a horrible person. Speaking of people who dislike them, they\'re all stereotypical idiot bullies who get easily one-upped the second kirito or suicidal samurai draw their swords (at least half of the main cast exists purely to be protected by our lead duo after all). There are also some obnoxious teachers and some upperclassmen with weird fetishes, but none of them have done anything remotely important.Plot - 3/10 (placeholder score until a main plot actually happens)We\'ve got 6 kids at sword hogwarts studying magic and swords. There\'s not really anything resembling a main plot yet, just some B plot about troll rights. The lack of any main plot is itself not a problem for now, as the core concept of ""kids go to sword hogwarts"" is more than interesting enough to keep engagement for a while, but the mini episodic plots so far have all been incredibly contrived and cliche to the point where I have almost no faith the eventual main plot will be anything better than bad. Oh and don\'t forget: if you or someone you know is depressed/suicidal, just tell the person to stop feeling that way and the problem will instantly be solved (/s).Worldbuilding - 1/10 (How did you fail this horribly this quickly?)Harry potter with swords. This should be a free 7/10 or better, except in the same breath we explain the concept in the story we immediately undermine it. ""We use swords because one time a mage got beat by a non-mage with a sword because magic is bad at close range. Also when you fight with a sword don\'t forget you can use fast-casting stun/confusion spells which are exceptional for close quarters combat."" Seriously, that\'s (paraphrased) actually how it went. There are also other issues with how the school is run and how we see magic being used in the world, but it\'s much easier to just point and laugh at immediately invalidating the argument for using swords.Music - 7/10? (I haven\'t been paying enough attention tbh)Fairly certain the OST at least sets a pretty solid mood and fits the show well. I\'m honestly too focused on how terrible the writing is 99% of the time to notice it so it\'s at least not bad.Animation - 8/10 (it\'s honestly just good.)For as terrible as the writing is, at least the show looks good. We\'ve had at least one strong action scene now that was genuinely entertaining enough to make me forget how much I hated how we got to the fight and how the fight was probably going to (and actually did) resolve. I feel bad for the animators, because they deserve to work on better shows than this dumpsterfire.Edginess - 2000s punk rock/10 (wakemeupinside)Unless the mortality rate of mages who don\'t go to school is somehow higher than 20%, I can\'t see a single reason why anyone should accept the existence of a school where so many people constantly get crippled or die. Then we have suicidal samurai... Then we have people willfully abusing other sentient beings because they are ""resources to be exploited"" yet also seeming to revel in the fact they are being immoral... Then we have kirito... So far the least edgy things in this show have been the swords, because those apparently are dulled normally for student duels so they don\'t kill each other in class.Conclusion: Honestly, if you really want as much edge as this show wants to give, you should just go listen to some Linkin Park or MCR. I guarantee you anything they have put out is better written and more enjoyable. If you want harry potter fanfic, maybe just go dig through AO3. If you want something to hate-watch, welcome to the club, our support group meets at 9pm on Saturdays.I\'d rate this show even lower, but I feel bad for the non-writing artists involved in the production.Edit after episode 6: I genuinely hope the people saying ""it gets really good"" weren\'t referring to the events in this episode. Or maybe I do because at least then I can understand how they fooled themselves into thinking mindless edge is ""good"" somehow?

Enjoyable to watch, but ratings seem to be rather conflicted due to many upset novel readers. Overall, as someone who never read the source material, the show did fine in terms of storytelling even if bits felt rather fast. Ultimately, one of the downfalls of this story came down to pacing issues which was much to do with covering too much too quickly.It was fun to watch and made me invested enough to start reading the light novel.I wouldn't consider the negative reviews too heavily when deciding upon this as the animation quality is rather...high and seems to have been completely ignored. high and seems to have been completely ignored."", 'I discovered this anime by chance; the image piqued my interest, reminding me a bit of the vibes from ""Eminence in Shadow."" Unfortunately, I\'m already nearing the end of this first season of 15 episodes, and I don\'t feel any attachment to any of the characters. The story\'s introduction is non-existent, and I simply feel like I\'m watching episodes that contribute absolutely nothing, and this happens with every episode. I had to wait until episode 6 to finally be introduced to a bit of the story, but since then, the anime has once again veered off into things that are completely irrelevant to the plot.I...believe the premise isn\'t inherently bad from what I\'ve learned so far, but the execution of the series is very poorly done.

So I don't know what this show is trying to be. Character-wise, there are only 2-3 good main characters and the others are practically pointless so far into the show. They get their arc/screen time then we see a lot of things happen that ultimately have no purpose in the grand scheme of the story. It makes you wonder, why are there so many main characters when this show only needs 2-3 at most and a couple of important side characters.Plot-wise, well. There...is no plot. We've explored the world so far, and the magic system but there's no clear-cut goal or objective that our characters are trying to achieve. There is something going on behind the scenes that I'm not going to spoil, but that's not the main plot of the story right now. So it makes watching the show a drag, because why are we even watching this? What makes it worse, is that the show tries to get our attention by making side characters oppose our main characters for really no reason at all. I mean, we see more of the world when they oppose the main characters, but nothing those side characters do have any impact on the story.  It's only a minor conflict that gets brushed over after an episode or two, and then it rinses and repeats because there is no overarching plot in this show.The main weakness of Nanatsu no Maken ga Shihai suru is that it has too many main characters and lacks an identity. It would make sense if this is all one big prologue for next season, but it's still kind of boring because the 'good' characters are below average, and the other ones are bland. At the pace the story is going right now, it's very likely this season is just one big prologue building up to season 2 where we'll see some overarching plot conflict, good character development, and world-building. And if that's the case, I believe the story could've started around episode 5 or 6, instead of focusing on the other characters that just act as placeholders and nothing else. But we're only 9/13 episodes into the season, so maybe everyone will have stronger development and roles as the story progresses.That being said, the art, animation, and music are all good.

All I describe is to this point, so some things points I raise may not hold true at the point the show ends.It starts relatively well, with a cast of 6 characters who are all relatively distinct from each other who just happen to stand together when going to their new school. It's trying to be edgy from the start so the school is introduced as a dangerous scary school, which isn't really that convincing because it seems magic can just be dangerous in general, who would have thought. Back to...the characters, we have:1. Oliver, the MC. He's basically OP at everything and knows everything and has no reason to be there, but he's just a beginner like the rest. It's obvious that he has a somewhat different motivation for going to this school, so you might think he can either explain his reasoning to his friends when they explain how they got there. Or it's a secret, and he has to hide his knowledge and power! Well, neither is the case, because what would be the point in writing a MC if he isn't also Op and dark an mysterious? Yep, this guy is my biggest issue with the show. Think of Kirito from SAO, but edgier and cheesier at the same time, and with an even flatter face.2. Nanao, the samurai girl from not-Japan who doesn't fit into the setting at all, but everyone thinks she's cool and awesome because she's so good at sword fighting (did I mention she's a samurai?) She's a bit stupid but goes toe to toe with the MC even though she doesn't use magic. She also has some issues, but don't worry, they get resolved with basically no effort whatsoever.3. Michela, aka. Seth McFarlane, the eloquent paragon of, well, everything. Like Oliver, she seems to know everything and everyone already, and has an almost uncanny emotional competence. Not much more to say about her, despite her talents she mostly keeps herself back a little compared to the former two.4. Guy, the guy of the group. Typical male side character really, just a bro. To throw in some extra character, he's also good with plants or something, idk. He and the next two don't really contribute a whole lot, because the plot mainly focuses on making Oliver and Nanao look cool.5. Katie, the sweet female side character. Along with Guy, she gets about the least attention, but she's a neat plot device because of her love for animals and demihumans (meaning humanoid monsters), which causes her to become a damsel in distress from time to time.6. Pete, who's different from the rest of the characters by the detail that he isn't incredibly nice and quite frankly intrusive with the five random strangers he just met. He's also small and nerdy so his schtick is that he humiliates himself all the time. After they all magically become best friends, he's the tsundere of the group.With these descriptions, you already know 80% of what's goin on, because they don't get any deeper than that. The characters are basically cliches with somewhat nice designs (except Oliver and Katie, would it have killed them to make the MC look less like the regulard fantasy MC?). This unfortunately goes also for dialogues and fighting scenes, they're predictable to the point where you'd think they're just copypasted from any other works. Resulting from that is a relatively harmonious group dynamic, but the cost is a somewhat schizophrenic Oliver who can't seem to decide whether he wants to be a mysterious edgelord who doesn't care what the mean teachers say, or a fun-loving dude who just wants to help his friends. I guess his character would make a bit more sense if these were people he knew for years, but as I mentioned, they all just met for theri first year in school together.Enough of that, to the story. It starts off as a slice-of-lifey anime in this new magical school where the cast goes to classes and struggles with teachers and upperclassmen, with not much connections or a greater red thread being shown except the troll from the beginning, sorta kinda, I can't tell to be honest. We get introduced to the magical labyrinth that lies under the school, where students apparently hang out to torture and kill each other, but not in a too serious way. The rules aren't entirely clear, supposedly it spreads when the sun sets, but there are also portals and for being a labyrinth, the side characters seem to be able to navigate it just fine when the plot demands it (which is always, really. The fact that it's a labyrinth doesn't really come up after the first time we see it). We also learn about the spell blades, which are extremely rare and secret and strong fighting techniques that make the user pretty much undefeatable, and that's about it.In episode 6, we finally see a plot twist, surprise suprise, the MC is actually in the school for his extremely edgy revenge plot! Guess you couldn't have seen that one comming! So he mumbles a bit about his extremely tragic backstory, kills his foe and goes through an extremely weird and cringy ceremony with his siblings and cult followers, and then... the plot goes back to normal. Yep, it's like the scene never happened. Now, I didn't particularly like that episode, it was way over the top and the seemed like compensating for the very much not dark storytelling so far in this supposedly dangerous and merciless school. So instead of making it believable, shady, and most of all interesting, the writer just opted to turn the teachers from COMICALLY evil to comically EVIL out of nowhere, and I can#t take that seriously in all honesty. I don't want to be mean or anything, the whole show wasn't great so far, but there was some though in it, but suddenly it felt the animation studio accidentally put a fanfiction written by a child in the script instead of a regular chapter. Think about it: the self-insert main character suddenly becomes this all-powerfull and fights for revenge against his evil teachers. I couldn't come up with a better strawman of a story to mock emo kids.Anyway, the fact that it really goes nowhere and the interactions become so boring made me decide to drop it, even if the plot was continued in the following 7 episodes, my hopes are low, and my brain can only handle so much embarresment the characters, we have:1.

The animation itself is okay but the art style and character designs are generic and bad. The anime bills itself as kind of anime Harry Potter but has no interesting characters and...a dull story.

Lots of seemingly nuanced combat and power systems that would later be explored or explained. And more!What caught my attention was how they described their swordplay in tempos since only people who have actually done sword sports will have probably ever heard the terms before. I was waiting for them to start describing the...difference between probing actions and committing actions, and utilizing multi-tempo or chained actions into dynamic distance situations in off-tempo manners, but they never delved that deep into the swordplay. And that made me sad. Everything they seemed they seemed to be building up to got tossed to the wayside to make space for crap. So much crap in fact that they had to extend the show by 3 episodes to fit it all in.I had high hopes when it seemed like the writer had done their research and built an interesting enough world and cast. But by the halfway point it became apparent they had done just enough research to make it seem interesting and sophisticated but not actually be anything more than a somewhat poorly written fantasy story with plot lines pulled seemingly at random to whatever sounds good at the moment. An over-arching plot line is created along with some possible interesting character interactions and relationships, and that gets shoved to the side for a crappy generic plot line that cant seem to even keep it\'s story elements properly in place.I\'m more disappointed in how good this show and story could have been if the writer had spent more time developing the main storyline and combat system than chasing shit storylines and characters that really only serve to distract from how poorly crafted everything actually is.I\'d still watch it since I can pretend the last 11 episodes never happened, but that might not be what everyone else will enjoy.6/10 since it is entertaining at times, but honestly deserves a 3/10 for poor execution and crushing my dreams of having an anime with well-explained swordplay difference between probing actions and committing actions, and utilizing multi-tempo or chained actions into dynamic distance situations in off-tempo manners, but they never delved that deep into the swordplay.

As a setting, the anime adopts a Harry Potter-like magic school where all is rosy during the day and all hell breaks loose in the unseen parts at night. The reason I watch this anime is that the characters to be avenged are serious characters, unlike those in The Rising Of The Shield Hero. These characters are the teachers and the headmistress of the school; especially the headmistress, I got the impression of an Esdeath-like super-powered, monstrous female character. But the anime has 3 major downsides: The prologue is a bit...long (6 episodes), the seemingly unnecessary large cast of protagonists, and enough episodes are spent on the insignificant problems of these characters to push the revenge plot to the background, and the characters are written superficially like their problems. These side plots continue even in the finale, and I think this is the main factor that wastes the potential of the anime. long (6 episodes), the seemingly unnecessary large cast of protagonists, and enough episodes are spent on the insignificant problems of these characters to push the revenge plot to the background, and the characters are written superficially like their problems.

For example, he would say something like ""don\'t let your emotions control you"" to one of his friends. Yet, the literally in the same episode do the very thing he said was dumb to do.

Way too predictable and the show likes to make very bad guy be accepted as good because the MCs of the show are just too nice.

Tropey, shallow, and there is hardely any backstory to flesh them out.

The Story overall is pretty much nothing since all but a quarter of an episode focuses on the plot. It\'s almost entirely filler. The pace of the filler is decent, but still makes the show crawl by given the fact it\'s filler. The voice acting is grating, and emotionless. The casting is basically whoever could do the job the cheapest. The soundtrack is actually decent, but not scored well. Every scene is this dramatic music that almost never fits.

The echoes of J.K.

The visuals lack the innovative flair that could have elevated the series to a higher standard within the anime genre. Though serviceable, the animation fails to leave a lasting impression.The central theme of a dangerous school promises a dark and gritty narrative, but...the execution falters, leaving viewers yearning for a more profound and immersive experience. The show fails to deliver on the potential intensity of its premise, missing opportunities to explore the darker aspects of magic education.One notable drawback is the protagonist\'s overly encyclopedic knowledge, which diminishes the tension and stakes of the narrative. A well-rounded character should face challenges and grow, but when the lead character already possesses an extensive understanding of the magical world, it limits the potential for character development and the sense of jeopardy.The inclusion of themes such as animal cruelty, transgender issues, and class inequality attempts to add depth to the narrative. While commendable for addressing important societal topics, the execution lacks finesse, often feeling forced and disconnected from the main plot. These themes, rather than enhancing the story, seem like checkboxes that the series aims to mark off without delving into their complexities.The show\'s ultimate downfall lies in its failure to achieve the darkness it aspired to convey.

It\'s one of those hidden gems that give off a nostalgic ""Harry Potter"" vibe, and I absolutely love it for that reason. Having read the manga, I noticed a few changes, but they didn\'t detract from the overall experience. In fact, some surprises here and there kept things fresh and exciting.First things first, the art and background in this anime are top-notch, boasting a crisp and visually stunning animation style. What\'s even more impressive is the absence of CGI, which makes it all...the more enjoyable. The character designs are on point, and I have to admit, I\'m particularly drawn to Nanao Hibiya. Her backstory is intriguing, and she has all the qualities of waifu material.Speaking of characters, the main cast of six offers a diverse and intriguing bunch. We\'ve delved into Nanao Hibiya\'s backstory so far, and it\'s likely that we\'ll get to explore the others as the story unfolds. Each character brings something unique to the table, making the interactions and development all the more engaging.The music fits the fantasy genre perfectly and blends seamlessly with the anime\'s atmosphere. It\'s evident that the creators put thought into selecting the right tunes, enhancing the overall experience.In conclusion, this anime has won me over with its fantastic art, intriguing characters, and a well-composed soundtrack. If you\'re into magic and fantasy adventures, don\'t miss out on ""Nanatsu no Maken ga Shihai suru."" This isn\'t a perfect anime but it has potential.Rating:Art: 9/10Characters: 8/10Soundtrack: 7/10So, grab some popcorn, sit back, and immerse yourself in this captivating world of spells and enchantments.

Even though the main casts is massive and have many important supports, it does pull off the balance very well, and every character feel natural, have their own life, and contribute to the story. It might be a bit of a headache to follow and remember all the character, but you will eventually get it and enjoy it.The main male protagonist does carry this show a bit too, this mc has one of the best mc story and energy of all time for me.J.c.staff really put their effort into this one, the production quality is above average for the fantasy genre, and is good enough for the story.In conclusion, it's the perfect blend of seriousness and chill, the story is amazing, the character is spotless, and the quality is good.

In that case, I can’t say that Reign of the Seven Spellblades will fully check off all those criteria. Still, it absolutely does a better job of creating a...more intricate, whimsical yet dangerous magical world inhabited by a likeable group of friends who aren't just three Brits being assholes towards each other, and I say that as a Brit.Reign of the Seven Spellblades is set at Kimberly Magic Academy. A castle that's much bigger on the inside where the heirs to prestigious wizard families and the gifted children of non-magical families come to learn about magic and the magical world. To graduate from this Academy means to go on to have a prosperous career and in some cases change the world whilst those who don’t are usually the victims of the arcane forces that haunt the academy halls and the dungeon dimension below.The show follows a group of six friends brought together seemingly by coincidence. We have Guy, the son of magical farmers, Pete, the child of nonmagical parents and a Reversi, a rare human who can switch between genders, Katie is an exchange student, a magical country bumpkin and an activist for the rights of demi-humans and magical creatures, Michela, the eldest daughter of the prestigious McFarlane family, Nanao, a magical samurai from the east who is very used to combat, and finally Oliver, a magical prodigy on a secret quest to avenge the death of his mother by the hands of the Kimberly staff.I can’t quite believe I’m saying this, but this is probably the first anime which introduces a core cast of six characters which doesn’t suffer from what I like to call ‘too many characters syndrome’. Not only are their introductions fairly balanced, but they all get relativity substantial character development over the season (except Guy). They’re all incredibly likeable too. They go out of their way to look out for and help one another which makes them feel like a tightly-knit group. It’s rare to find a believably written group of friends in light novel anime who also have good heads on their shoulders, but I found myself enjoying their camaraderie.The world-building is another strength the anime shows off. We’re introduced to a ton of magical creatures, plants and phenomena, spells which require proper magical sounding incantations instead of lazy “flame”, “fireball”, “wind cutter”, y’know, light novel isekai magic, and a ton of different characters and concepts that makes the world feel lived in. Of course, you have your classic wizard nobles being dickheads to students of non-magic folk, but there are debates over the rights of magical beasts, the ethics of magical research and little things like school clubs for people like Reversi and my personal favourite, a gourmet club that explores the dungeon to find, Barbecue and eat different magical beasts. I love the amount of detail the show goes into.The animation is also solid… for the first half of the season. The McDonalds of anime studios J.C.Staff had done an incredible job with some excellent magic action and little animation touches that make the show really pop, but it doesn’t last and by the end, it feels like the animation budget just ran out.There are some things about the show that bugged me, unfortunately. Because of the story's emphasis on how dangerous not only the magical world is, but also the students around our core six there's an air of suspense that never goes away. This wouldn’t be a problem if the show had some points where the characters feel safe, but those moments are few and far between and it results in Spellswords being exhausting to watch.Although it is a bit cringe to watch every girl develop some form of romantic feelings for Oliver his magical skills feel balanced until he whips out a special ability which is so broken it defuses the tension from every other fight he's in. I won’t spoil what it is, but let's just say he might as well be end-game Yhwach from Bleach.I also think the season finale was disappointing. It felt flat and unsatisfying considering the build-up the main antagonist received throughout the season. Oh yeah, and some of the students look like adults pretending to be teenagers and that always bugs me.Reign of the Seven Spellblades has quite a few flaws, but I think they're offset by its strengths.

Death is an ever present concern and the teachers aren’t going to watch over and protect you. Choosing your friends wisely is essential. Perhaps the coolest part of Nanatsuma is just how scary Kimberly is in contrast to Hogwarts from which it takes inspiration. It’s really a magical battle royale to see who’s strong enough to survive in...the magical world where even the teachers don’t have your best interest. While the anime doesn’t go into quite as much detail as the books, it does establish the treacherous nature of the school and it’s palpable in each episode.As a huge fan of the light novels, I’ve always envisioned the immense world-building and amazing characters in this story being brought to life and I’m very pleased with the job JC staff did on this one.While not without its flaws, it captures the magical essence of the story. The pacing is very well done, allowing the audience to appreciate the depth and intricacy of the world. Yes, that means at times the story feels slow, but I’d much prefer that than to have the generic fantasy story where the MC is weak one episode and then the strongest in the next episode. I’d urge patience when watching this and to actually pay attention. Yes, there’s not a fight every 5 minutes, but that doesn’t mean “nothing happens”.Speaking of the MC, one of the biggest criticisms with the modern fantasy genre is one dimensional overpowered main characters. What sets this one apart is that Nanatsuma’s MC is far from the strongest in his universe. As a result, he’s forced to rely on the other characters in the story. Every single one of Oliver’s friends play a pivotal role and the story wouldn’t be the same without them. The story is obviously heavily influenced by Harry Potter, so imagine those films without Ron, Hermoine or one of Harry’s other companions.The magic system in this series is also one of the best you’ll see in anime. There is a ton of complexity to the spells, magical creatures and techniques.While the revenge quest, characters and world-building are my favourite parts of Nanatsuma, at times it does play out like a battle shonen. There’s a lot of action in this one. JC staff did a great job with the battle choreography. They employ a rotational camera movement that adds a level of depth to the fights and makes them feel so intense.  The animation is straight up gorgeous for the big fight scenes and it honestly surpassed what I had in mind.The only real complaint I have with the anime is how the final volume of this season, volume 3 was handled. I feel that too much time was dedicated to volume 2 and some slower episodes that could have been condensed for the emotional climax that should have been episodes 14 and 15. It is what it is though, in these types of adaptations of slower paced stories you’ll always lose out on something.If you appreciate good world building, plot twists, dark fantasy and well written characters, Nanatsuma is a must watch for you.

Like usual a recap episode gets negative rating, because we have seen this a few month ago and nobody needs it. However, in a few years, we might come back here and are happy to see the Big Mom vs Kid x Law fight again!Art 9/10: It looks amazing. The coloring is great, the animation is great and, while its not flawless, it looks really good overall. I dont remember that it looked that good in the original version. And I dont really want to check so lets just assume they reworked some parts.Sound 9/10: Mama... Mama... Well,...voice acting is on point. The music is rather unsual for One Piece and surprised me a little as there is a lot of heavy metal in the background. Not really what I like, but it fit the fight very well.Story ?/10: What can I say? If you watch this recap you probably already know whats going on. Actually, the episode doesnt have any story at all. It just a fight scene and if you are here for the first time you'll únderstand nothing. But its a recap episode. So who cares, right? Unfortunately, its not the entire fight and the ending isnt included. I guess there will be another recap soon.Sooo, should you watch it? It looks great and its great entertainment so you wouldnt waste your time. Buuut, I guess it will be more interesting if you rewatch it in a few years. For the good old days.

Sasami: Mahou Shoujo Club,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1881/Sasami__Mahou_Shoujo_Club,"['(Note: This review is for both season one and two of Sasami Magical Girls Club.)Shall I take you into the mystical world of “Sasami: Mahou Shoujo Club”? A world in which both humans and witches have lived in peace and harmony, until that fateful day when humans had betrayed them and cast them away for their abnormal powers. The witches had no choice, but to build a new world, separate from the human world, where they lived in that world to reclaim the peace and harmony that was once theirs. But some witches have stayed in the human world for several purposes: family, friends, and...more. However, in order to stay in their world they had no other choice, but to never use their powers again. As a result, their powers grew weaker and weaker where it seemed as if they never had them to begin with. Soon hundreds and hundreds of years have passed and than for some strange reason, a few children all over the human world have discovered these powers. However, it is unknown if these powers are for good or evil, should these powers be ridden of for all eternity in which the same event shall not be repeated in years to come, or is this a chance for humans to finally come and accept these creatures again? There’s only one way to find out!Plot:“Sasami Magical Girls Club” is an anime about five girls, but they’re not your normal girls, each of these girls has wondrous powers which are special and unique in their own way. Usually in a magical girl anime you’d expect them to go battle some evil bad guys, however these girl s don’t have to do such a task. They usually just go on some weird adventures and such, and the whole season are mainly these girls slowly learning about the witch world and magic lots and lots of magic. So if I were to put it in a nutshell, I sometimes feel that the whole season are just plain fillers, I mean some of these episodes are just pointless, I feel like they’re not even needed in the anime in any way, only to teach us those cliché anime lessons about how much friendship is extremely important. During the last few episodes of the anime, the series grew some big boy underpants because it finally started rising up to the climax.Season 2 is a continuation of season 1, only a tad bit more serious and interesting.  It does start off a bit more slow, but later on in the series; I promise you it gets much more interesting because these girls finally have their first evil villain which I was very excited about because I like to believe that in an anime such as this one, it needs an antagonist to add as an obstacle for the magical girl group. The rest of Season 2 is pretty much cliché in a way to put it because I’ve seen this sort of development often in a magical girl anime. Its ending was somewhat to be expected though I could clearly tell that these producers could have given us a better ending.Art:The art style is nothing to die for which is a definite fact. It uses the kodomo art style which is a heavily popular style of manga, and possibly the most popular character type of anime. The kodomo art style, I must say is a perfect fit for this anime because it enraptures the cuteness needed to fully display the overall effect and maybe even potential the series has. The anime uses a large amount of colors which I really like about the whole art style because it uses the unrealistic hair colors I haven’t seen in a while, you know like weird and out of this world hair styles that can only exist in anime and manga. The art style does a great job of expressing the mood of the whole anime which are just a bunch of mixed feelings for me that is nothing special. One of my favorite things about the way the characters were drawn was their eyes, they were really adorable, and I just couldn’t stop looking at them.Sound:“Make a wish and ride with, me into the moonlight.” The opening of this anime was how do I describe it? Oh yes magical, so magical that if you just close your eyes while listening to the music, you will imagine that you are flying on shooting stars. Yep, I love the opening of this anime so much that its one of the top 20 openings in my opinion. The anime, I believe uses uncommon background music we rarely hear in anime because it uses those old effects we see in cartoons like “popping” and that sort of thing. The anime still needed appealing background music though to better add the mood of the events occurring throughout the show. I believe if the anime had some special sound effects or more official sound tracks than I bet I would have rated the anime a little higher maybe up to an 8.Characters:In an anime of the “Magical Girl” genre, I usually tend to love all main characters. However, season one of this anime took a different approach to teamwork which I can tell you is not a compliment in anyway, actually I believe it to be one of the many downfalls of this anime is its characters which leaves me and probably some of its other viewers a feeling of slight disgust in some of these main characters. The problem I have with this anime is that two of the five main characters, leave me with the impression that their bullies when their supposed to be one of the good people. When I watch this anime, I see these two girls each and every episode insult the main heroine calling her ‘stupid’ and some other insults which I find so revolting, even if it was meant to be a joke, they take it too far by insulting her each and every episode, even counting her as being the ‘fifth wheel’ of the whole entire Magical Girl group! Even though the creators try their very best to showing the viewers that these two girls are not that bad, and that they actually care about the whole Magical Girl group, it does little to no help in changing my opinion to the characters. Another problem I saw while watching this anime was that the creators didn’t do a good job of showing the girls grow closer, or get to know each other better. I didn’t see much interaction between all the five girls when it came to getting to know each other; it was like they were already best friends when they’ve only known each other for a day.  By the time the “Sasami Magical Girls Club” reached its second season was when I can finally understand that these girls really have grown to love each other a lot. Unlike season one, the anime finally dug up a hole and found gold because now the viewers can finally see the characters get to know each other more and more.Enjoyment:I originally watched the anime on 2009, three years after it came out, however dropped it because I had gotten extremely bored with the first six episodes that I actually yawned a couple of times and ended up daydreaming while trying to listen to what the fudge was going on. So yes, I was bored even after rewatching the series. There were absolutely no moments where I felt like this anime was actually worth watching, but I did get confused, very confused. “Wait, what the, why is, isn’t that, but I thought she was the mai- OH WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON!” Pretty much that was what I was saying for some parts of the anime. There were also some times when I got jealous for some romance parts, yes there is some romance in this anime, I guess you could call it that. All I know is that the romance was so cute and adorable that I imagined my crushie doing that with me… OTL If only he would do that, but sadly, not all boys are as so sweet as to act as gentlemen. more.

IT WAS AWFUL! THE ENGLISH VOICE ACTING WASAWFUL! Sasami was one of the worst protagonists ever. The reason I watched this show is because I love Magical girls, but this was horrible. The theme song was cute. The art style was cute. Those were really the only pro's. I've seen the second season too, but we arnt gonna talk about Amitav. Amitave was...anyways the story wasn't that creative. I felt like I have already seen it, it was kinda basic. I have seen the 90s Pretty Sammy...OVAs and plan to watch Magical Project S. These have the same characters and they ruined Misao and Sasami. Th ey were totally different more annoying, her brother wasnt even in it when its a spin off of his own series. The 90s sasami felt more like Cardcaptor Sakura and Magical girls club felt like some American cartoon crap. The mascot was cute and I liked the teacher. The ganator was stupid but kinda funny.Over all I would recommend this show if your really a hardcore magical girl fan but if you are not it's not worth your time.

Palme no Ki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1141/Palme_no_Ki,"['This is one of the most underrated anime movies in all history.One of unique kind. If you are expecting some nice story with happy ending just stop reading this.It\'s one genre that stands out of all of the rest, it\'s Dystopian Sci-Fi anime. If you\'ve watched Now and Then, Here and There or Gin\'iro no Kami no Agito or Green Legend Ran or even Ergo Proxy and liked them, then you will definitely like this one, it\'s just plain brilliant, unique and unforgattable. I won\'t start explaining the story that mostly is so unique that you can\'t fully understand it without throughout thinking about it....It touches many aspects of human psychology like despair, fear, wanting to be acknowledged by people you love. It\'s brilliant story of puppet wanting become human. It\'s one of the greatest works of Takashi Nakamura, the genius who created Fantastic Children, one of the most greatest anime ever created. This movie is his another brilliant work that most people haven\'t seen or even heard of. The ending is so touching that you won\'t forget it for the rest of your life, and the ending music ""Sora no Aosa"" by Akino Arai just finishes the most brilliant artistic touch. Just watch it you won\'t regret it! It touches many aspects of human psychology like despair, fear, wanting to be acknowledged by people you love.

Just watch it you won\'t regret it!', 'I didn&rsquo;t know about Tree of Palme until it was licensed by ADV.  Many of the advertisements gave me the impression that Tree of Palme would be a serious and mature title, despite the childish looking character designs.  After watching I was right for the most part, its just I could barely keep awake when watching.The first thing I noticed and probably most people, was the animation.  It is undeniable beautiful and very smooth.  Backgrounds in particular were well done and quite nice to look at.  I guess since this is a movie the animation is expected to be amazing....The character designs are reminiscent of Fantastic Children, being fairly simple and childlike.  Personally I&rsquo;m not really a fan of this kind of design but I guess it works.  Sadly, the animation and art was the only thing going for this movie.Tree of Palme has a Pinocchio like story, where a doll goes on an adventure and tires to be more human.  However, the story was told in such a confusing manner I needed to talk to my friends to figure out what was going on.  Admittedly, when I watched this I was a bit tired however, I doubt it would had made a difference.  This was due to the extremely drawn out manner in which they told the story and the fact that the director seemed so obsessed with making the movie pretty.  Perhaps the reason I was confused was because I didn&rsquo;t like/care about the characters.In general the characters were quite boring and I couldn&rsquo;t seem to care about Palme.  Even worst the characters were extremely inconsistent, acting completely different a split second later.  The motivation behind these changes in character was weak...wait was there any motivations behind these changes?  I can&rsquo;t seem to remember anymore.Perhaps that last line sums up the movie for me.  In the end The Tree of Palme was a completely forgettable movie.  The story was told in an extremely confusing manner and even worst it was boring.  Characters were bland, superficial and inconsistent and the only reason I remember the main characters name is because its in the title of the movie.  I would like to talk more as this is easily one of the shortest reviews I&rsquo;ve written but I can&rsquo;t seem to remember anything else.  Also, the only reason why I didn&rsquo;t give Tree of Palme a 1/10 was due to the high quality animation.

', 'This has got to be one of the most trippy, esoteric, surreal and all around bizarre things I have ever witnessed. You know how creepy and weird all the freaky dreams of giant oozing teddy bears that sing and destroy hospitals Tetsuo had in Akira? Imagine two hours of THAT being used to tell a Pinocchio ""I want to become a real boy!"" story, except the story is very confusing and Pinocchio is highly manic.Watching the movie, you can see the underpinnings of what in concept would be a decent story, but Takashi Nakamura mangles it so much with bland characters, muddled storytelling, heaps of...unexplained occurences, and dragged-out scenes that result is 2 hours of vegetative confusion as the viewer watches, their brain struggling to comprehend what\'s going on by gaining what little cognitive traction it can from the small kernals of coherrant storytelling underneath all the failure.The mood in the movie changes a few times as well, and is a little jarring.  It starts out with a little action in the beginning, but quickly slows down to a slow, plodding pace.  After a certain event, things pep up and it almost feels like Disney movie.  Then after another event, the movie begins a long, hour and a half descent into the aforementioned confusion, muddled story, and throws in plenty of strange, bizarre and sometimes disturbing imagery that heralds the collapse of a good concept into a rotting pile of failure.  Its as if different parts of the story were written at different times when Namakura was in different moods then mashed together in some kind of horrid amalgamation that everyone was too polite to point out was rubbish.The only redeeming qualities this movie has is that the animation is very fluid and well done (even if the character designs look a little uninspired and dated) and the sound is good.  Other than that, there is plenty to write home about,  none of which is complimentary.Avoid this like the plague.  Don\'t even accept it if someone is giving it to you for free.  If someone gives it to you as a gift, smile as you accept it and then throw it away when they leave.

The story is basically that of Pinoccio, but quickly dispel the Disney images from your mind.  This is the story of an emotionally disturbed puppet with a sever lack of empathy who is posessed by an equally emotionally disturbed amazoness who wants to become a real boy.  And while that might sound interesting, trust me, it isn't.  The ending impression is a feeling of 'what did I just witness' and 'I'm glad I didn't actually pay money to see that/I hope I can get...a refund.'The imagery is stunning, and gorgeous, such as Palm and Popo in a canoo on a river filled with glowing lotus.  The setting was reallly beautiful.  However, that juxtaposed with a dying woman being attacked by what honestly look like giant phalac symbols is just plain strange and jarring, like watching a Dali Painting in motion.  Characters are also designed to look childish, which seems at odds with the dark story.The characters, overall, are an uninteresting bunch.  Two of the main group seem to be there to look cute but serve no real purpose to the plot or development of other characters.  Popo, the main heroine simply seems to be the world's whipping girl with no backbone.  Palme is manic and seemingl has some kind of bipolar disorder coupled with a serious empathy problem, even going so far as killing something because he feels like it and is curious and practically kidnaps and hurts Popo, who he claims to love.  Shaka, who becomes Palme's sidekick and son of one of the antagonists seems to be the most able bodied, mentally stable and interesting character but takes the back seat to our bipolar puppet friend.The story itself is straightforward.  The puppet wants to be a real boy and has to go on a journey to do so.  However, the plot advances very slowly leaving the audience to watch Palme's psychotic episodes, watch Popo be abused, and be subjected to trippy imagery.  With such a straightforward plot, one might have thought either the story could have been wrapped up sooner, or a little more effort could have been placed on characters.  It also becomes more complicated than it really needs to be.  Just when you think you have a grasp on Palme's psyche, or where the story is headed, it suddenly takes an unexplained, unnecessary manic change.  What really should have been a fairly simple story was taken too far, filled with unnecessary or two dimensional characters and filled with more disturbed disorders and surrealist imagery than you can shake a stick at.  It's completely disorienting.This is certainly not a children's movie!  If my descriptions of weird creatures shaped like male anatomy and psychotic puppets and violence were not enough to explain this, I'm not sure what will.Sound and imagery are beautiful though.  If anyone is interested in surealism or revisionist fairy tales, I would reccomend this, however for the general viewer it is simply trippy, boring and confusing to watch.  It is overall a disorienting experience and a waste of two otherwise productive hours. a refund.'The imagery is stunning, and gorgeous, such as Palm and Popo in a canoo on a river filled with glowing lotus.

The characters are adorable (except for Palme, he sucks, but I can't tell you why without a major spoiler).  The virtues of this show were not enough to offset it's one flaw though.  They sacrificed the story upon the altar of symbolism. "", 'A Tree of Palme is a complicated anime that should really be viewed as ""Part One"" and ""Part Two"". With that in mind, I will be reviewing the movie not as a whole, but as two separate parts.""Part One"" of the film starts off slow, and really spends time on the atmosphere. The film feels like a trippy 70\'s poster, with creative backgrounds and creatures. Palme starts off the story as a silent puppet, constantly breaking. He\'s thrown into a confusing setting, with lots of energetic characters and action. I found it enjoyable how out-of-place hes character is and his inability to understand others.There\'s...some action, and a lot of running away from some guys who are after Palme\'s oil, which all seems simple and enjoyable. Unfortunately, that all goes away after Palme has a existential crisis.""Part Two"" of the film is very different. It\'s fast, has inconsistent characters and a really overly complicated plot is slapped on. Palme get more character development and unfortunately it\'s terrible. It\'s lazy, half developed and he changes at the blink of an eye to keep the plot moving. The film hits a really slow pace about 3/4 into the film, which made me even question finishing the film.The first part of this film is quite enjoyable to watch. It gave me a similar feeling to ""Angel\'s Egg"" but the film finished feeling like a poor scifi action film. I would recommend watching it only for the beautiful background and designs. some action, and a lot of running away from some guys who are after Palme\'s oil, which all seems simple and enjoyable.

Which I only know as the studio behind Genshiken. The film was written and directed by Nakamura Takashi. Who also did animation work on Nausicaa. How does this film hold up? Let's take a look and see.Story:We open with a woman battling through a group of dudes. We then quickly cut to a large tree where a humanoid robot, Palme, is hanging. He activates and begins moving. A little dragon sees this and fetches an elderly man, Palme's creator. The old man worries about what...kind of tree Palme might become, since he's apparently constructed in such a way that he'll become a tree at some point. A tree shaped by its memories. It turns out that he was built to look after the woman who used to live in that area but he stopped moving after she died. Things shift when the woman from the opening scene shows up. Palme mistakes her for his former mistress and agrees to look after the mechanical looking egg she's carrying. Thus begins Palme's journey.The biggest story issue is that the character conflicts can be pretty contrived. There's a point where Palme and his young friend Popo are yelling about how the other one seems different but we've only seen them interact for, maybe, ten minutes and the whole impetus behind their fight is kind of weak. So, it comes across as a fight based on them barely knowing each other rather than on anything substantial. Palme also freaks out at a different friend because he asks to see the egg Palme's carrying even though Palme hasn't shown that much protectiveness towards it before and he has no special reason to be paranoid. It's not like Frodo lashing out at Samwise when there's a clear story reason behind it it's just Palme randomly deciding he can't trust this guy based on... the dude saving his life multiple times. And you know you've gotta be wary of that type.That aspect aside, there are a lot of elements to admire in the story. I like that it builds suspense on the basis of this tree transformation. A lot of the tension does come from this ominous idea of just what kind of tree he might become and we see him do quite a few things that make that a cause for concern. Honestly, it also makes for kind of a refreshing change since his personal journey is, ultimately, of greater import than the physical journey. The film is also really good at taking a lot of seemingly disparate elements and tying them together by the end and at providing foreshadowing for how they're going to do it. Which makes for a tale that's very well woven. The pacing is well done. The climax is compelling and well executed.Characters:The main cast is pretty nicely done. One issue is that the film might go a bit too far in setting up the possibility of  Palme going badly. To the point where it's pretty hard to have sympathy for him after a while. Instead, you find yourself concerned for Popo, Shatta and the other major characters and what Palme going bad would do to them. I do like that none of the antagonistic characters are portrayed as being all bad. The one that comes the closest is Popo's mum, but even with her her faults are very human and she's not entirely unsympathetic.Art:The biggest flaw with the art is that the facial expressions can be off at times. Characters will go cross-eyed or they'll be having an intense moment and have an expression of slight annoyance. However, the world design is really well done. With amazing backgrounds, creature designs and various technologies. The action moves very well and the designs are interesting. So, in general it is a nice looking film. It just has the occasional awkward moment.Sound:There are some really good actors cast in this. The best performances come, no question, from Toyoguchi Megumi & Sakaguchi Daisuke. There are no weak links in the cast, though. They all do nice work. The music is also well done. It works well for the atmosphere and action.Ho-yay:There isn't any to be found.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, Palme no Ki is a really good film. It has some issues that hold it back, but it has a good level of complexity, interesting characters, a strong narrative, a great cast and lovely artwork. My final rating is going to stand at a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Idol Project. kind of tree Palme might become, since he's apparently constructed in such a way that he'll become a tree at some point. A tree shaped by its memories.

At first glance it may seem like a movie for children, and some elements of it almost feel like one, but it definitely isn't. It's very bleak, at times melancholic and at others very violent, both phisically and psychologically, it's dense and can be hard to follow, and has very mature themes.It's an anime that everybody will experience differently, because while some of it has the potentiel to resonate with you very deeply, some other elements are just not very good.One...one hand, the plot can be confusing at times, there are too much elements in the movie and not enough time to develop all of them as much as they need to. A few characters (Mu and Pu) are unnecessary and would have greatly improved the movie by not being in it, leaving room for other more important things and making the tone a bit more consistent. Overall, the writing feels a bit inexperienced and rushed in places, like something that they should have taken time to refine more.On the other hand, the anime is gorgeous in every way possible. The backgrounds, the animation, the artstyle, the world depicted, and the music too... there really isn't anything quite like it. The world of A Tree of Palme is incredibly unique, rich, creative, and constantly feels much bigger than what is shown. Every location, almost every scene is filled with things that feel both truly alien and breathtakingly beautiful. The music supports extremely well that otherworldly quality, with it's mix of strange synthetic sounds and orchestal music. The animation is on point, extremely smooth, precise and expressive.I think watching the characters wander through that world is what I enjoyed the most about this movie. If this visual style speaks to you, then that in itself is a good reason to watch it.The story, while it might be flawed, has some great elements. While it does try to be about too many things at once, and in my opinion fails to develop every aspect of it's themes, a lot of it is still very good. The characters all tie into the different themes in interesting ways, and their psychologies and relationships are very developped in a mature and complex way, which to me has the potential to resonate very deeply with you if you identify with one or several of the characters.I general, I would say that A Tree of Palme is a movie that is more than just it's flaws and qualities. It's a complex work that feels very genuine and passionate, it's clear that Nakamura wanted to express a lot of things with it and he did so in a way that is, while at times clumsy and inexperienced, very beautiful.I think it's a movie that more people should see, because of how unique and special it is, and because of how touching it can be. one hand, the plot can be confusing at times, there are too much elements in the movie and not enough time to develop all of them as much as they need to.

He now starts to talk more and have a specific desire (to be a human), so the first initial problem (Taking the Egg of Touto to Laala) becomes less important, and you need to care about his new personality and desire. The same applies to the Sol Lady, and although I personally liked...and even cried for her past, it did feel kinda of rushed.Everything was there to make a good story, and the writes did know that and tried to show as much as they could, but doing this they created a movie with a deep lore, but poorly placed.Even saying all this, I still liked it, the audacity of the writers in putting some scenes in the film impressed me, some characters really stood out during the plot.

It literally deserves so much more love especially if you're into music and comedy. This series has great songs that are worth listening to over and over again haha. I don't really have any cons to say abt this anime but for the story, I think it could use more drama but I mean, it's already pretty good so I'm not mad. The characters...are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up.

Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I don't really have any cons to say abt this anime but for the story, I think it could use more drama but I mean, it's already pretty good so I'm not mad.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better. I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself.

The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu. know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode.

They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up.

Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good. If you are someone interested in the genre, you'll definitely like this."", ""FOR A 12 EPISODES ANIME, STUDIO SHOULD'VE STOP FOCUSING ON TOO MANY CHARACTERS. THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching. It literally deserves so much more love especially if you're into music and comedy. This series has great songs that are worth listening to over and over again haha. I don't really have any cons to say abt this anime but for the story, I think it could use more drama but I mean, it's already pretty good so I'm not mad. The characters...are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music. Please please don't throw hate on me because I know that there are a lot of anime series with the same genres, but this is my opinion, and I respect yours. In summary, this anime is really worth checking out if you're into this type of stuff.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu. know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu.', 'Here we go again: Japan loves its idol business quite a lot, and no matter, because it\'s quite the popularity over there. Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either.

It literally deserves so much more love especially if you're into music and comedy. This series has great songs that are worth listening to over and over again haha. I don't really have any cons to say abt this anime but for the story, I think it could use more drama but I mean, it's already pretty good so I'm not mad. The characters...are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music. Please please don't throw hate on me because I know that there are a lot of anime series with the same genres, but this is my opinion, and I respect yours. In summary, this anime is really worth checking out if you're into this type of stuff.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser.

Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice. The artwork can be pretty at the best moments. Animation can feel stiff at times, but it\'s fine overall. In fact, it gotten good in the finale.Overall, ICHU was mediocre but inoffensive.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu. know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother.""

Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu.', 'Here we go again: Japan loves its idol business quite a lot, and no matter, because it\'s quite the popularity over there. Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode.

They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

The characters...are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music. Please please don't throw hate on me because I know that there are a lot of anime series with the same genres, but this is my opinion, and I respect yours. In summary, this anime is really worth checking out if you're into this type of stuff. It's really good and I can't wait for the next episodes to come! are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music.

It's really good and I can't wait for the next episodes to come!"", 'I find it mildly amusing that the anime idol industry is just as saturated as the actual idol industry. I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it. Otherwise, there\'s better stuff out there. of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu.', 'Here we go again: Japan loves its idol business quite a lot, and no matter, because it\'s quite the popularity over there. Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle.

Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I don't really have any cons to say abt this anime but for the story, I think it could use more drama but I mean, it's already pretty good so I'm not mad.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better. I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself.

The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu. know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode.

They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up.

Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good. If you are someone interested in the genre, you'll definitely like this."", ""FOR A 12 EPISODES ANIME, STUDIO SHOULD'VE STOP FOCUSING ON TOO MANY CHARACTERS. THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching. It literally deserves so much more love especially if you're into music and comedy. This series has great songs that are worth listening to over and over again haha. I don't really have any cons to say abt this anime but for the story, I think it could use more drama but I mean, it's already pretty good so I'm not mad. The characters...are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music. Please please don't throw hate on me because I know that there are a lot of anime series with the same genres, but this is my opinion, and I respect yours. In summary, this anime is really worth checking out if you're into this type of stuff.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu. know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu.', 'Here we go again: Japan loves its idol business quite a lot, and no matter, because it\'s quite the popularity over there. Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either.

It literally deserves so much more love especially if you're into music and comedy. This series has great songs that are worth listening to over and over again haha. I don't really have any cons to say abt this anime but for the story, I think it could use more drama but I mean, it's already pretty good so I'm not mad. The characters...are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music. Please please don't throw hate on me because I know that there are a lot of anime series with the same genres, but this is my opinion, and I respect yours. In summary, this anime is really worth checking out if you're into this type of stuff.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser.

Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice. The artwork can be pretty at the best moments. Animation can feel stiff at times, but it\'s fine overall. In fact, it gotten good in the finale.Overall, ICHU was mediocre but inoffensive.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu. know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother.""

Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu.', 'Here we go again: Japan loves its idol business quite a lot, and no matter, because it\'s quite the popularity over there. Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode.

They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

The characters...are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music. Please please don't throw hate on me because I know that there are a lot of anime series with the same genres, but this is my opinion, and I respect yours. In summary, this anime is really worth checking out if you're into this type of stuff. It's really good and I can't wait for the next episodes to come! are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music.

It's really good and I can't wait for the next episodes to come!"", 'I find it mildly amusing that the anime idol industry is just as saturated as the actual idol industry. I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it. Otherwise, there\'s better stuff out there. of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu.', 'Here we go again: Japan loves its idol business quite a lot, and no matter, because it\'s quite the popularity over there. Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle.

Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I don't really have any cons to say abt this anime but for the story, I think it could use more drama but I mean, it's already pretty good so I'm not mad.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better. I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself.

The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu. know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode.

They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up.

Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good. If you are someone interested in the genre, you'll definitely like this."", ""FOR A 12 EPISODES ANIME, STUDIO SHOULD'VE STOP FOCUSING ON TOO MANY CHARACTERS. THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching. It literally deserves so much more love especially if you're into music and comedy. This series has great songs that are worth listening to over and over again haha. I don't really have any cons to say abt this anime but for the story, I think it could use more drama but I mean, it's already pretty good so I'm not mad. The characters...are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music. Please please don't throw hate on me because I know that there are a lot of anime series with the same genres, but this is my opinion, and I respect yours. In summary, this anime is really worth checking out if you're into this type of stuff.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu. know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu.', 'Here we go again: Japan loves its idol business quite a lot, and no matter, because it\'s quite the popularity over there. Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either.

It literally deserves so much more love especially if you're into music and comedy. This series has great songs that are worth listening to over and over again haha. I don't really have any cons to say abt this anime but for the story, I think it could use more drama but I mean, it's already pretty good so I'm not mad. The characters...are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music. Please please don't throw hate on me because I know that there are a lot of anime series with the same genres, but this is my opinion, and I respect yours. In summary, this anime is really worth checking out if you're into this type of stuff.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser.

Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice. The artwork can be pretty at the best moments. Animation can feel stiff at times, but it\'s fine overall. In fact, it gotten good in the finale.Overall, ICHU was mediocre but inoffensive.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu. know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother.""

Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu.', 'Here we go again: Japan loves its idol business quite a lot, and no matter, because it\'s quite the popularity over there. Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode.

They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent.

The characters...are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music. Please please don't throw hate on me because I know that there are a lot of anime series with the same genres, but this is my opinion, and I respect yours. In summary, this anime is really worth checking out if you're into this type of stuff. It's really good and I can't wait for the next episodes to come! are also great, but not a 10 since they could use more tweaking with their attitudes but I'm not going to complain a lot since I rarely see this type of anime that actually incorporates comedy, slice of life, and music.

It's really good and I can't wait for the next episodes to come!"", 'I find it mildly amusing that the anime idol industry is just as saturated as the actual idol industry. I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it. Otherwise, there\'s better stuff out there. of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu.', 'Here we go again: Japan loves its idol business quite a lot, and no matter, because it\'s quite the popularity over there. Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements.

This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’.', 'Is this review going to be bias? - Probably, because I\'ve played the original game from launch till closed from 2015-2019. And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are.

I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot. Halfway Through the Idol has a generic idol-centric plot, and it\'s nothing more or nothing less than typical.Art: 8/10As a huge fan of the og and new I-chu game series, seeing the boys finally live and moving 2D is a dream come true! After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle. However there are times where the colours and panels really make the characters glow. It\'s actually really nice as a long-time fan to see them all come to life this way.Sound: 10/10One of the best thing about I-chu would be their music. Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it. My favourite was the Fire Fenyx track!If you\'re specifically looking for a mediocre male idol anime, you got it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

THEY SHOULD'VE JUST FOCUSED MORE ON THE MAIN 3. they shove so many characters onto my face but i still don't remember most of their names. since they decided to focus on many characters, the anime feels rushed and we can't see the main 3's character development.Some episodes are painfully boring especially the beach episode. i usually like when they make an episode where the characters are chilling and interacting more with each others but this episode disappoints me. it was so boring i almost considered dropping. i noticed that they didn't...know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it) know how to execute scenes very well. for example, during a comedy scene, they should've put comedy music. the right music and the right music placement can enhance any scenes execution. not so sad scene can become sadder, not so comedic scenes can become more lively if they use the right music and know when to put the music.Also, i don't know how minato kanata, one of the main 3 can become an idol. his speaking voice is so painful to hear. he sounds like there's something stuck in his throat. i'm not insulting the voice actor cause when he sings, he sounds good so i know his speaking voice is forced.I actually want to give this anime a 3/10 but since i was able to finish this anime so i give it a 5/10 (even though i forced myself to finish it)"", ""This is my first review in this site but that doesn't mean this anime is my all-time favorite one, I just wanted to make a review because it's super underrated and one of the anime series that I really enjoy watching.

I mean there has to be an extent to which too much is too much, right? Maybe I’m just thinking too hard about this; let’s just talk about pretty anime boys singing.Story:The I-Chu academy is a prestigious idol school that ‘s known to deliver some of the most promising boy group idols that (apparently) the world has ever seen. Here we’re introduced to the newest groups of I-chu, one of which being Fire Fenyx, a group of three hopefuls who hope to stake their claim in...the idol world. But what stands in their way is not only about 20 or so rivals that all form about 6-7 different groups, but also the principal who stuffed himself in a giant teddy bear suit for the lols and tortures all of them with potential expulsion if they don’t meet the requirements. So just like how real idols work; glad this show’s got some real world parallels here.Given this show’s origin as a mobile rhythm game, I wasn’t surprised at all with how the story of this show ended up. The story has pretty much only two different kinds of plot threads. Either we have a small overarching thread where all of the characters have to collectively pass over the hurdle, or we have individual episodes which focus on a small handful of the characters in an episodic romp that basically has no lasting consequence over the rest of the series. I’m sure this anime was made specifically just to advertise the franchise and sell the cute anime boys to the audience, but even on that front, I feel like they did the absolute bare minimum in order to try and convince the audience to try and delve further into the series. This is mostly because as a result of the story direction chosen, the show feels painfully generic and fabricated to the point that some episodes feel like there really wasn’t a point for them to exist in the first place. Often times while watching I just kind of zoned out because there really wasn’t anything on the screen that interested me, and the bloat of the cast really didn’t do the series any favors as a result. Of course this is nothing new to I-chu, as many mobile game adaptations have suffered similar problems, but I’d argue that it’s worse here since there came a point where I feel like the fabricated stakes meant nothing, and character moments just kinda got glossed over like they were just functioning off of a script.And at the end of the day, there really isn’t much I can actually say about the story. The story is really just the framework that’s meant to give the characters the anime’s trying to sell you on a platform to stand on. Kind of like a fancy display box that moves. Now, could they have really put in the effort to deliver a good enough story to make this idol game better? Yes, but of course it’s not the story the show is trying to sell us on now is it?Characters:The boys and all of their quirks both in their group and as individuals are pretty much the reason to watch the show/play their game. And I cannot remember many if any of their names. Cast bloat is a major problem I have with mobile game adaptations because they attempt to shove in as many characters as they possible can in order to showcase the wide array of different tropes that they have. I-chu offers a wide array of characters from spunky boys, to moody boys, child-like boys, cool distant boys, and basically traps. But because they’re all so one-note, all of them are hardly characters in their own right, with even fewer of them getting dedicated episodes in order to try an expand them. Which mostly just end up being reassurances that their only character trait is ok or some kind of other artificial reconciliation for something I didn’t think was even a problem, but hey, gotta fill up the time somehow. This problem extends further as more and more characters end up being put into the fold, thus homogenizing the cast into a variety of different faces that all end up serving the same role because barely anyone has any form of individuality that’s worth noting.The other two characters worth any kind of mention are the Producer and the Principal, characters who’re really only there to help explain the plot to the audience and create the bastardized situations that the boys have to deal with. Sure the principal is eccentric given his speech pattern and willingness to torture the boys for the sake of ‘helping’ them, somehow, but I’d argue that’s not really much of a character, but rather the series’ conflict given form.Aesthetics:Lay-duce’s art for this series is probably one of the better aspects of the show if only for how colorful everything is and how nice the boys look. On a design level, all of the boys have a distinct look from one another which sure, while I don’t remember their names, at least gives everyone a distinct look reminiscent of the trope that each of them represents. Something that becomes more prominent when you look into the overall group dynamic of each idol group that the 30+ boys are put into. I’d argue this is a byproduct of the cast originating from a mobile game, but at the very least Lay-duce’s art for the characters and the look of the series on the whole is nice to look at. That being said, the amount of shine in these characters’ eyes are staggering. Everyone has like 4-5 white circles inside their pupil, and it’s actually kinda scary because it makes it seem like these characters have blindingly bright futures ahead of them despite being idols.But of course since this is an idol show, the music plays a big part of the the series too. Which is what I would be saying if the show put in any effort to the music. All of the music in this show is representative of pop idol culture with the OP and ED each being sung by a myriad of seiyuus that voice this show.Likewise all of the groups each have one single that they sing throughout the show. Meaning at no point in the series will one group sing anything else except the song that the first sung when they were introduced. Which is a little disappointing for a number of reasons. One because after a while it gets really boring to hear the exact same thing over and over again when idols should in theory have an entire playlist to pick from. And two because the plot often tries to have someone from one group demonize a member of a different group for not being ‘up to snuff’. Which leads to a mini character arc for the demonized character to better themselves. Only for them to later show the person or group that demonized them how much better they got by singing the exact same song again using most likely the exact same recording. Making it seem like there’s significant change when really it doesn’t sound like it at all. Leading to further artificiality with how the show presents itself. It’s all a bit disappointing at the end of the day because while I do think the songs are honestly not that bad, the enjoyment of hearing them starts to wear thin when this becomes the ninth time I’ve unwillingly heard “Jewelry Dust”, and Fire Fenyx has only sang “Jewelry Dust” throughout the entire series.Personal Enjoyment:I wanted to try something new this season, maybe go out of my comfort zone a little bit by throwing caution to the wind and watch an idol show for no reason other than I can and I will. Was this a rewarding experience? Not really. While I was dead set on making fun of the show for one reason or another because of either the massive cast bloat, the fact that I had to take a giant stuffed bear as a school principal seriously, or the “power of friendship” trope through the power of song, over time I lost interest in even trying to have fun with the show because I-chu didn’t feel like it was trying itself.I-chu is just so painfully bland and uninteresting from all angles that episodes could probably be summed up in one or two sentences with little to no loss on what was going on. The show also doesn’t have a lot of consistency about it since we practically jump from one group to another in a form of whiplash that I just kind of got used to because I didn’t remember anyone’s names in the first place, so it didn’t really matter if we went from the spunky shonen kid to the chuunis in the span of 15 minutes. Over time the cast actually got larger with about 3-4 new groups being introduced over the course of the series which feels pretty excessive considering by the time the show tried to solidify who or what we already had, we just got more idols.All of this combined with the fact that the music side of all things felt like they put in the absolute bare minimum in order to make it seem like these guys were actually idols leads me to put this series in the bucket of ‘failed advertisement anime’, since I’m certain the only reason why this show exists was either as fanservice or as a way to potentially attract new people to play or try out the game. While I’m certain that I am nowhere near the correct demographic for this kind of show or genre, I can almost say for certain that if fans of this series wanted an anime adaptation, they should get something better than this. Cause more than anything, this show feels unmemorable. And that I think is a worse fate than just being a ‘bad show’. the idol world.

And I am still playing its new game, Etoile Stage which came out in 2020. And i have quite a collection of their song CDs at home stored nicely on my shelf and ripped into my Spotify account.Spoiler free? - YES. No spoilers in review.I-Chu: Halfway Through the Idol is an I-chu anime adaption from the game ""I-chu: Etoile Stage"", which is an idol manager game. I-chu was originally a rhythm mobile game which came out in 2015, and ceased servers mid-2019. If you...know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot.

After waiting 6 years! It is a shame that their wardrobe is nothing more than 1-2 different costumes put on a cycle.

Halfway Through the Idol *ONLY* has Ichu: Etoile Stage beats since this anime is no doubt a promotion of the new game. In all honesty, F∞F\'s ""I am a Hero"" would probably have made a bigger impact since it is their debut track from the original game. However, if you do enjoy the shorts of the music in Halfway Through the Idol, I do urge for you to look up their other songs and bask in all their firey bops.Character: 8/10Halfway Through the Idol really does show a lot of the boys in their natural habitat. It\'s honestly nice to see them actually banter with each other. However I only wish that Twinkle Bell recieve a lot more screentime throughout, rather than just being the comedic reliefs in the series. They\'re hardworking boys as well with their song ""Eien Travelors"" being one of my favourite beat from the Etoile Stage game itself. It\'s a shame that all other units had more in depth screentime but leaving the twins behind. Other than that, the anime really does great job bringing the characters to life into fine-ass 2D hahaEnjoyment: 9/10Look, to a non-idol, non-ichu gamer, and just curious to see another idol anime viewer, I-chu: Halfway Through the Idol would probably just seem mediocre and just ""oh, it\'s another idol anime anyway, time to pass."" I don\'t blame em, or the rating up on MAL to be <7.I-Chu from the beginning, was an underrated game that never really exploded outside of Japan, and that it came out during the global peak of LLSIF, and the start of Enstars, Bpro, YumeCast and i7 half a decade ago, and it is still going strong in 2021 proves that the franchise itself is not as dead and still *has* it\'s fans. The anime Halfway Through the Idol is just an extension of what I-chu already has - to open up to global viewers as well, and perhaps to draw them in into the franchise.I really enjoy the I-chu anime a lot. I feel blessed to see Mitsurugi Akira moving in 2D on on pc. I feel blessed to have seen one of my beloved idol franchise actually get that anime recognition.I enjoy I-chu because of their beats and bops.I enjoy I-chu because I\'ve been playing their games since 2015. Read their stories since 2015. And bought countless official merchandise of them all since 2015.This anime is just a bonus for me and to other I-chu fans to bask in their glory and 2D pixels. Overall, I do think it\'s a good anime and adaptation. And i want more people to actually listen to their other songs, subunits and crossunits of Liber\'s og rhythm mobage, I-chu. know of the series A3! then I-chu would be considered their ""big brother."" They are from the same gaming company Liber anyway.Story: 7/10Following the story of an aspiring I-chu singer Aido Seiya, the anime centers around the main unit F∞F (Fire Fenix) and their journey to be the No.1 I-chu idol of their generation. The original I-chu games obviously cover all units and their backstory, however as Seiya is the main face of the franchise it is obvious that him and his unit would be the focus of the plot.

Sadly, trying to invest those types of anime adaptations anywhere outside the Land of the Rising Sun is bound to be overshadowed, and I★Chu is no different.Being a Liber Entertainment game adaptation, the one series that I can immediately infer to is the A3! series with all of its seasonal troupes and what-nots. Though I★Chu came first before A3!, I\'d infer that the latter proves to be more popular (as per the Studio 3Hz x P.A. Works anime adaptation) and more grounded, and...I can see why that there\'s a clear reason to market the former as the first one rolled out under the Liber Entertainment list of IPs.Sadly, as ""best"" as idol shows like this can go, I★Chu scrapes the bottom of the barrel with its story and plot tied to the franchise with the rhythm game (that ceased in 2019) and the follow-up (which is Étoile Stage, released in 2020) that this show is based upon, with the same mediocre generic settings and such, though I\'ll give props that the marketing is on-point for hardcore fans that are loyal to the franchise. You got your usual case of newbie Bishounen idol groups trying to make a mark in the idol scene, and that\'s usually the sub-standard when it comes to idol shows and its many groups that are deemed the 3-month, 12-episode time to gloss through what makes them tick and unique, OK fine.The one constant issue I have is the music department, because idol shows will try to capitalize on getting as much from the music labels sold, but I★Chu being as it is, follows the Étoile Stage treatment of only having 1 song per idol group that honest to god, you hear it the first time, and subsequent features make you immediately want to forget about it. Like I said, the anime suffers from the on-point marketing direction, and I\'d not blame you if you\'ve dropped off from the very beginning.Other than that, I did not foresee Lay-Duce to help produce an idol show, but I\'d guess that\'s also fine for showing some good Bishounen character visuals for the fans, pretty good for the most part...maybe TOO good to make it stylish for it to stand out.To fans of I★Chu, you\'re in luck for this show replicating everything you wanted with your expectations, but for everyone else, you\'re better off watching any other idol show instead that is leaps and bounds better.

Look, its super mediocre, and it\'s really not that great. But still, I give it props for keeping me watching.The characters were so so so normal. I mean, I still didn\'t know their names and couldn\'t even tell most of them apart even at the end, except for the main 3.The only interesting group was Kokoro\'s, and THAT\'s because she was a cross-dresser. They were all either ridiculously sunshiny or over passion-driven (the I-will-sing-till-I-die-kind, you now what I mean).I guess the only thing that kept me watching was the ""competition""...of sorts that they had, but even that fazed ut by the end. Although that confrontation with Seiya and Tsubaki was legit though, and I liked the message.I started out thinking it was kinda different, but it ended up being pretty standard. the music was actually ok though, and was one of the good things about it.

It is not the worst, but it\'s definitely below average. Although it gave me a positive first impression, it steadily declined with each episode. For a story about students training to become idols, none of those students were likeable or memorable in any way. They often stick to archetypes and the way the show handles their screen time made it even harder to know them better outside of their ""idol gimmick"". The show couldn\'t even express their struggles in a way that makes me remotely care about them. The only idol group who I remember the most fondly was ReBeserk. Maybe it\'s...their MCing or eccentric personalities, but every time they talk I was entertained. Even though they\'re not the main characters and they don\'t talk as much, I felt more attached to them than the main four groups. There\'s not much to comment about the Producer and President of the ICHU school other than they are typical adult characters in an idol anime.This leads to another issue--their soundtrack which was almost nonexistent. The show tends to skim through their songs which made me struggle to see why they deserve to be idols. The songs that were able to come through weren\'t great either. The finale didn\'t even give me an impression outside of ""meh"". To me, the OST is important for an idol anime as it\'s a reflection to who these characters are. Even though they won\'t sing as much, as long as that one song was catchy and memorable that\'s fine.Production-wise, ICHU is okay. The character designs are nice.

The song was cute, catchy, and I found myself falling in love with it. I instantly googled it, and eventually found my way to the anime.I'm not an idol anime aficionado, but for what it was, I Chu was decent.Individually, the characters were bland and lackluster. However!!! Their group concepts were all mildly interesting. From a band of crossdressers to a band with members all across the globe to a group...with Chuunibyou, their concepts were all unique. The story itself isn't that great but isn't that bad either. I didn't finish the last episode thinking I wasted my time.For me, the big selling point of the show was the music, and I Chu delivered. For the first time ever, I' went out of my way to download anime songs onto my Spotify so I can listen to them anywhere. The groups all have a distinct sound which I thought was enjoyable, and the songs themselves were pretty good.Personally, the good music balanced out with the boring story to make a halfway decent show.If you are looking for a top-tier idol anime with deep character building and wonderful music, I Chu will surely disappoint you, but if you are a more casual viewer looking for some music with a bit of a show, I Chu might be something to give a try.06 ❁: Although it has some minor issues, this is still very good.

Omishi Mahou Gekijou: Risky★Safety,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1300/Omishi_Mahou_Gekijou__Risky★Safety,"['Oh wow, this was really good.  Before I start a more in depth-review, I\'ll say this: if you have any emotions in you, go watch this.  Your emotions will thank you.Now then.Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they\'re in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on...random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~ random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.

It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story. If anything, it’s subtext.Basically, Risky Safety is just yet another light-hearted comedy anime with a few more emotional or darker themes thrown into it.The music may be the best part of this anime. Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend.

Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~ random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".

It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story.

It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did.

However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~ random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.

It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story.

Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend.

Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~', 'I won’t say I don’t like Risky Safety. It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story. If anything, it’s subtext.Basically, Risky Safety is just yet another light-hearted comedy anime with a few more emotional or darker themes thrown into it.The music may be the best part of this anime. Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend. It’s just slightly above average. a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone.

Your emotions will thank you.Now then.Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they\'re in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on...random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.

It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story. If anything, it’s subtext.Basically, Risky Safety is just yet another light-hearted comedy anime with a few more emotional or darker themes thrown into it.The music may be the best part of this anime. Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend.

Your emotions will thank you.Now then.Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they\'re in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on...random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.

When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend. It’s just slightly above average.', 'Oh wow, this was really good.  Before I start a more in depth-review, I\'ll say this: if you have any emotions in you, go watch this.  Your emotions will thank you.Now then.Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they\'re in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on...random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~ random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.

What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~ random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.

It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story. If anything, it’s subtext.Basically, Risky Safety is just yet another light-hearted comedy anime with a few more emotional or darker themes thrown into it.The music may be the best part of this anime. Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend.

Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.

It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show.

It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend.

But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~', 'I won’t say I don’t like Risky Safety. It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story. If anything, it’s subtext.Basically, Risky Safety is just yet another light-hearted comedy anime with a few more emotional or darker themes thrown into it.The music may be the best part of this anime. Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend. It’s just slightly above average. a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone.

Your emotions will thank you.Now then.Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they\'re in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on...random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.

It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story. If anything, it’s subtext.Basically, Risky Safety is just yet another light-hearted comedy anime with a few more emotional or darker themes thrown into it.The music may be the best part of this anime. Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did.

Your emotions will thank you.Now then.Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they\'re in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on...random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.

Your emotions will thank you.Now then.Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they\'re in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on...random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~ random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.

It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story. If anything, it’s subtext.Basically, Risky Safety is just yet another light-hearted comedy anime with a few more emotional or darker themes thrown into it.The music may be the best part of this anime. Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky.

But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~ random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?

It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story. If anything, it’s subtext.Basically, Risky Safety is just yet another light-hearted comedy anime with a few more emotional or darker themes thrown into it.The music may be the best part of this anime. Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend.

Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~', 'I won’t say I don’t like Risky Safety. It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story.

Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend.

Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.

The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~', 'I won’t say I don’t like Risky Safety. It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story. If anything, it’s subtext.Basically, Risky Safety is just yet another light-hearted comedy anime with a few more emotional or darker themes thrown into it.The music may be the best part of this anime. Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend. It’s just slightly above average. a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone.

Your emotions will thank you.Now then.Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they\'re in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on...random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".

But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.

Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend.

Your emotions will thank you.Now then.Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they\'re in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on...random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~ random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.

Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~ random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.

Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story.

It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did.

But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~ random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.  Stuff happens and things get weird but in the end it does come back to the main point.So when I first saw this and read the synopsis, I thought ""oh it\'s like Shinigami no Ballad + Shakugan no Shana-tan"".  Actually, that\'s not too far off.  If you like the character of Shana-tan, you\'re going to LOVE Risky.  But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.

Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend.

But what really got me here was that, taken the basic plot outline, Risky / Safety did the best job they possibly could have.Well, almost.The one thing I have against Risky / Safety is that those random stories, especially the ridiculous Star Trek-esque epic and the thing with Ma-chan, somewhat detract  from the amazing romantic plot.  Honestly, this anime could have been a straight-up slice of life...that is, until you get to where stuff really gets screwed up nearer to the end.This anime, above all else, makes you think while you cry tears of happiness and stifle tears of sorrow.  Yes, a moe comedic anime that makes you think.  Under all those nonstop gags from Risky and Safety and the general lighthearted aura the art gives, there are really deep psychological and philisophical questions and ideas at work.  What does it mean to be good or evil?  Is there a gray area in between?  Is there a similar gray area between joy and despair?  Is that where humanity really should be, in a bittersweet middleground?  Very good musing material to come out of something that looks like a cute, mindless anime that can waste 24 sets of ten minutes of your life.  But it\'s not one of those...it\'s an anime that can make 24 sets of ten minutes of your life more fulfilling than watching even some serious anime.So let\'s go through these categories.Story: Some flaws, some times where I can\'t help but just go ""wtf"" and pretend I know what\'s going on.  It\'s not like it\'s perfect, but it\'s beautiful how it works out despite the flaws.Art: I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something from 1999-2000.  When I think of that era I think of Pokemon days.  But no, moe existed then too.  :3  But really, besides that, the artistic style of Risky / Safety was what it should be for this type of thing--nice enough to enjoy watching, colorful, but at the same time simple enough so that you cannot get too distracted by it.Sound: The ED song is nice :)  Usually the BGM is kind of generic slice-of-life type stuff, but episode 16 is an exception.  Episode 16 is done in a silent movie style, and in the spirit of that, they composed a very good musical score.  I\'m impressed.  One thing this could\'ve done without, though, is a narrator.  It reminded me of Binchou-tan\'s narrator.  However, she started to get really psychological after a while and I guess it helps get you thinking about the topics at hand.Character: This is what makes Risky / Safety so great.  The central cast is quite small (consisting of basically Risky, Safety, Moe and Yuya, the latter of which is Moe\'s love interest, and Lani, the dog), and that lets the characters (with the possible exception of Yuya, since this is from Moe\'s point of view somewhat) really blossom into something that you can connect to.  Even minor or non-reoccuring characters are fleshed out enough for their moments of emotional amazingness to be really effective.Enjoyment: I\'m quite an emotional person, so I loved the emotional rollercoaster that this show set up.  It\'s really got something for everybody (yes, it even has an epic monster fight.  No, I don\'t think it was needed.  But whatever, let the animators have their fun).tl;dr go watch this if you are a human with feelings.or a shinigami.or an angel....YOROSHIKU BABY~', 'I won’t say I don’t like Risky Safety. It was fine. It’s just that this anime is just kind of like any other light-hearted slice of life show. Sure, there’s stuff about love, jealousy, and depression, but it doesn’t consume the story enough to actually make it a big part of the story. If anything, it’s subtext.Basically, Risky Safety is just yet another light-hearted comedy anime with a few more emotional or darker themes thrown into it.The music may be the best part of this anime. Honestly the ending theme may just be the best part of this whole thing.Risky safety was...a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone. It’s another one of those shows where a regular person has a supernatural thing come into their life, yeah that’s pretty normal, but the thing that comes into her life is an angel and a devil. When you say nice things or feel happy the devil turns into the angel, and if you’re sad and say bad things then she turns into a devil. The angel is Safety and the devil is Risky. I like that concept. I just wish they did more with that concept than what they did. Some episodes used it better than others.Risky safety is a fine show, but I think there’s a reason nobody talks about it. It just isn’t interesting enough to talk about or recommend. It’s just slightly above average. a cool concept though, even if on paper it seems overdone.

Your emotions will thank you.Now then.Risky / Safety is basically about an apprentice shinigami named Risky and an apprentice angel named Safety who share the same body (which is 13cm tall).  Risky is present when the person they\'re in tune with emotionally is sad, and Safety is there when he or she is happy.  Moe, a slightly insecure junior high girl, is this person for most of the series even though they go off on...random tangents in the form of odd stories sometimes.
