Starship Troopers: Red Planet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36194/Starship_Troopers__Red_Planet,"[""No reviews at the time of writing, so here goes mine :)Red Planet is a surprisingly decent movie. It does not excel in any department but it does not fail in any neither.I know many people hate the computer graphics but here it kinda fits the setting. Most of the time we're shown spaceships, corridors, bugs, and soldiers in full armor; and it looks really good. It does not look that good when the focus shifts to unarmored humans, or when the soldiers remove their helmets. Normal humans move... weird (for lack of a better term) and faces look off too.The story and characters...are quite predictable, but to my surprise this installment does have some of the dark humor, sarcasm and criticism of the fascist state that the Verhoeven movie had. So it gets bonus points there.The action, like the rest of the movie, is not top notch but is way better than average. It does not go too far into gore territory but it does not shy away from some dismemberment either. The guns are solid, the bugs agile and fierce, and the mechs (yes, it has mechs) kick ass.Overall 7/10 and better than the previous (Starship Troopers: Invasion). are quite predictable, but to my surprise this installment does have some of the dark humor, sarcasm and criticism of the fascist state that the Verhoeven movie had.

Tantei Opera Milky Holmes: Alternative,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14647/Tantei_Opera_Milky_Holmes__Alternative,"['Tantei Opera Milky Holmes was a series that caught me by surprise with its eccentric characters and ridiculous humor. This special, however, is Milky Holmes devoid of the charm that made the original series so enjoyable.Imagine if the Milky Holmes detectives were actually competent and solved real mysteries. That’s what you’ll get in this alternative episode. In short, the four Milky Holmes girls solve a mystery in London with the help of their mentor, Kobayashi Opera. Sounds like a recipe for a good bit of fun, right?Well, not really. The episode is, in a word, dull. The girls’ new competence is a double-edged sword:...while it is interesting to see Milky Holmes using their toys properly for the first time, the humor that accompanies their usual clumsiness and air headedness becomes absent. The mystery is also nothing to write home about; it’s not especially clever and is typical Saturday morning cartoon kind of fare.The art is what you’d expect for Tantei Opera Milky Holmes: colorful and cutesy. The animation is decent but has noticeably less energy than that of the original series. The music, including the new ending song, is forgettable.All in all, this is a very subdued, tamed version of Milky Holmes, lacking the wackiness and humor of the earlier seasons. If you are a fan of the series, you might want to watch this just to see Kobayashi, who makes his first real anime appearance here, but there’s not much more to see here beyond that. For newcomers, this special can be readily watched without seeing the parent series, but I would highly recommend watching the original series first to get more familiarity and attachment with the characters. while it is interesting to see Milky Holmes using their toys properly for the first time, the humor that accompanies their usual clumsiness and air headedness becomes absent.

There were less laughs and random stupidity in this series. I felt like I was watching something different. While watching this, I realized that Milky Holmes isn\'t complete without Kokoro-chan shouting her usual catchphrase of ""Don\'t call me Kokoro-chan"" and Henriette Mystere with her big ""boing-boing"".Okay so I spoiled you a bit. Yes, there\'s no appearance (hell, there\'s no room) for Kokoro-chan nor Henriette...here so for their fans, you\'ll get disappointed if you watch this because of the lack of screen time for them.What can I say about the story is so far, this is the best plot line I\'ve ever seen for Milky Holmes. I recommend that you understand the story again and again. It\'s like Milky Holmes meets Detective Conan\'s hard to solve cases.Conclusion, if you remove Milky Holmes\' uselessness, you\'ll get much, much more uselessness. Then again, if you really are a big fan of Milky Holmes, you should watch this just so you could add this to your anime list. here so for their fans, you\'ll get disappointed if you watch this because of the lack of screen time for them.What can I say about the story is so far, this is the best plot line I\'ve ever seen for Milky Holmes.

Watch the Alternative. These two episodes are the 180 of Milky Holmes. It shows what would have happened if they had never lost their Toys. Honestly, if this is what Milky Holmes was, it would would probably be one of my favorites.Milky Holmes goes to London to visit their old teacher Opera Kobayashi. Except instead of being useless, they are well on their way to becoming full fledged detectives. There is more plot than comedy,...but the comedy is still as slapstick as ever. They meet Adler and the british version of Kokoro. Together, they must recover five mysterious paintings and unlock their secret.The Alternatives are more serious than the anime, and lack Arsene, Phantom Thief empire, and G4. However it is still really good. The story is a little under developed since it only had two episodes, but is really good. If you want to see what Milky Holmes would be if they weren\'t stupid, useless, idiots, this is the anime to watch! but the comedy is still as slapstick as ever.

Temple Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/56741/Temple_Specials,"['A must watch if you enjoyed the shenanigans of the main anime, the special has all the cast we love put in the same weird and sexy situations, here more than before.Credit given to this episode for using surreal comedy, stuff we barely had prior to it, now it\'s full absurdity after absurdity which creates a hot and spicy ecchi scenario and laughter. The ""drama"" of the temple is forgotten or just not mentioned, think of it like it\'s funny segment from the daily lives of our characters.The only thing I will complain is the use of censorship, I\'m talking about stickers covering the important...parts of the naked girls, we may never know why it\'s like this but it\'s kinda annoying if you\'re an ecchi fan and wanna see some sexiness, in the end they could have used better angles to hide the juicy spots in order for the censorship not to appear so intrusive. Then again, it\'s only a few shots.The overall quality of visuals is the same as the original, same art style of course, very colorful and uncomplicated, classic harem character design that balances on the border between cheap and acceptable (like one of my friends told me).I recommend it to all Temple fans and comedy fans, you can also watch it as an introduction to the show, just keep in mind that the TV anime has a bit of character drama and it has a flow while this episode is pure randomness. parts of the naked girls, we may never know why it\'s like this but it\'s kinda annoying if you\'re an ecchi fan and wanna see some sexiness, in the end they could have used better angles to hide the juicy spots in order for the censorship not to appear so intrusive.

Souryuuden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1742/Souryuuden,"[""First off, this anime is quite old, and I supose people will kinda only really like this, if they are hardcore anime fans and can apprecaite its old, or people who saw it when it first came out.The story is about 4 brothers who each have a hidden power to turn into a dragon, each dragon has 1 element, such as fire, or wind. The brothers at the start of the anime don't know they have this power. The story is basically about an organzation that knows of the brothers powers and trys to capture them, thus leading to the brothers knowledge that there are...dragon kings.It sounds quite basic, but there is a nice plot twist in there.The characters aren't that special to be honest, although I'd say most people will be able to pick a favorite out of the brother character, and there isn't really much devolpement between the brothers but there is regarding their dragon powers.The art isn't going to blow you away, since it's an old show, but for it's time it wasn't bad at all. The sound from what I can remember does it's job, but compared to new anime it wont be spot on.However with all that being said, there is a certain enjoyment in this anime, and I'm not sure what it is, I think the creator must have had great passion for his work, and you will find it a joy to watch, I know i did. however I wouldn't recomend a rewatch if you saw it when it first came out, and this is the anime that hooked you into anime, as it hasn't aged that well.Overall, Give it a watch if you're a huge anime fan and must see everything, It won't blow you away, but I don't think you find it that bad, and you'll find some enjoyment in here. dragon kings.It sounds quite basic, but there is a nice plot twist in there.The characters aren't that special to be honest, although I'd say most people will be able to pick a favorite out of the brother character, and there isn't really much devolpement between the brothers but there is regarding their dragon powers.The art isn't going to blow you away, since it's an old show, but for it's time it wasn't bad at all.

What the hell happened!!!!! was it all a dream instead or something...blew almost my bloody head apart because in an instand it switched from the brothers fighting, to the dragons realm and seems acting like nothing, or something supposed to happen !!!!! wth just too weird , but overall a action packed serie, still one of my all time fav. other dragonkings,in this case on earth the ranking goes from young to old cuz they are reincarnations.Artwise the animation looks ok for 1991 standards, but detailed enough, very good handdrawing when it comes to dragons ofc and i had the feeling that a lot of shoddy 80´s habit in the animation was mostly gone, and looks colourful enough to see stuff clear.The intro and the outro was for me the whole thing   about music for me, and one of my most fav intro of all time.Most of the charachters were interesting enough to make a small or big diffrence, kept the fun in and developed ther sort of own personality dring the show, heroes, dragons and villians alike, even more so that the villians back story was way more darker and interesting than some of the good guys, but the 4 brothers def stole most of the show when i came to transforming, or even restrain to doing so.It was entertaining for the most part until the end!!Until the last episode i had my fun, but then it looked like sort of....

More often than not, getting anime recommendations by googling names off random people characters on a Japanese game is so much more useful than asking the MAL community. Hey look, you'd think because this was also done by the guy that did LOGH more people would've seen it. WOwI have heard of the 東方青龍 南方紅龍 西方白龍 北方黑龍, but greatly done in this anime (watch Sub)Anyways Ryudo Hajime and Ryudo Tsuzuku are damn epic and badass. See Hajime and Tsuzuku 10/10I recommend Black Jack OVA and Petshop of Horrors for more amazing 90s atmosphere and characters like Souryuuden. For more modern...like Souryuuden, when the brothers pushed to the brink and transform into dragons it is LIT just like Eren must become the Titan to fight in Attack on Titan. like Souryuuden, when the brothers pushed to the brink and transform into dragons it is LIT just like Eren must become the Titan to fight in Attack on Titan.""]"
Time Travel Shoujo: Mari Waka to 8-nin no Kagakusha-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33341/Time_Travel_Shoujo__Mari_Waka_to_8-nin_no_Kagakusha-tachi,"[""Literally a Saturday morning show ( airing at 7 AM JST ) it tells the story of Mari, a middle schooler, and her friend Waka as they travel to different times in our history and meet some of the most influential inventors in human history while trying to find Mari's dad.The show is aimed at children so don't expect any mature themes from it, but it's still well made and fun enough that it can be enjoyed by everyone. This also means the show avoid the usual anime cliché tropes and instead gives us a very likable cast of characters who are very fun to...watch and easy to like.As I mentioned above the show revolves around Mari a middle schooler who's dad has been missing for three years. Before leaving, her dad gave her a necklace that, as it turns out, is a part of a time traveling machine. By pure accident Mari ends up traveling back in time to 1600 and meeting William Gilbert, who amongst other things tells her that he has met her father. The show then revolves around Mari traveling back and forth in time to unravel the mysteries of the time machine and find her time traveling dad.The show strongest point is the characters, all of them very likable, and the appearance of several inventors and their stories and interactions with the cast, as the show likes to show not only the inventions but give you some personal information about them, like how Bell invented the telephone because of his work with the deaf ( as his wife was deaf ) which helps give their inventions context and makes it feel less like just a history book and more like a proper story.Animation wise the show is quite well done and while it's not going to blow your mind, it's always consistent and you won't see any QUALITY. What's noteworthy in the visual aspect is the excellent reaction faces the characters use when they are surprised, sad, etc. Maybe it's because it's aimed at children but this aspect is very well done and their faces are all very expressive and funny to watch.The music in pretty average, it doesn't really stand out but it's never intrusive. The VA work is quite good with lots of familiar names. Overall the audio aspect of the show is slightly above average.The show also has small clips at the end of each episode where they show a real life video of one of the inventions featured during the episode and give small explanations on how they work.Overall the show is quite easy to enjoy if you want something that's pretty relaxing and funny, especially if you like to see time travel stories that feature historical figures related to electricity and magnetism. watch and easy to like.As I mentioned above the show revolves around Mari a middle schooler who's dad has been missing for three years.

While I think Time Travel Shoujo would not be completely immune of this from some people, I do think it\'s possibly the strongest Edutainment series I\'ve seen to date, and could still be something those that generally don\'t care for them would enjoy.~STORY~ (7/10)Believe it or not, this is easily the strongest part of this series, as it actually manages to tell a quite adept story all things considered. While it\'s not immune of plot holes and logical flaws, as nearly every time travel story is, the other aspects...manage to prevent it from being a frustrating mess. For what I can only assume is an anime directed at younger audiences give it\'s educational touch, it throws some relatively darker elements at the viewer in some unexpected ways. While the specific single episode stories with each scientist Mari visits can be hit or miss, the over-arching plot manages to remain interesting and keep the viewer hooked from a fairly early point in the anime.~CHARACTERS~ (6/10)With a few exceptions, the whole cast is quite likable. For younger audiences they seem like they\'d be quite easy to relate to and provide as decent ""role models"", which is good for an Edutainment anime, while for older audiences they play off the events and lessons well to bring you back to younger days. When it comes to how they work with the more serious, over-arching plot, they do tend to shine a little less though, as most fall into fairly standard roles. And while the primary antagonist brings about some pretty adult themes for an anime directed at this kind of audience, he still doesn\'t manage to be anything all that special compared to most villains in anime. Still, the characters are not by any means bad, they simple just don\'t stand out as much as they could\'ve.~ART~ (4/10)The art and animation of this series can get pretty lazy at times. When characters are just standing around and talking it\'s usually not that noticeable, but in any high action moments it becomes much more obvious as the inconsistencies begin to shine through. Heck even the opening sequence, which usually in anime has some of the best animation, is quite questionable. It doesn\'t manage to distract from the enjoyment of the show too much, but once in a while you take notice, and there\'s really never any moments of impressive animation to make up for it.~SOUND~ (5/10)While I don\'t have much negative to say here, I also don\'t have much to say positively either. The voice acting and music do their job and that\'s about it, nothing more or less. The only thing that really stood out to me is one insert song that sometimes plays before a character travels through time. It\'s actually quite nice, but it loses it\'s charm after you\'ve heard it a few times.~ENJOYMENT~ (6/10)Despite some iffy aspects to the production side of things, this was still a really nice watch. I didn\'t have terribly high hopes for it going in as Edutainment stuff generally doesn\'t have a lot to offer, but the surprisingly well written story it offered outside of those educational elements definitely deserves a bit of praise.

Girl discovers father\'s time travel machine and goes back in time to find her father with the help of her neighbours. Evil organisation is hunting down her father as well. Not the most original plot, but it\'s a mere device to explore the history of science in every episode, with a real life explanation of how the theory works at the end of the episode after the credits.The writer made it as close to history as possible, and kept the small details (Things...you never knew you never knew) like Michael Faraday forgetting to credit Davy and Wollaston for his thesis, Ben Franklin arguing with the local pastor over installing lightning rods on churches, and Thomas Edison marketing the first commercial toaster as CEO of GE. I\'m giving the writer props just for the research alone.That said. This isn\'t just science. This is history AND science. There are some parts which only adults will understand and make little sense for modern kids like Mari, like the existence of uneducated black slaves in 1800s America, and the suppression of heretical scientific discoveries by the Pope before the Enlightenment era.Art, Sound - 6 (Fair)Standard fare. Nothing particularly good or bad stands out.Character - 7Nothing too annoying in the beginning considering the main characters are just children. Over the series, they learn the value of hard work for different motives altogether, and how hard work applies to everything in life. MC starts to like science but she\'s bad at science.

For the same sick and twisted reason, it is also...suitable for people who are tired of the medium; it has some tropes you\'ll undeniably be familiar with, but nothing worth giving up hope for.At worst, it is an average show, and at best (its first and last episodes), it is just good—that roughly averages out to a nice, solid ""decent"", and so long as you\'re willing to accept that, I would say it\'s worth your time.What\'s best about the show is that it uses its educational context to form a one-of-a-kind time travel narrative that would not be feasible outside of the unquestioning nature that a Saturday morning cartoon provides, relaying the story of a child travelling through history in search for her missing father. Meanwhile, a corporate mystery unfolds as a businessman attempts to track down the very same father figure, and the convergence of these two storylines happens in a very satisfying and unexpected fashion.Once the story grabs you, it\'s easy to forget about the cookie-cutter nature of what characters are key to the story, but there are still a few outliers sprinkled throughout. Most of these flaws are exclusive to the children in the anime, so there\'s always the possibility of it being an intentional choice made to exemplify the lack of individuality of a mind that is still maturing.Nevertheless, MariWaka is not a psychological venture, so there\'s no need to get into that—I would most likely recommend the series to those looking for something new and fun to watch, especially if you\'re able to forgive a little roughness around the edges.Sometimes a lack of perfection is what is most perfect about a work, and if you can see the appeal in that, you have probably attained humility. suitable for people who are tired of the medium; it has some tropes you\'ll undeniably be familiar with, but nothing worth giving up hope for.At worst, it is an average show, and at best (its first and last episodes), it is just good—that roughly averages out to a nice, solid ""decent"", and so long as you\'re willing to accept that, I would say it\'s worth your time.What\'s best about the show is that it uses its educational context to form a one-of-a-kind time travel narrative that would not be feasible outside of the unquestioning nature that a Saturday morning cartoon provides, relaying the story of a child travelling through history in search for her missing father.

All this despite uncomfortable aspects like a what should have been 40 year old but depicted younger Benjamin Franklin flirting with a school girl.The opening is not it is strong, but it has a nice chibi closing.', 'Time Travel Girl at the start was a pleasant surprise among the Summer anime season.  By the end, I have some major criticisms, but still, I enjoyed the ride.  It had a likeable set of characters and interesting premise.  It was strict to formula, but was never overly ambitious.  Each episode left me feeling satisfied and a want to continue, for the first nine episodes at the least.  Then, I just trekked through the rest.The formula is usually one episode focused on one of the eight scientists, though sometimes two for a certain few of them.  There\'s a certain...situation or issue happening that concerns the protagonist Mari in the present.  Her issue will ""coincidentally"" match with the scientist in the past, even sometimes with the scientist giving her words of wisdom, providing the lesson of the day.  Lastly, when she returns, she takes the words to heart and moves forward.  It\'s pretty straightforward in it\'s approach, not surprising since this anime is targeted for kids.  However, even as mostly a kids show, the series had elements even a 26 year old like myself could invest into.  The level of accuracy in the portrayal of the history presented is astounding, really showing the work on the writers\' part.  The only disappointing one was the last one where the story shifts to resolving a subplot that\'s been built up throughout the series.The characters are also enjoyable.  The main duo Mari and Waka are easy to get behind.  They have enough personality to where they aren\'t just a stereotype of a overused cliche.  Even the businessman Mikage who serves as the main antagonist has shades of a personality and isn\'t a caricature one-dimensional bad guy, that is until the climax when he\'s degraded into the latter.However, for this storyline to work while taking into account child viewership, some contrivances were taken.  When the time traveling occurs, the people of the past that witness Mari or Waka suddenly appearing in a gulf of blue light react only with a seconds worth of shock before accepting it, and take the idea they are from the future at face value at first before accepting it later on.  The dress of both Mari and Waka in the past only gets a few comments that it\'s shameful due to the short skirt, but it doesn\'t draw as much attention as you would think it would.  And again, this is so the show can focus on what\'s intended.There\'s plenty of plot convenience as well.  I already mentioned the coincidence on how each issue introduced in the beginning of the episode manages to coincide with the scientist the protagonist would be meeting later on.  In addition, Mari, for the first six trips, always accidentally activates the time machine.  Shun, the oldest of the group and Waka\'s brother, is the one to suggest Mari shouldn\'t tell her mother about the time traveling.  Furthermore, no sane wife would still be married to a husband who she has not seen or heard from for 3 YEARS.The climax is also pretty weak.  The antagonist who was morally grey beforehand jumps of the slippery slope to be the ""bad guy"" of the series.  He\'s evil because he wants to use the time machine for profit, and intended to use the protagonist as a hostage against her dad to make him cooperate, but then midway, he changes his mind to instead prevent her dad from returning, which doesn\'t make sense since he himself said he needed the dad to work and maintain the time machine.  And even that becomes unnecessary as plot happens to make sure one of them can\'t get back anyway.  Guess who?  The guy ends up being a poor antagonist, as in the end, he really doesn\'t do anything, and is just an excuse to add conflict in the story where there were other alternatives.  For instance, actually have the future change because of the interventions of Mari, Waka, or Mari\'s father.  Mentioned before, it\'s pure plot convenience, how nothing they said or did changed the future e.g. appearing right in front of people after time leaping, letting the scientists know they were going to make a difference, the clothes they\'re wearing, showing off future technology, etc.And then the confrontation concludes with Mari recalling each scientist, and preaching essentially the theme of the series.  Again, it\'s marketed towards kids; it\'s understandable, but comes off as a forced way to spread the show\'s message, one that was already iterated quite a few times already throughout the series.  Also, there\'s the blatant diversion off of Mari\'s dad\'s misuse of the time machine by making Mikage act caricaturely evil.  Even if some good came out of it and he fixed any time inconsistencies he unintentionally caused, Eiji was still time hopping  for his self interest to witness major scientific discoveries and in the end, these events lead to his family having no contact with him for three years.  The anime tries to lesson it with time travel ""logic"" by the one we meet being the one from three years ago and it\'s this version that returns to the present.  Also, it tries to mitigate it by having the wife unleash her fury at him.  However, all of it is to simplify and handwave the main issue, not to mention adding the plot hole of why Mari\'s dad from three years ago doesn\'t return to his timeline but instead jumps to the present.For a kid\'s anime, Time Travel Girl is fairly average.  It wants to provide education and inspire children to take an interest in science.  In that aspect, it does things well.  After each episode, there\'s a cute segment with chibi versions of Mari, Waka and Mari\'s dad that explain what was discussed in the episode in more detail, with real life presentations and examples. On the other hand, it also tries to add a deeper story subplot with Mikage in an attempt to add tension, but fails in this regard.  In the end, he becomes an inept villain meant to act as scapegoat to divert attention away from Mari\'s dad, and the confrontation ends with a speech that wasn\'t natural to reiterate the story\'s theme. situation or issue happening that concerns the protagonist Mari in the present.

Outside of Mari's encounters with famous inventors like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison, the series adds to the education theme by having segments at the end of each episode that demonstrate the means by which each of the inventions function.In regards to the historical exploration from Time Travel Girl, the series believably depicts its time periods from...the fashions to the societies to how technologies are utilized. The series aims to show the challenges that each inventor had during their time period with getting their work accepted by others, trying to get their invention to work, or working through perseverance to get the results they are seeking. It shows through hard work and perseverance, these famous inventors were able to create their inventions and this gradually led to further advancements with the ideas and concepts discovered through them. Mari serves as a sort of viewer surrogate to learn about these inventors through her time travels and gradually develops an admiration for the hard work they put into contributing their inventions. The experience of viewing this is informational enough as such where even older audiences may learn some new things on inventors they may have forgotten or never learned of in school.Outside of the focus on historical figures, the series also takes the time to focus on other characters within Mari's life. While a bit simple in characterization, they are still mostly likeable and help add some levity to get away from the anime's educational focus. It also adds an element of mystery to the anime as Mari does learn her father has connections to the time travel technology that she uses and tries to figure out what his connection to it is.This said, Time Travel Girl does carry its fair share of issues. Perhaps a big one is that the series does have a fair number of logical holes with how its time travel gimmick is implemented as it disregards any focus on potential ramifications for the future timeline by intervening in historical events and doesn't really get too deep into the particulars of plot elements like how the time machine was created, thus some suspension of disbelief is needed to enjoy the educational value of the series. The show's attempt to add in a villain in the form of businessman Joe Mikage felt out-of-place for the intended focus of the anime. Also, the visuals to the series are nothing impressive as there are a decent number of still shots employed and character designs are on the plain side.Still for edutainment, Time Travel Girl offers solid engagement in its focus on famous Western inventors and showing that history and science can be engaging and beneficial to learn, something that younger and older audiences could appreciate. the fashions to the societies to how technologies are utilized.

Time Travel Shoujo: Mari Waka to 8-nin no Kagakusha-tachi is essentially an edutainment anime, mostly focusing on science by a Japanese highschooler time traveling back to eras of important scientists like Graham Bell and Benjamin Franklin.As a basis for an anime focused on entertaining kids about the ""beauty"" of science, for the most part, they do it decently, making the entire time traveling both playful and ""educational"", but oddly enough there is a subplot that seems more serious than the genre gives us (secret organization...after the main protagonist\' father and his time machine comes to mind).In terms of characters, we got our typical highschool girls of Mari Hayase voiced by Aki Toyosaki and Waka Mizuki voiced by Minako Kotobuki and the plethora of scientist and really with Mari being the eccentric type and Waka being the more grounded one to Mari are rather typical, with even the obvious life messages the anime is trying to bring out through like ""failures"", ""expectations"" and ""trying our hardest"", the scientists they meet and somewhat give the main characters a bit of development. As such Mari and Waka do go through development by using the time travel and learning things from the scientist they meet that reflect their own dilemma\'s, sure it\'s by the book but it still works. However ironically as they do look at scientist\'s dilemma\'s due to the dozen or so scientists, the majority of them don\'t get development and a little more than plot devices for the main characters to learn their lesson or revelation. (It was to be expected as much of a flaw it is, LA can easily overlook this). Can LA just say that Mari\'s mother Akira voiced by Haruka Tomatsu becomes a hidden badass later on and quickly gained LA\'s respect, unfortunate that it came by the final episode nonetheless. The anime also goes into the function of the the time traveling through the compass and ""how it works"" which gets expositioned by Shun, Waka\'s older brother and is the ""bridge bunny"" to their antics. Mari\'s own storyline does focus more on finding Mari\'s lost father and gives her a reason to time travel to find out where her ""present-day"" father is...yeah LA won\'t get into detail about THAT mess.Which comes up a good point, LA did feel like there was a bit of a paradox concerning the time machine, how did it get there?...if it was from the future, how did it get to Mari\'s father lab in the present time WHILE having Mari\'s father in the time machine helping scientist like Mari does?...LA is just sayin\'. On speaking of plot holes, LA will say that ALOT of these time traveling antics might come of as inconsistent in terms of actual historical events and to that, LA will say that ""isn\'t most of history have inconsistencies depending on who\'s perspective we see""?...thus LA could overlook if this anime ever did, the show isn\'t a history lesson as it is a science lesson and the scientist\'s dilemma\'s looked at.As for the ""villain"" of this anime..yeah because this anime just HAVE to have a villain about a time traveling girl to see scientist who made the modern world what it is, what is this? Steins;Gate?...... However as soon as LA said that, LA wanted to quickly rebutt this argument by saying that yes, this anime is aimed at kids, so WHY NOT having a secret organization after a time traveling machine, LA isn\'t saying this to demean the ""edutainment"" genre or it ""being for kids"", but LA is saying that IT CAN do this, it\'s aimed at kids and as long as it gives both enjoyment and education about science, then why not have this to grab the attention of kids and try to make them learn about science (well more like how to be successful using life lessons that scientist also went through but semantics here). The more attention grabbing it can get, the better it is...because seriously WHY NOT?.In terms of animation, the animation is overall very decent with most of the best animation coming from the time machine, the character designs are vibrant and expected poppy in contrast to the duller grayer ""earlier time traveling"" places, though the aesthetics to the time traveled places aren\'t that bad either. The animation is ""ok"" overall but the mechanical features of the time machine look very polished.In terms of voice acting, Aki Toyosaki was LA favourite voice actor in this anime as she did decently throughout the anime and Mianko Kotobuki who voiced Waka isn\'t that bad either though she goes into a slight ""whiny territory"" and once again Mari\'s mother Haruka Tomatsu gets special mention. (also hi ""Sphere"" being reunited in this anime), LA really doesn\'t have much to say about the voice cast besides the ""villain"" of the ""suave"" Joe Mikage voiced by Tomohiro Tsuboi..but LA really couldn\'t say much about the voice cast overall.The ending, well with all the hints given, the ending was predictable to say the least, what the major villain fate however felt it was more cruel than ""couldn\'t do anything sorry"". The lead up to this and the themes Time Travel Shoujo was doing does present itself pretty well, it\'s the expected scientist vs. patent shown clearly as Mari & her father vs. Joe Mikage beliefs, LA DOES understand that Mikage\'s fate was unpredictable and again cruel but the irony to his fate makes him a more sympathetic character...as much of a ""shrewd business man"" he was before this ending occurred. The ending is overall decent enough to portray the message it was trying to given off even at the cost of character\'s fate and another\'s ""happy ending""Time Travel Shoujo: Mari Waka to 8-nin no Kagakusha-tachi for an ""edutainment"" anime, it did it\'s job of telling life messages of success and failures through it\'s time traveling antics and meeting scientists and reflecting that onto it\'s main characters, sure the anime is aimed at kids but LA will say that it does cater to kids and doesn\'t belittle or insult them, it brings out it\'s message for the day, says some science facts and melds them together with the main characters with the attention grabbing storyline of the secret organization trying to use it for their own greedy needs to seal it as a decent anime in the edutainment genre. after the main protagonist\' father and his time machine comes to mind).In terms of characters, we got our typical highschool girls of Mari Hayase voiced by Aki Toyosaki and Waka Mizuki voiced by Minako Kotobuki and the plethora of scientist and really with Mari being the eccentric type and Waka being the more grounded one to Mari are rather typical, with even the obvious life messages the anime is trying to bring out through like ""failures"", ""expectations"" and ""trying our hardest"", the scientists they meet and somewhat give the main characters a bit of development.

It\'s full of very important scientists and it shows good morals all aroundStory 8/10While the story is kind of sketchy on the start )read- how the hell can they do that), it develops really nicely in the end. The scientists that they show us are very inspiring people and every time they introduce a new one, they show an experiment or two that they\'re holding at that time.Art 8/10The art is a good mix of 2D and 3D, as is usual. The characters are very moe (probably due to the age of the target...audience) which limits their face details. The dresses and uniforms that they use are very detailed and accurate for the times which is nice as well. The animation is fluid, especially around the time travel parts. Also, damn all the male characters are p hot as well.Sound 7/10The voice actors did a good job, but that\'s all I can say. There isn\'t really anything to set it apart from everything else. The music (apart from the OP and ED) is rarely used which I find disappointing considering they go in past where they could use classic-style music.Characters 8/10The characters are well defined and in the end, none of the characters are perfect which I like. The scientists are my favourites in here because of how they interact with the MC\'s and they basically accidentally help them solve major life crises (and the opposite happens are well). As for the main antagonist, he isn\'t all that ""black"" as you would think and I appreciate what they did about his ""demise"" in the end.Enjoyment 10/10Being an electro-technics student, I very much enjoyed watching this anime. I actually learned a few things from it as well (namely how a morse machine works :P). The characters are good and the story kept me going until the very end.

The scientists are my favourites in here because of how they interact with the MC\'s and they basically accidentally help them solve major life crises (and the opposite happens are well). As for the main antagonist, he isn\'t all that ""black"" as you would think and I appreciate what they did about his ""demise"" in the end.Enjoyment 10/10Being an electro-technics student, I very much enjoyed watching this anime. I actually learned a few things from it as well (namely how a morse machine works :P). The characters are good and the story kept me going until the very end. Since I am also a fan of isekai-esque shows, this was right up my alley.', 'I watched all 12 episodes of Time Travel Shoujo: Mari Waka to 8-nin no Kagakusha-tachi. Here are my thoughts:I have very little to say about this anime. This is basically the Japanese equivalent of an educational TV show that a school teacher might throw on when they\'re feeling lazy or something. It literally aired on Saturday morning and is targeted to a child audience. I mainly just watched it while I was eating breakfast.The educational focus of the show is on electricity and magnetism. There are various relevant experiments that get incorporated into the show, and there are also some short educational segments at the...end of each episode. For me, the most amusing aspect of the anime was the incorporation of various western historical figures into the cast, like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison. The use of these characters in an anime was entertaining enough to keep me watching.Otherwise though, the anime was pretty bad. I mean, it\'s literally a kid\'s show. The plot was groan-worthy. The characters were very simplistic. The art style and animation were unremarkable. It seems perfectly fine as a kids\' ""edutainment"" show, but for me personally it was bad.My rating: 4/10Worth it though to see Benjamin Franklin as an anime character. Lol. end of each episode.

Can we completely forget the past and count on a better future?Don't worry, from now on I will only write in English and not in Chinese.Each of us has words inside that we would like to say but cannot. Each of us has dreams that we want to achieve, but sometimes we cannot. Each of us has a certain person who we love above everything. The anime poses itself with all these questions.The first season definitely has to be watched to understand all...the actions that are going on in the second season. It is a continuation of it.STORY & CHARACTERS:The story of our two main protagonists 佟 离 (Tong Li) and 江 小白 (Jiang Xiao Bai) continues. After the end of the first season, where they found each other, everything seems to be great again. But our lovers also meet new and old problems from the past. Can what happened at school back then with the accident of 穆 夕 雨 (Mu Xi Yu) simply be forgotten and looked into a bright future? Even though our protagonists love each other more than anything else in the world, difficult decisions about the future still have to be made. How are their jobs going? Can a good collaboration continue?We also get to know new characters and their touching background stories. These also had to go through a hard time in their life. All of these questions and many more will be answered here in the second season.ART:I am a big fan of the Chinese anime industry because I can understand everything  without subtitles. But the animation here clearly shows that it cannot keep up with the Japanese production. It is the most flawed thing. There are still too many problems, which creates the feeling that it is not completely fluid.SOUND:Beautiful, touching, brilliant. I have to be honest on this point and say that the songs are only super to listen if you can understand Chinese. The music itself is very too, but without understanding the text I can hardly imagine that it will have a big impact. In Chinese music, the lyrics are always of great importance and you have to understand their true meaning here too.ENJOYMENT:In comparison to the first season weaker, the story is no longer so creative and exciting. Still, I really liked the anime. Not only I did see a good continuation from the first part and enjoyed great music, I also learned something about the city  Chongqing 重庆. I personally have never been to the 30 million people city, but I would love to go on a trip there. You should not expect it to look as empty as in the anime. Free places on the train? There is practically no such thing in China. So if someone is going to visit China, many, many, many people are there.All in all, I had a lot of fun watching the sequel. It can't keep up with the first season, but it's a very good work. The only (and very much) thing that bothers me is the art and it's style.The anime has still not been translated with eng sub and it probably won't come, which is a shame.

Arc the Lad,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55/Arc_the_Lad,"[""Arc the Lad, the adventure show that's just a touch darker then others of its type.StoryThe story follows a young hunter named Elk and his quest for revenge against the infamous Arc. Although it starts off simply, things gradually grow more complex as soon as our so called antagonist enter the picture. Still the main point of this series is to show the growth of Elk and the heroine Lieza as characters. What can revenge do to a person, what can being overwhelmed by hatred hope to accomplish? Though these may be questions that other shows have presented as well, it's executed well...here because Elk never comes across as insincere or forceful in his emotions. Deep down, he's a nice kid, he's just troubled with how he should handle himself. Some of the more traumatic events that happen certainly don't help things.CharactersThere is a lot of characters, too many in fact. Now this is based on a video game, so obviously it tried to incorporate everyone from the game, however it does leave a lot underdeveloped or underused due to the series's short length.Fortunately the characters are never annoying or terribly stereotypical, so the ones that do get used are executed in a fairly decent matter. The main focus is of course on Elk and Lieza as said before. Thankfully both get appropriate growth and bonding time, while the other characters mainly act as support or a moral compass for them. Elk isn't just a guy where revenge is everything to him and Lieza isn't just a hopeless damsel in distress thankfully. Maybe they aren't the most original characters in the world, but they aren't poorly written by any means.Art/Animation/SoundAll are fairly standard for the time. Nothing terribly impressive or original. The character designs are cool, but the animation is semi-lackluster which hurts the impact of some of the fight scenes.Enjoyment.Actually fairly enjoyable for an adventure show. It might start semi-slow but I can't say the show is ever that boring. Once the plot gets rolling it actually gets pretty exciting if you ask me. Some of the traumatic events that happen are kind of gut-wrenching, which I personally didn't expect from this show so kudos for the surprise. I enjoyed this adaption a lot more then game story if that says anything.Overall.It's nice to get a more mature adventure show every once in awhile. I really think with a tighter cast and a higher budget this could have been something a little more special.

There are multiple games in the Arc the Lad videogame series and the anime is an adaption of some sorts of the second video game: Arc the Lad II. I heard about the video game some 15 years ago because it is a name that is quite rememberable because it's a little silly sounding. I did not play the video games, so this is also the reason why I do not know in what way, shape or form this follows the second video game.At the start of the anime, it is pretty...clear that something happened in the near past (the first video game took place) and we follow a new protagonist named Elk who is out looking for revenge. The interesting thing here is that the protagonist is looking for revenge against the protagonist of the first game, who is introduced as a wanted criminal by the name of Arc.You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. What could be a very interesting perspective on how all well intended actions could have negative consequences, soon fades away as Elk learns the truth and ends up joining Arc's crew. From here on out the story could go in several standard coming-of-age-through- adventuring ways, but I was pleasantly suprised with the dark themes and character developments that were presented in the middle of the series. There are nice substories about a blind girl and a childhood friend of Elk which were very good and emotional. Towards the ending the story turns pretty generic though.There were some very disturbing visuals spread throughout the anime, which felt a bit out of place because they happen so sporadically. In a way it was almost as if the viewer has to be reminded that the world in which the heroes live is very harsh and unforgiven, even though the heroes are shown to have it pretty good and often appear quite overpowered compared to the chimeras they are fighting.Seeing as this is based on Arc the Lad II in a way, and there are more games after this, I thought this series was going to be open ended and even though not everything is resolved, I was pleasantly suprised by the feeling of closure at the end of the anime. Also the final battle felt very catastrophic with all the impending doom vibes and the magnitude of everything. It really felt like an animated playthrough of the final stage of a videogame!The quality of the animation takes quite a dip throughout the series and it is not just background characters, it is very notable unfortunately. The crew must have worked hard on the final two episodes because it shows in comparison to the few episodes before it. There are also a few goofs throughout the show, such as someone running off and in the next shot they are shown together again without further explanation. Nothing plot-shattering, but still noteworthy.I enjoyed Arc the Lad, what started as a generic shounen anime grabbed my attention back with it's violence and cruel substories halfway through and then returned to a generic shounen anime at the end.

Airbats - A Lighthearted Dive into Aviation ComedyRating: 7/10801 T.T.S. Airbats, directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and based on the manga by Shimizu Toshimitsu, takes a unique approach to the military genre by infusing it with a comedic and slice-of-life twist. Released in 1994, this OVA (Original Video Animation) series provides an entertaining yet somewhat niche experience for viewers interested in a blend of aviation, humor, and light-hearted storytelling.**Storyline (6/10):**Set in an alternate reality where the Tokyo Metropolitan Police maintains an all-female air squadron, 801 T.T.S. Airbats follows the misadventures of the charmingly eccentric pilot Isurugi Takuya and his squadmates. The series adopts...a largely episodic format, focusing on the day-to-day challenges faced by the Airbats and their interactions both on and off duty.While the premise is unique and the comedic elements add a refreshing touch to the military setting, the overall narrative lacks a strong central plot. The episodic nature can lead to a somewhat disjointed viewing experience, with individual episodes feeling like standalone comedic sketches rather than contributing to a cohesive overarching story.**Characters (6/10):**801 T.T.S. Airbats introduces a quirky and diverse set of characters, each with distinct personalities and quirks. Isurugi Takuya\'s carefree and flirtatious nature provides much of the comedic energy, while the other members of the Airbats contribute their own dynamics to the group. The character interactions are enjoyable, and their camaraderie is a highlight of the series.However, the characters often remain within the bounds of their established archetypes, with limited exploration of deeper character development. While this fits the lighthearted tone of the series, it may leave viewers wanting more substantial growth from the cast.**Animation and Art (7/10):**801 T.T.S. Airbats showcases animation typical of its 1990s era, with a somewhat dated aesthetic. The character designs and backgrounds capture the charm of the manga but may not meet the visual standards of more contemporary anime.

The detailed drawings of all things mechanical, the concept of the show itself and even the visual character design is great, but sadly the writing is abysmal. Because it was the ""style of the time"", they had to include a love triangle with the super-lame male protagonist, which forces all the female characters go head over heel about that dude for absolutely no reason...at all. That was a good way to ruin an otherwise solid show. I wonder if the manga is better? at all. That was a good way to ruin an otherwise solid show. I wonder if the manga is better?']"
Assault Lily: Bouquet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40550/Assault_Lily__Bouquet,"['Assault Lily Bouquet is an enjoyable story, but its enjoyment could run hollow.The story follows Riri Hitotsuyanagi, a new ""Lily"" student that joined the school to follow the person that saved her, Yuyu Shirai. However, the story is more complicated than that; we need to understand the concept of Lily, Charm, Huge, Garden, Rare Skill, Legions, Schutzangel, and that part is where the plot becomes messy.One of the most significant flaws in the series is the amount of information handled during the plot. These defects not only creates chaos, but they also affect the story with unnecessary threads. We can appreciate these defects...with the characters. They keep introducing characters every time without a proper background or need. I have been trying to find a good explanation, and my conclusion is Assault Lily Bouquet is just a prelude that introduces the setting of the incoming game that will be launch in January 2021. That reason explains the need to add condensed information in only twelve episodes. Despite these problems, the series can be enjoyable if you spend some time understanding the plot.On the other hand, the best, most exciting, and most poetic part of Assault Lily Bouquet the one section where Yuyu\'s feelings and her craziness side collides, leading to a fight toward artistry instead of just settling for commerce. The rest of this messy ""prelude"" is almost all commerce (fan service, unconcluded plot, etc) focused on the future game. As a positive part, how Yuyu\'s controlled her madness, the mystery surrounding her, and her relation with Riri kept me watching the story. The darkness developed in this part of the story is acceptable and at least worth the time. Meanwhile, additional information is misplaced. For example, Yuri\'s introduction could have been handled better, and there are several enigmas around her.Still, Assault Lily Bouquet does a moderately good job building an intriguing plot and an acceptable mystery. Some of the visuals are quite lovely: The characters\' design, some charms ideas, the backgrounds were the plot reaches the climax. Also, the sound is acceptable, has a score that does the job, and I cannot forget about the OP, Sacred World, which is excellent with good composition and rhythm.Finally, we like to compare this series with Granblem, Madoka, etc., and it could be a mistake. We should try to understand the plot elements and enjoy the relationship between Yuyu and Riri and how they work their problems to enjoy the story and avoid comparing with different franchises that will always lead to differences and discrepancy. Overall, Yuyu\'s main plot is good and will be worth your time, and why not? It will help you to decide if the future game is worth your time.Facts:Is this series popular? To date, the series is 18 on the Japanese TV ranking, and that isn\'t an awful position for a series that several viewers are considering a piece of garbage.

(These aren\'t the final season position yet, but I made my point)', 'Assault Lilly was a great ride from beginning to end, and was in my opinion, one of the sleeper hits of the season.Based on the dolls of the same name, Assault Lilly brought to characters from the toy line in the setting of a magical girls school to train girls to fight monsters. Basic premise, but really fun execution in my opinion. As a fan of Mahou Shoujo and general CGDCT, I thought Assault Lilly was another good addition to the genre. While the plot is not outstanding, it was well written enough for me to grow to love the girls, empathise with them when...they went through adversity and care about their development.I’m a simple man to please, so cute girls/waifus plus action, drama and yuri undertones are more than enough to satisfy me. If you’re looking for a really fleshed out story and world, you won’t find that in Assault Lilly. It’s very obvious that it was made to promote the toy line. That’s ok in my opinion, not everything has to be Homer or Socrates to be enjoyable. For what it is, Assault Lilly is great.My only real gripe about the series is the CGI. SHAFT do their usual job with the art, direction and everything else, but CGI was pretty subpar in this show in my opinion. I don’t think it’s a distraction, but it was definitely really noticeable in action sequences. Other than that, SHAFT did a great job as usual.With enjoyable characters, cute moments, action and enough thighs to satisfy the horniest of us, Assault Lilly was a thoroughly memorable experience and I will certainly miss it.

The show delivered what it promised from the first few episodes (i.e. thighs). The story isn't anything mind blowing, but I didn't expect it to have it in the first place. But the way it's presented will sure make you curious, and raise some questions, and make you think. If you don't want to think much, you'll still find it enjoyable. The art and animation is great, and Shaft has made a good use of 3DCG. I love the opening song, the...characters are funny and you'll remember their personalities and faces, not necessarily their names.There are so many characters and you'll see people complain about it, but you don't have to focus on them. They are not the main focus of the story but still if you're interested about them, you'll find something about them on the internet and the upcoming game. The show has its fun movement, sad moments and you'll see the main characters developed a lot by the end of the first season.The show is Yuri, Action, Thighs, Bath Scenes. No nudity or anything inappropriate though. There's handholding if you consider that lewd. Those are the selling points of the show. If you hate such type of material, honestly you're not going to like it. But still if you watch it and then complain about a not so original and average story, it's your fault. Watch it for great visuals, Shaft, and everything else I mentioned above. The show is nowhere near the other great works by Shaft, but the world it’s set in has potential. If I have to compare it with something, I’ll compare it Symphogear series. So if you like that, you’ll probably like this more. characters are funny and you'll remember their personalities and faces, not necessarily their names.There are so many characters and you'll see people complain about it, but you don't have to focus on them.

We have a similar high school setting to early RWBY -- hell we\'re introduced to our naive protagonist on her first day at the academy, and she immediately meets a rich heiress who eventually becomes a close friend. Like, it doesn\'t even try to hide this part -- episode 3 starts off by revealing everyone has a semblance... er sorry, ""Rare Skill"".However, that\'s still a fun enough...setting to play with, so maybe the characters will make up for it?Sorry, I can\'t even say that with a straight face. It took the first roll of the OP for me to figure out exactly who our main character Riri Hitotsuyanagi was going to be, even before the show introduced her.See, about a decade ago Shaft made this show you might\'ve heard of -- Madoka Magica. It was a big success -- and ever since then everyone and their dog has been trying to ride on its coattails. In other words, the magical girl genre has been consumed with innocent, pink-haired protagonists and cold dark-haired deuteragonists. I\'m not even saying Madoka invented this character dynamic, but it\'s hard to pin this on anyone else when it\'s been ingrained down to the designs. Yuki Yuna is a Hero, Granbelm, Magical Girl Raising Project -- even shows outside of the genre like Revue Starlight (well, mostly just the Homura part in that case). Not to say it\'s been completely cookie cutter -- some of them do a solid job of putting their own spin on it -- but it\'s been starting to get really stale. Half the time, you can take one glance at these characters and know exactly what\'s coming from them.Despite it being their own progeny, Shaft\'s been far from immune to this -- if anything they\'ve shown they have no problem playing even stronger into it than everyone else. Magia Record\'s main pair of characters were one of the clearest examples of this trend -- but even that was forgivable considering it was a Madoka spin-off.Assault Lily\'s just as blatant with no excuses to be found.If this was the first time I\'d seen it, I wouldn\'t care that much, but it\'s been a decade y\'all, come up with something else. I also don\'t actually think this character dynamic is that great -- especially the protagonist part -- and I love Madoka Magica. It plays well off Madoka\'s plot (which heavily drives Madoka\'s entire cast) and adds strong contrast, but put into most other shows it\'s really not that interesting. An innocent, pure, goody-two-shoes really isn\'t a very interesting POV for most stories, and this one hasn\'t really felt any different.The rest of the cast is a bunch of cliches that haven\'t really been fleshed out at all yet. I\'m expecting this show to just go the Magia Record route and have a bunch of mostly disconnected stories fleshing out the like, 15 named characters who mostly have significant effort put into their designs. Four episodes in, I can’t keep track of all of them, and I can barely even tell which ones are important to the show. I\'m also expecting to never care about most of the cast because there won’t be enough time to develop them meaningfully -- as is, the show has speedrun through Yuyu\'s character arc. Episode 4 also awkwardly shuffled into a new character’s arc just to speedrun through it even harder, so this is a concerning trend.Okay, but what about the production quality? Even Magia Record had that as a pretty strong saving grace, and Shaft has produced some of the prettiest and most stylistically memorable shows of the past ~decade (eg 3-gatsu no Lion, Madoka Magica, and the Monogatari series).It\'s... not bad? I certainly haven\'t had any issues with it. The opening\'s solid, the character designs are nice, the animation\'s felt fairly fluid... but I don\'t know, it\'s not really standing out to me. I feel bad complaining about it, but given we\'re talking Shaft, I can\'t help but want something more than this bland packaging.As for anything else about the writing, I\'ve been struggling to put my finger on why exactly, but the tone and direction of the show feel a little all over the place. For instance, I was expecting a darker shift in tone from the backstory of Yuyu, but the show didn\'t really build up towards that shift at all. It\'s been really light and comedic -- befitting of the high school-esque setting, but really strange when the show switches to a life-threatening fight against a \'Huge\'. For specific instances, the first episode has both Riri and Kaede almost get killed, or the third episode casually points out the Huge they\'re fighting has killed dozens of Lillies... and yet there\'s not really any tension or grit to the actual fights, and these details feel quickly forgotten. In general, the world-building has felt rather slap-dash and poorly thought-out/defined so far; that being said, it\'s only been a few episodes, so I can\'t really say that much yet.I really do hope this anime is able to pick up the slack and find its own voice in future episodes, but as of now I\'m starting to feel a little indifferent towards it. Shaft can certainly do a lot better than this. It\'s /okay/ for now, but I worry it\'s going to get more and more tired and insubstantial as time goes on -- especially with such a large cast awkwardly looming. There’s at least a certain cutesiness to the character interactions and their ‘yuri’ namesakes, but so far the show doesn’t really feel committed to this angle (or any angle, for that matter). setting to play with, so maybe the characters will make up for it?Sorry, I can\'t even say that with a straight face.

Easy complications molded her to take up the tutelage of Riri, establishing a contract between both of them in the form of Schutzengel and Schild (think of it like a parent-child relationship).- Kaede J. (Johan) Nouvel, a French girl whose family is the forefront manufacturer of the CHARM weapons. She\'s always envious of all the developing Yuri relationships and attempts to be the butt of all jokes. Of all the girls in the team, I genuinely love her ""intimidating"" character personality a lot, no joke about that!- Fumi Futagawa, the obsessed otaku of the Academy, if you have a question about Lilies, she\'s the go-to girl to watch out for.- Tazusa Andou, the alienating character when it comes to trust conflicts and the experimentation of her abilities as a ""Boosted Lily"", creating the harsh and taxing people-growth.- Mai Thi Yoshimura, a Vietnamese easy-going girl with a vibrant personality. Just don\'t troll her with tenacious trainings.- Kuo Shenlin, a Taiwanese girl who is kind to others and looks out for people, mainly her friend:- Wang Yujia, a Chinese girl whom is an introvert and needs reliance on people on the emotional front.- Miriam Hildegard von Gropius (just call her Gropi), a German girl whose genius status is unrivalled, but the same can be said for her extreme game addiction, much less a troublemaker.- Finally, the temporary member Yuri (I won\'t reveal how her name came about), made from a mix of both human and Huge DNA, though showing exemplary abilities of an Artificial Lily (while she lasted).Overall, not to worry if you forget who they are, because their names pop up ALL THE TIME to get you ""invested"" into their generic quirky character dynamics that make up the Hitotsuyanagi Team. Plus the other characters (of which I\'ll not mention because of the sheer number of them all), it paints both a fun and grim dramatic picture of relations that both explains and answers the only question: ""Who and what are you fighting for?"" It isn\'t a clear-cut case of just fighting against monsters, that\'s the very obvious-but-cliché part, and you can fill in the blanks of close speculation to accurate depiction of how all of this\'ll unfold.“The bitterest tears shed over graves, are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.” - Harriet Beecher StoweAnd since it\'s Shaft, in the 10 years (from the time of this review) ever since Madoka Magica came out, it has been the only studio to start the ""magical girls gone heavily dark"" craze structure right, and then seemingly just gave up its strong foothold altogether with the spin-off Magia Record. Since then and in-between, many others have tried to replicate the structure (see Yuuki Yuuna, Mahou Shoujo Raising Project, Granbelm among few others) to differentiating results of success. Assault Lily: Bouquet is no different, and the visual (both art and animation) style is almost symmetrical of the dark fantasy genre on both its setting and character designs, yet asymmetrical when it comes to everything else. This makes me wonder if the director\'s future work (of Luminous Witches) will have a direct copy-and-paste feature.“Analysis of death is not for the sake of becoming fearful, but to appreciate this precious lifetime.” - Dalai LamaThe sound design and music though is really good, and sadly the only area where I can praise in a sea of ""obligatory"" originality. I already know that RAISE A SUILEN has a monstrous fanbase in Japan (because of their BanG Dream!! foundations), and barring the Cardfight!! Vanguard theme songs, this is the all-female group\'s 1st ever theme song to hit mainstream anime, and NGL, it\'s a banger song to start the show alright. The Hitotsuyanagi Legion team of VAs coming back for the ED and it\'s a visual showcase of death flags here and there (along with some sweet Yuri, DUH).“In life, we weep at the thought of death. In death, perhaps we weep at the thought of life.” - Marilyn MonroeAs a whole, Assault Lily: Bouquet does only one thing right: add a number onto the onslaught of dark magical fantasy genre-based shows. Even if coupled with some decent action, this is still pretty tame by Madoka Magica standards, and the willingness of Shouji Saeki to even try is an admiration in itself, but I wouldn\'t push past against it. A mediocre-to-fine show if I can call it best, in an otherwise great effort of advertisement to potential fans that\'ll fap at anything Yuri-related.Ending this review on a positive note:“I joyfully await the exit – and I hope never to return.” - Frida Kahlo advertisement grow?Series Director Shouji Saeki: We can help think and pen down a fictional story based on your synopsis alone.

(Johan) Nouvel, a French girl whose family is the forefront manufacturer of the CHARM weapons. She\'s always envious of all the developing Yuri relationships and attempts to be the butt of all jokes. Of all the girls in the team, I genuinely love her ""intimidating"" character personality a lot, no joke about that!- Fumi Futagawa, the obsessed otaku of the Academy, if you have a question about Lilies, she\'s the go-to girl to watch out for.- Tazusa Andou, the alienating character when it comes to trust conflicts and the experimentation of her abilities as a ""Boosted Lily"", creating the harsh and taxing people-growth.- Mai Thi Yoshimura, a Vietnamese easy-going girl with a vibrant personality. Just don\'t troll her with tenacious trainings.- Kuo Shenlin, a Taiwanese girl who is kind to others and looks out for people, mainly her friend:- Wang Yujia, a Chinese girl whom is an introvert and needs reliance on people on the emotional front.- Miriam Hildegard von Gropius (just call her Gropi), a German girl whose genius status is unrivalled, but the same can be said for her extreme game addiction, much less a troublemaker.- Finally, the temporary member Yuri (I won\'t reveal how her name came about), made from a mix of both human and Huge DNA, though showing exemplary abilities of an Artificial Lily (while she lasted).Overall, not to worry if you forget who they are, because their names pop up ALL THE TIME to get you ""invested"" into their generic quirky character dynamics that make up the Hitotsuyanagi Team. Plus the other characters (of which I\'ll not mention because of the sheer number of them all), it paints both a fun and grim dramatic picture of relations that both explains and answers the only question: ""Who and what are you fighting for?"" It isn\'t a clear-cut case of just fighting against monsters, that\'s the very obvious-but-cliché part, and you can fill in the blanks of close speculation to accurate depiction of how all of this\'ll unfold.“The bitterest tears shed over graves, are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.” - Harriet Beecher StoweAnd since it\'s Shaft, in the 10 years (from the time of this review) ever since Madoka Magica came out, it has been the only studio to start the ""magical girls gone heavily dark"" craze structure right, and then seemingly just gave up its strong foothold altogether with the spin-off Magia Record. Since then and in-between, many others have tried to replicate the structure (see Yuuki Yuuna, Mahou Shoujo Raising Project, Granbelm among few others) to differentiating results of success. Assault Lily: Bouquet is no different, and the visual (both art and animation) style is almost symmetrical of the dark fantasy genre on both its setting and character designs, yet asymmetrical when it comes to everything else. This makes me wonder if the director\'s future work (of Luminous Witches) will have a direct copy-and-paste feature.“Analysis of death is not for the sake of becoming fearful, but to appreciate this precious lifetime.” - Dalai LamaThe sound design and music though is really good, and sadly the only area where I can praise in a sea of ""obligatory"" originality. I already know that RAISE A SUILEN has a monstrous fanbase in Japan (because of their BanG Dream!! foundations), and barring the Cardfight!! Vanguard theme songs, this is the all-female group\'s 1st ever theme song to hit mainstream anime, and NGL, it\'s a banger song to start the show alright. The Hitotsuyanagi Legion team of VAs coming back for the ED and it\'s a visual showcase of death flags here and there (along with some sweet Yuri, DUH).“In life, we weep at the thought of death. In death, perhaps we weep at the thought of life.” - Marilyn MonroeAs a whole, Assault Lily: Bouquet does only one thing right: add a number onto the onslaught of dark magical fantasy genre-based shows. Even if coupled with some decent action, this is still pretty tame by Madoka Magica standards, and the willingness of Shouji Saeki to even try is an admiration in itself, but I wouldn\'t push past against it. A mediocre-to-fine show if I can call it best, in an otherwise great effort of advertisement to potential fans that\'ll fap at anything Yuri-related.Ending this review on a positive note:“I joyfully await the exit – and I hope never to return.” - Frida Kahlo', ""There is a lot to say about how Assault Lily is so far, is it bad? Is it good? Well let me explain.I feel somewhat in the middle when it comes to Assault Lily so far, wouldn't say it's a bad anime, but it's a good one at best. Let's start off with the characters. We've got a wide bunch of a cast, with some interesting and deep backgrounds when it comes to some, but also with how the story that has been set up, it just makes you interested in a more in depth look on the characters, and what they can offer. Which...is good for a show. The characters have that going for them, but they're a bundle of personalities that really mesh well with one another. Along with the obvious Yuri vibes for even more extra fun. It's very cute and charming.As for the story itself, it's a fun plot so far, with how it's set up. So far considering where it's at, there isn't much to tell besides what it's set up at the start not that is a bad thing, but the school setting, and seeing what lillies are all about is still a good starting point, But I'm sure it'll go more deep as it goes along, and I cannot wait to see what in fact does happen.The art and sound are fitting for the moods, and also in terms of the art, are colourful, and nice and good to look at, cannot go wrong there.Would I say watch it? For sure, it's setting up stuff for now, which just gathers more interest, and you'll be keen to know what it's setting up is. is good for a show.

I particularly find fault in the protagonist Riri\'s naivety, to the point it\'s annoying. In cliche bishojo naivety, Riri follows her Onee-sama foil Yuyu in the path of a Lily, another bishojo-with-weapons warrior fighting against unknown enemies, like Madoka Magica, Brave Witches, or Toji no Miko.Unfortunately, unlike its superior brethren above, Assault Lily does not do anything to differentiate itself from the pack. It spends the first four episodes hanging worn tropes like teasing a ""secretly"" overpowered-protagonist, showing fanservice bathtowel scenes, and not fleshing out its protagonist outside of her interactions with her idol Yuyu. Riri is...obsessed with Yuyu to the point her interactions with other characters feel more like stepping stones to get closer to Yuyu rather than actual supporting characters to help her bring out more personality.That\'s not to say Riri is apathetic, she cares about Yuyu\'s wellbeing, but she\'s just so narrowmindedly naive to the core, she essentially denies herself of any characterization, to the point she\'s just a walking trope of a naive female protagonist (e.g. Yoshika of Strike Witches season 1).her pursuit of her heroine foil.But other than her unnatural Yuyu obsession (which other characters also point out once, but is overshadowed), Riri has no redeeming traits to her naiviety that borders on ego (that is pointed out once in the anime and then ignored after), and like most other naive protagonists, she finds a way to justify her want to help Yuyu even if it means prying into old wounds.Riri\'s initial relationship with the quiet, cynical and brooding Yuyu has her naivety challenged by Yuyu herself, who wants to ""teach"" the naive Riri about how cruel the world really is, but by episode 4, this foreshadowing loses its chance to appear as  Riri is quickly established as the calming Beauty to Yuyu\'s inner revenge-filled Beast, but the buildup to that moment is neither emotionally investing for the viewer, nor is it memorable.This anime would be a great modern day military retelling  of the whole Yuri genre\'s Onee-sama trope if it wasn\'t for the lack of depth in anyone except Yuyu herself, whose personality has turned from kind to cool girl from past trauma,in a Akemi Homura style of events.A weekly TV show needs to be interesting in its first half to have people care about it as much as its director(s) does, but if the director doesn\'t flesh out the characters properly, no one will care what happens to them next week. To be fair,  dramatic twists are typically executed in the latter half of an anime, but in order to keep an audience interested in watching a TV show on a weekly basis, even a anime like Assault Lily must have something that an audience can get invested in at the beginning. Like yuri-baiting or the cleavage fanservice for example, which the first half of this show has plenty of, though it isn\'t anything more than casual fanservice.Sound and Art are rated high because the chara design is beautiful, and the opening song memorable (it\'s played by Raise a Suilen of Bang Dream). The rest of the soundtrack however is forgettable.Overall, I disliked the protagonist\'s naiviety bordering on ego, and the lack of any characterization for anyone except her foil Yuyu. Assault Lily has the potential to be a bishojo-with-weapons interpretation of the classic onee-sama Yuri school genre (Maria sama ga Miteru, Strawberry Panic), but its lack of characterization and story hooks in the early half of the episodes wastes said story opportunities in favor of fanservice, fight scenes, and too many characters to remember or care about.Even hardcore fans of the genre might be hard-pressed to find a reason to watch Assault Lily for its characterization OR plot, as there is very little of it in the first four episodes.  Overall, Assault Lily has potential to shine on paper, but in execution it\'s inferior to its fellow bishojo anime. obsessed with Yuyu to the point her interactions with other characters feel more like stepping stones to get closer to Yuyu rather than actual supporting characters to help her bring out more personality.That\'s not to say Riri is apathetic, she cares about Yuyu\'s wellbeing, but she\'s just so narrowmindedly naive to the core, she essentially denies herself of any characterization, to the point she\'s just a walking trope of a naive female protagonist (e.g. Yoshika of Strike Witches season 1).her pursuit of her heroine foil.But other than her unnatural Yuyu obsession (which other characters also point out once, but is overshadowed), Riri has no redeeming traits to her naiviety that borders on ego (that is pointed out once in the anime and then ignored after), and like most other naive protagonists, she finds a way to justify her want to help Yuyu even if it means prying into old wounds.Riri\'s initial relationship with the quiet, cynical and brooding Yuyu has her naivety challenged by Yuyu herself, who wants to ""teach"" the naive Riri about how cruel the world really is, but by episode 4, this foreshadowing loses its chance to appear as  Riri is quickly established as the calming Beauty to Yuyu\'s inner revenge-filled Beast, but the buildup to that moment is neither emotionally investing for the viewer, nor is it memorable.This anime would be a great modern day military retelling  of the whole Yuri genre\'s Onee-sama trope if it wasn\'t for the lack of depth in anyone except Yuyu herself, whose personality has turned from kind to cool girl from past trauma,in a Akemi Homura style of events.A weekly TV show needs to be interesting in its first half to have people care about it as much as its director(s) does, but if the director doesn\'t flesh out the characters properly, no one will care what happens to them next week.

As for the story the only thing that I am really intersted in is Yuyu\'s backstory as nothing else really got me invested, the monsters look like a mixture of the franxx and that pokemon magnemite and they aren\'t very ""cool"". None of the characters other than Yuyu really have any depth to them.The music is great and the OP is a Bop!The animation is also really good.And it has very funny moments. My personal favorite line (this far) is “if I were a masochist I’d be over the moon”I recommend Assault Lily Bouqet, it is cute, fun and simple with a tinyyyyyyy bit of depth to ONE (1) character and it has that ""monsters have taken over the world and only teenagers can fight them and those teens only purpose is to fight these monsters and nothing else"" feeling that Darling in the franxx and Evangelion has.7/10 single name.The anime has a shoujo-ai feeling to it and I hope that it actually goes in that direction.

The two main characters get a little bit of development but everyone else is relegated to tropes or basically being a background character in the main cast.I know people love their cute girl shows with hints of (or doused in) Yuri but this doesn't feel like it should even satisfy...that. The characters aren't worth investing your interest in if you can even find some interest. There is basically no development to speak of.It's not like it's even a slice of life, where you are seeing their day to day lives and wacky antics.

The plot moves slowly and the characters are extremely uninteresting and not written very well. It’s a shame this show was a trainwreck because the visuals and ost made it look promising.Assault Lily is a yuri bait anime that is clearly stealing from Madoka .It’s literally so obvious with the personalities of the characters and especially the character designs. Happy pink haired girl with mysterious dark purple haired girl? Nope! Never seen that before….. sarcasm.Ok now lets get on with the review and talk about why this show is a heaping pile of unwatchable garbage.I have...fallen asleep not once, but twice while watching Assault Lily. While the action scenes are animated well. They almost barely last for five minutes. The dramatic scenes last even shorter than the action scenes. Character dies? Five second speech about how they will be remembered and that is pretty much it. Character just has something shocking that happened to them and we weren’t expecting it? Explains it for one minute and showcases it for barely more than a minute and then it doesn’t get brought up again. It’s also like how there are some pretty cool weapons that the characters have but they only use them like once or twice? What the Hell? This show is pretty boring… now lets get on with the characters.So, the main character really has no development or redeeming qualities throughout the entire show. She literally does nothing heroic but she is the hero of the story….? Riri starts off as clumsy and immature and is usually seen getting in the way of many things.  She always gets attacked by a Huge and needs to be saved by one of her friends. Sure, this is normal for a character for like maybe five episodes before they start to develop and change and become more mature but nope Riri stays the same. She literally doesn’t even fight the Huge at the end and all she does is get help.Now onto Yuyu, yikes… of course they had to rip-off Homura and Zero Two and combine them into one character. She starts off as cold and edgy and hates Riri but starts to get used to her and respects her but she doesn’t really care about anyone else..? Yeah, stays the same at the end.The rest of the characters were all just horny for Riri and kept fighting over her. It wasn’t funny at all. Of course there’s typical new girl who gets crowded by a bunch of perverts. But what can I say? Assault Lily is not original and it clearly shows.As for the plot, the premise of young magical girls fighting mysterious beings is so overused. The girls use weapons called charms to fight a mysterious species that came to earth fifty years ago. How did the Huge start? Well…that’s not even explained.. They pretty much just are aliens that show up out of the blue and shit isn’t explained. The biggest flaw was not explaining why all this stuff is happening in the first place.  And of course it’s the akward extroverted girl who meets mysterious aloof girl trope.The music in the show was pretty good, and the ending was one of the best eds I have ever listened to. It really gave off a mystical fantasy feel. The op is also good but not as good as the ed.The animation is good. I was satisfied with the cgi and the action scenes were very smooth.Assault Lily is not very good.

It isn't the best anime I've ever seen, but it's a heck of a lot better than the ratings make it seem!I'll start with the bad. Out of the many characters, only a select few get any kind of development or deep characterization at all. This goes for most shows, however. There is some serious yuri-bait, and while you wish some of the people get together, it's an anime that isn't solely centered around a single relationship so you know it's not going to happen. Some of the story elements are more than a little confusing,...especially towards the end, but any casual viewer should be able to get the gist of most of it. The last thing is that there are definitely some cliche moments, but what else can you really expect from a yuri-bait, sword-gun fighting, monster killing, drama, comedy, action anime?I know I just said a few things I didn't appreciate as much, but those things are FAR outweighed by the good in my opinion. First, the visuals are actually pretty good, I'd say a little above average. The soundtrack is downright awesome, and the op and ed are both really great! The story, while really just an excuse to get some cute girls wielding sword-guns fighting monsters, really lends itself to the characters and interactions it sets up. This show is still mostly just fun, but there are some actually really touching or moving moments. In one scene, I actually felt some tears welling, which was not anything I expected from this anime. ALSO, THESE CHARACTERS DEVELOP!!! And while it's really only the main 2 that have development, the development works really well with the story. Speaking of the story, the first bit is more lighthearted, and it gets slightly more drama heavy towards the second half. That brought down my rating a little, but then the show absolutely killed it towards the end, and even the drama and emotional scenes made the show better! The ending was good too, even if it was a little confusing. And while you can't really tell 100% of the time what is going on during the action scenes, it's just so damn awesome you can't really bring yourself to care about that little stuff.Overall, this was just a hell of a good time. I'm sure all the reviews with low ratings have good reasons for it, but in my opinion this show more than delivers on what it set out to do. especially towards the end, but any casual viewer should be able to get the gist of most of it.

The story keeps nice balance between fights and relations, and is unexpectidally deep. You might think that the only negative thing in the story is the background of one of the girls, but then...(#nospoiler, go see it lol)The art is well-refined and polished, and basically CGI-free. Every edge feels nice and...the anime itself can capture the mood with shapes and colours of the scenes. The design of the weapons and monsets - Huge - isn\'t edgy and is very nice. The Huge might look like robots but then the weapons make even more sense.The sound is perfect. The opening - Sacred worldy by Raise A Sullen - is a banger, and can compete with Tonikawa for the best op of the season. The ending is low-key but really enjoyable aswell. The music is very well-done and it blends in with the scenes perfectly, or it can also make you predict on what is going to happen next.Someone described the characters as ""bland"", but after watching 10 episodes basically every character that the anime uses is well defined and has her own charm (literally).

For many, both production and history need to go together, as one complements the other in order to boast of their effort, bringing pride to the show\'s creators. Even more so when an anime involves action and a combination of scenes that need to coexist with direction, sound and animation. Assault Lily Bouquet ended and it was a very different experience to follow. Not because it is an excellent anime, but it exemplifies and practically answers the question I mentioned above. Who would have thought that such a good proposal would be overlooked...just to make the environment friendly, where the characters\' daily lives are just a slice of life... No, it\'s more than that. The anime is not entirely wasted, it has unusual qualities and works as a pastime, but what makes it so ""average""? What was it really like to watch 12 episodes of functional and impactless fights, while countless characters were shown that, now, everyone who has completed this show must have forgotten the majority? That\'s what I\'m still trying to find out.In order to evaluate this show, it is necessary to differentiate what he had as his goal and what he achieved. Assault Lily is a story where girls with some rare abilities are students at an institution, which at the same time serves as a school and meeting place to annihilate Huges, a type of creature that is controlled by an overwhelming power, Magie, whose sole purpose to attack everything around you. The Lilys, the students, also use Magie in their weapons, known as CHARM, where they fight intense battles with each new invasion on the site. As an idea, the anime made a very good and creative situation that, although not innovative, has a good and interesting system, which entertained me and convinced me to finish the series. The show has charismatic characters and manages to moderate things like comedy, drama and action, even with a text that does not attract public attention. I believe that this happened because the show did not expose a positive relationship between the episodes, as some were totally focused on combat and others did not even have a training or purpose to exist. Something like this happened with Cop Craft, a 2019 anime. In it, the serious and captivating episodes were hampered by a large amount of dialogue that does not please, nor bear fruit for the continuity of the series. Assault Lily had the same fate, for she used moe as a persuasive method to convince herself that she was better than she looked. It is a technique that usually works, but this time it showed the poverty of quality of the series.On the other hand, if we only pay attention to the most important episodes, where only fights matter, it is noticeable that the show is much better than its own totality. The Shaft studio did an excellent job of producing a well-appreciated number of well-directed scenes and managed to give some quality nuances to the audience. This is also due to the characters, because even though it is boring, the show manages to make us care about the protagonists, mainly Riri, Yuyu and Yuri, eventually. Whenever I saw a scene of them being sad or discouraged, I felt a mutual sadness, that is, the anime has a minimal impact load. It is not totally cold or indifferent, nor is it generic in relation to the others. It is possible to have a good enjoyment watching the show, no matter how minor the episodes of development of secondary characters are.And speaking of the girls, they deserve special attention. I confess that I was lost to accompany 9 characters and another 20 (possibly more than that) doing their thing during the show. Above all, the anime set the scene more than it conveyed any emotion. It\'s nice to see the CHARMs being produced, but even more so to accompany some of the characters having some importance in the show, like Kaede and Fumi, they are all adorable. But as the show did not qualify well enough, only the main pair is relevant, which turned out to be a problem, as it was unthinkable to see them defeating huge Huges, simply by power. The anime exposed things like experience and aptitude just to discard them in the most ""dangerous"" moments of the show. Riri grew in posture and changed his habits and this is remarkable is good for the series, but I imagined it would be something gradual and organic, which did not happen. Furthermore, the world politics of this show was contradictory and meaningless, especially when the government ordered it to find Yuri. A civil and internal conflict between the Lilys was expected, but everything was forgotten in the blink of an eye, as if the research, which one of the characters did, was enough to calm a possible war situation.But apart from these conveniences, the show has its apexes, which are the moments when Yuyu lives with an old and irreparable loss, to the point of dueling with herself, being something literally destructive, due to her ability. Her path, which was intended to be gloomy, gradually changed, from her meeting with Riri, to the formation of the Lilys team that her apprentice struggled to achieve. When she breaks free from it, it is delightful to see how one person has changed the life of another. Riri is responsible for this feat. Of course, her skill discovered at the end evidences her entire story in the anime. Her ""charisma"" was important to unite her colleagues, who did not get along well in the beginning, as well as being a strong weapon to save humanity from a terrible threat. The Huges seemed to be a small bomb compared to the potential that the protagonist has (even if that power is for the appealing and exaggerated). It is even possible to say that the show was saved by a pink-haired protagonist, who had nothing but a few friends and was clumsy. Nana (from the anime Munou na Nana) should learn how to be a really nice character to follow.I also highlight the music and animation. They are fluid and made perfectly for this show. The endings are striking and the fights are very expressive. It is worthy of recognition this year, especially with an increasing amount of mediocre adaptations and made with a very low quality. Definitely, this show will be most remembered for these highlights in the designs and the competent OSTs.In the end, Assault Lily Bouquet was an extravagant and new experience for me. His proposal is infinitely better than the show itself, of course, but it still gave me good memories about the reasons that make me attend Japanese shows: creativity and exclusivity. The anime ends with a feeling of ""I want to follow more!"", But unfortunately the show may not have a sequel, as it came from a franchise not much consumed in the West, which is not productive on streaming platforms. And we know how unpopular animes like this need that attention from abroad... But even with the problems of its existence, anime has satisfied me a lot. Although the discrepancy mentioned at the beginning of this review introduces the show, it was sustained in most cases, which is not bad, just a good job from the responsible staff. Congratulations to the Shaft studio, for creating a show with such affection and for making a project different from the others. I will remember this work forever and look forward to new proposals in the future. just to make the environment friendly, where the characters\' daily lives are just a slice of life... No, it\'s more than that. The anime is not entirely wasted, it has unusual qualities and works as a pastime, but what makes it so ""average""? What was it really like to watch 12 episodes of functional and impactless fights, while countless characters were shown that, now, everyone who has completed this show must have forgotten the majority? That\'s what I\'m still trying to find out.In order to evaluate this show, it is necessary to differentiate what he had as his goal and what he achieved. Assault Lily is a story where girls with some rare abilities are students at an institution, which at the same time serves as a school and meeting place to annihilate Huges, a type of creature that is controlled by an overwhelming power, Magie, whose sole purpose to attack everything around you. The Lilys, the students, also use Magie in their weapons, known as CHARM, where they fight intense battles with each new invasion on the site. As an idea, the anime made a very good and creative situation that, although not innovative, has a good and interesting system, which entertained me and convinced me to finish the series. The show has charismatic characters and manages to moderate things like comedy, drama and action, even with a text that does not attract public attention. I believe that this happened because the show did not expose a positive relationship between the episodes, as some were totally focused on combat and others did not even have a training or purpose to exist. Something like this happened with Cop Craft, a 2019 anime. In it, the serious and captivating episodes were hampered by a large amount of dialogue that does not please, nor bear fruit for the continuity of the series. Assault Lily had the same fate, for she used moe as a persuasive method to convince herself that she was better than she looked. It is a technique that usually works, but this time it showed the poverty of quality of the series.On the other hand, if we only pay attention to the most important episodes, where only fights matter, it is noticeable that the show is much better than its own totality.

I really want to give it 10 for the delicacy of thighs throughout this entire anime. Like not only is there a lot of thighs, but they're all so great.I feel overall as an anime, it's worth a 7, pretty average across the board, so I gave it a 7 to fit in with that. but I really would give it a 10 based on the thighs alone.thighs, I swear that's the main plot, nothing had my attention more than the beauty of the thighs in this anime, which is a variety of thigh highs and leggings, and just...thigh in some occasional scenes.I get that all I've really mentioned was thighs this and thighs that, but that is literally the only reason why I wanted to write this review thigh in some occasional scenes.I get that all I've really mentioned was thighs this and thighs that, but that is literally the only reason why I wanted to write this review"", ""I got bored of the show really quickly the plot was actually something that could be interesting but as of so far they haven't done anything with it and the characters were badly written all of them are one dimensional especially the main character shes just so boring and annoying. the art and music were good but not good enough for me to stick with the series.

The 6.46 score is undeserved. I don´t understand why is this rated so low.The story was nice. They constructed a great world with lots of possibilities and ways to carry the story. Animation was great (especially on Yuri fighting the robot) and sound was amazing (banger OP, great four endings, nice insert songs). Characters were also nice and beautiful, with none of them being hateable. Incredible how they got to attack by literally passing a bullet with Guardiola´s or Cappa´s style.

Yeah, give it a try. 7/10Sound: 9/10Character: 7/10Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: 7/10Should you watch it? Yeah, give it a try.', 'I was really looking forward to watching Assault Lily back when I first heard about it last year because the character designs looked great and I thought the concept had potential, even if it wasn\'t the most original idea in the world. However, I was also slightly concerned it would end up being a glorified toy commercial to sell merch, among other things, and unfortunately it turned into pretty much all the things I was worried it would become.First I\'ll start with the things I enjoyed about it, and then I\'ll move onto the more negative aspects that I had problems with.Art and Sound:...The animation is easily the best part about Assault Lily, the animation, character designs, and fight scenes are beautiful, and since the art was what attracted me to this show in the first place, they did pull that off quite well and I have no complaints there. The music is also very good, I loved the OP and EDs, and most of the BGMs are enjoyable, though it\'s not Yuki Kajura or Hiroyuki Sawano levels of quality.Worldbuilding/Lore: The worldbuilding and lore in Assault Lily was mostly what kept me going, there are a lot of fascinating aspects to it with the connections between Lilies and Huge for instance, and I really wanted to learn more about it, but unfortunately much of the worldbuilding potential was squandered in favor of cutesy moe yuribaiting, which I\'ll get to in a moment.Characters: This is where a lot of my issues arise with this show. It has a bloated cast of one-note characters who get little to no development and end up being one-dimensional magical girl tropes. It\'s hard to keep track of and even remember all the characters, which is probably why their names show up on screen every time they appear. The only characters that get any development are Riri and Yuyu, and while I like their relationship, even after 11 episodes I still feel like they haven\'t developed their bond very much, they don\'t share much of their intimate feelings or desires, and they rarely open up to one another. The only semblance of bonding between these two is when Yuyu goes into PMS berserk mode and Riri has to calm her down, but even this feels forced and contrived.Story: The plot is nonexistent, if you asked me what this story was about, I honestly couldn\'t tell you. It feels like it doesn\'t know what it wants to be, and the writers were just putting down whatever popped into their heads, which is mostly boring slice of life stuff that drags on forever. Whenever any interesting tidbits of lore come up, they\'re just vaguely mentioned and then they move right on without really expanding on it at all, which is disappointing because the worldbuilding has so much potential. The pacing is incredibly slow and directionless, like the creators had no idea what story they even wanted to tell, until the last 4 episodes when they pretty much went ""well I guess we gotta come up with some kind of ending."" It puts so much focus on the yuribaiting and slice of life aspects for 80% of the show, then occasionally decides to toss out a few crumbs of ""story"" that take forever to get anywhere. It doesn\'t have to go full on grimdark like Madoka Magica, but I think the balance between the more lighthearted and serious moments could have been handled much better.Fanservice: This aspect is the worst part for me, and it really soured a lot of my enjoyment of the show. Now I love yuri, but what I can\'t stand is yuribait, and this is exactly the latter. We\'ve got all these girls flirting and being cute with each other, but it never goes anywhere because all the characters are bland tropes with no development, and most of the times it comes off as super cheesy and dumb more than anything. Like, they literally put ""yuri"" in the name of the academy, the names of our two main characters (Yuyu and Riri), and even an entire character named Yuri who is portrayed as a ""daughter"" of sorts to Riri and Yuyu. It\'s eye-rolling levels of yuribaiting and it\'s severely offputting to me. I actually do ship Riri and Yuyu because I like their dynamic, but the show does barely anything to develop their relationship and to get them to know each other better. Aside from that we\'ve got tons of bath scenes as well as thighs, and it\'s just...whatever, I guess. It\'s not ecchi levels, but I have a big aversion to fanservice and it\'s honestly disappointing to me that this seems to be the only thing people care about in this show, rather than the story or characters.Overall Thoughts: I\'ve seen a lot of anime over the years (180 to be exact) and I\'ve seen my share of amazing shows, very good shows, decent shows, and plain bad shows. Assault Lily falls into the category of decent shows for me. It\'s not the worst thing I\'ve ever seen, but it\'s far from the best. The animation, character designs, fight scenes, music, and worldbuilding/lore are all great and have potential, but it suffers from a directionless plot, an overstuffed cast of bland characters, and pointless, annoying yuribaiting and fanservice. If they come out with a second season for Assault Lily I probably won\'t watch it, because even with its few good points, that\'s not enough to outweigh its massive narrative problems for me, and once the final episode airs next week and I finish up this show I\'ll be moving on to other things.

Essentially, that is what the show is, and by no means am I suggesting that is a bad thing since as far as the show goes it is a good ride.The art style...used is nice, it is what I would say is a high-grade medium in the regard it is very refined but is starting to be an older format in the regard of not being so polished as to what is available.

What a way to treat myself for christmas and end the year with.I myself, is no expert by all means when writing reviews hence I would like to say that my writing may sway from its main purpose before we get into the review. Moreover, I apologise if you, the reader, finds unsuitable things within this review, should it be spelling and grammar or mistakes and inaccuracy.Assault Lily: Bouquet, the original anime that was made by Shaft that is famously known for their complex stories and their stunning visuals, such as the monogatari series. But this is...nothing about what Shaft did in the past, this is about Assault Lily.We are introduced with Riri, a young girl moving to a military academy and as the defence against Huges, threats of humans. Riri is a very charming girl that everyone loves including me. She quickly made friends with first grades and shared a reasonably deep bond. However, since Riri just started her school, she is the ‘rookie’ character in the first bit. As Riri makes more friends, she encounters Yuyu.Yuyu, known as the lone wolf in the school which is avoided by many other students. Riri, on the other hand, somehow managed to spark a relationship which will deepen in the near future.Riri faces inconveniences with her ability to properly wield CHARMS. With the help of her friends , she eventually managed to wield CHARM. Some may see at this point that this anime will be a ‘Cute girls doing crazy things’ or whatever it’s called but basically it's a bunch of cute anime girls doing super cool and crazy things, which it is BUT not completely.What I enjoyed most from this anime is the characters and their interactions. As new episodes come out, without a doubt that it will contain heart warming wholesomeness interactions. Each and every side character feels like they are someone very important to the story and someone that can be loved. In this case, I really, really liked them all.Every character has their own quirks and abilities, which then helped Riri during her hard times. Their personality also resembles their appearance and is uniquely written by the designers. The uniqueness of each character means that they also have different reasons to fight for which then adds more personality to them.Each bond between Riri and the side characters means something special for me personally. It feels as if they made a deep bond with the audience itself. At dark times, plenty actually, it made me squirm and feel the pain that Riri is experiencing. To see the way when things are dark, you only need a light. The relation that Riri has developed clearly became the light for her path.As for the visuals, it is one of the best. Shaft did it again with this anime with some superb colors, character design, props, etc. This was one of the things that I enjoyed the most from the anime. I truly cannot say anything much since the animation visuals are just straight out stunning that I would even use them for wallpapers. The colors are vibrant and pleasing to the eyes, lines are noticeable but in a good way, background designs are also amazing, and the action scenes were better than average. However, there is some noticeable CGI that is not too pleasing but this only appeared for a few times.For the audio, it’s great. OP and ED are great, no complaints. As for the acting, there may be some improvements, but overall it’s enjoyable and understandable. Moving on with the sound effects, it’s not the best but considerably nice.The directing in this anime is great. The scenes are drawn properly and very pleasing to the eye. The choice of the color pallets really outlined the moving parts and the characters. Not to forget, the fan service of this anime. It is good. Not too much, not too little. Thicc thighs everywhere, but yet it’s imperceptible unless you really look for it.Since I’ve been discussing the good parts, now are the flaws of the anime.It’s cringey. During the ‘tense’ parts of the story or episode, it’s just cringey when the characters interact with each other. Somehow, the way they interact between those parts is just straight unsuitable and a potential mood killer.The pacing overall is unusual. Not that I’m complaining or anything but the first 4-6 episodes were moving slowly as they introduced more characters to the story and more plot explanation. However, some episodes just went super quick. It’s as if a problem starts to resolve too quickly which disappointed me.The people behind this anime seem to like shoving in new faces and forcing the audience to remember them. Personally, I think there are too many side characters that’s being introduced which then left out without proper explanation or background. Same with the main plot of the story, there is just not enough explanation. Sure, I understand about the CHARM and HUGES, but I feel like there need to be more explicit explanations which may help the audience to actually understand to the core.I personally really enjoyed this anime to the point that I’m willing to stand up for it. I can see why some people dislike a ‘female character only,’ but in this case, Assault Lily did a great job to deliver the energy of excitement to me.At first, I was actually sceptical about this anime. Clearly the yuri vibes are there and made me unsure about this. Fortunately, I came to enjoy this anime because of the relationship between Riri and the other girls. It feels as if I can understand Riri’s relationship and bond with her friends. As for the yuri vibes, it’s great yeah! I like the subtle hints and the illustrations at ED.Before this gets too long and me rambling more without a real goal, I’ll conclude my review.Assault Lily: Bouquet, what a great way to end the season, yet it’s still not delivering it’s full potential. At this point, I really appreciate the people behind this since it made me hooked on, but the downsides clearly aren't able to admire and complete the outstanding qualities. nothing about what Shaft did in the past, this is about Assault Lily.We are introduced with Riri, a young girl moving to a military academy and as the defence against Huges, threats of humans.

Riri, on the other hand, somehow managed to spark a relationship which will deepen in the near future.Riri faces inconveniences with her ability to properly wield CHARMS. With the help of her friends , she eventually managed to wield CHARM. Some may see at this point that this anime will be a ‘Cute girls doing crazy things’ or whatever it’s called but basically it's a bunch of cute anime girls doing super cool and crazy things, which it is BUT not completely.What I enjoyed most from this anime is the characters and their interactions. As new episodes come out, without a doubt that it will contain heart warming wholesomeness interactions. Each and every side character feels like they are someone very important to the story and someone that can be loved. In this case, I really, really liked them all.Every character has their own quirks and abilities, which then helped Riri during her hard times. Their personality also resembles their appearance and is uniquely written by the designers. The uniqueness of each character means that they also have different reasons to fight for which then adds more personality to them.Each bond between Riri and the side characters means something special for me personally. It feels as if they made a deep bond with the audience itself. At dark times, plenty actually, it made me squirm and feel the pain that Riri is experiencing. To see the way when things are dark, you only need a light. The relation that Riri has developed clearly became the light for her path.As for the visuals, it is one of the best. Shaft did it again with this anime with some superb colors, character design, props, etc. This was one of the things that I enjoyed the most from the anime. I truly cannot say anything much since the animation visuals are just straight out stunning that I would even use them for wallpapers. The colors are vibrant and pleasing to the eyes, lines are noticeable but in a good way, background designs are also amazing, and the action scenes were better than average. However, there is some noticeable CGI that is not too pleasing but this only appeared for a few times.For the audio, it’s great. OP and ED are great, no complaints. As for the acting, there may be some improvements, but overall it’s enjoyable and understandable. Moving on with the sound effects, it’s not the best but considerably nice.The directing in this anime is great. The scenes are drawn properly and very pleasing to the eye. The choice of the color pallets really outlined the moving parts and the characters. Not to forget, the fan service of this anime. It is good. Not too much, not too little. Thicc thighs everywhere, but yet it’s imperceptible unless you really look for it.Since I’ve been discussing the good parts, now are the flaws of the anime.It’s cringey. During the ‘tense’ parts of the story or episode, it’s just cringey when the characters interact with each other. Somehow, the way they interact between those parts is just straight unsuitable and a potential mood killer.The pacing overall is unusual. Not that I’m complaining or anything but the first 4-6 episodes were moving slowly as they introduced more characters to the story and more plot explanation. However, some episodes just went super quick. It’s as if a problem starts to resolve too quickly which disappointed me.The people behind this anime seem to like shoving in new faces and forcing the audience to remember them. Personally, I think there are too many side characters that’s being introduced which then left out without proper explanation or background. Same with the main plot of the story, there is just not enough explanation. Sure, I understand about the CHARM and HUGES, but I feel like there need to be more explicit explanations which may help the audience to actually understand to the core.I personally really enjoyed this anime to the point that I’m willing to stand up for it. I can see why some people dislike a ‘female character only,’ but in this case, Assault Lily did a great job to deliver the energy of excitement to me.At first, I was actually sceptical about this anime. Clearly the yuri vibes are there and made me unsure about this. Fortunately, I came to enjoy this anime because of the relationship between Riri and the other girls. It feels as if I can understand Riri’s relationship and bond with her friends. As for the yuri vibes, it’s great yeah! I like the subtle hints and the illustrations at ED.Before this gets too long and me rambling more without a real goal, I’ll conclude my review.Assault Lily: Bouquet, what a great way to end the season, yet it’s still not delivering it’s full potential. At this point, I really appreciate the people behind this since it made me hooked on, but the downsides clearly aren't able to admire and complete the outstanding qualities."", 'overall score: -low six- (6.2)First things first The chara design here is really......how should i say it ""eye catching""The story is so-so but the fight scene does show some great animation and quality in it. here you basically have all of your generic essential character like the energetic one, the lazy one, the cute one so-on, so-on. even tho the chara and the plot is nothing special the thing that caught me is the way they serve the show.The way they show from scene to scene and from other perspective to another perspective is just somewhat indifferent for me to see. They didn\'t only focus...on the MC but also focuses on the other character despite having so many of them.ps. yuyu and riri has the best thighs no debate. on the MC but also focuses on the other character despite having so many of them.ps. yuyu and riri has the best thighs no debate.', ""Assault Lily: Bouquet was a really enjoyable show to watch. Nothing masterpiece worthy but it was a really fun ride from beginning to end. As you can read the synopsis of the show from the overview I will only state my opinions of the show based off of the synopsis and what I felt as I watched.Characters/Story: The character designs for all the lilies were quite 'flashy' and i feel many will love these girls designs. I loved all the personalities that the characters showed throughout this series and found myself really engaged in the drama that occurred. The resolutions to those dramas felt...realistic and passionate and is one of the few 12 episode animes this year that I felt had relatively good pacing throughout, only having slight pacing issues around the middle of the series and very last episode. If anything, I think most complaints will come from the fact that maybe ‘too’ much information was being given in the earlier stages of the show regarding the ‘Huge’ and what exactly these girls are (though i personally appreciated the extra dialogue).Animation/Music: The animation and music did not falter throughout this show and was honestly where a huge chunk of my positivity for the show comes from. Additionally, Sacred World (performed by Bang Dream’s RAS) and Edel Lilie are two of my favorite songs of the year and I felt matched this anime perfectly. There really isn’t much negativity I can say in this category.While there were definitely quite a few moments of sadness during this show (one in particular that left me pretty upset during a certain tragic fight against the Huge) it was a satisfying show that I am glad I decided to give a chance to after first hearing about its production at CharaExpo 2019. Definitely give this show a chance! realistic and passionate and is one of the few 12 episode animes this year that I felt had relatively good pacing throughout, only having slight pacing issues around the middle of the series and very last episode.

Definitely give this show a chance!"", '*This review contains spoilers but they are clearly marked*I seemed have a different impression of this series than a lot of people who watched it, and for me, Assault Lily is easily one of the most underrated works of the season. I regularly hear people say things like ""it\'s mostly fanservice, don\'t expect much from the story"" but I disagree. To me, the story is what ultimately carried the series for me and pushed it to be one of my favorites of the season. In fact, because of the backloading of a lot of the central plot elements and the slow-burning build, it\'s a series...that I want to rewatch soon to catch any details I missed. There\'s lots of meat to the lore and room for speculation, and despite the sheer amount of details thrown at the viewer at times, I didn\'t feel like any of it was inconsistent or too hard to follow.That said, I think this series needs to be approached with a certain mindset. While it was marketed mostly as an action series, it\'s more like 50/50 action and slice of life. This is something I haven\'t often found elsewhere and part of what I really like about Assault Lily. And at the core, it is quite different from many of the styles it seems to resemble. While the pacing of the slice of life sections is slower, they are still used to develop the main characters and their relationships which are ultimately central to the plot. So if you go into it expecting a lot of momentum, you\'ll be disappointed until the later episodes (as many people were during broadcast). It\'s worth noting that many former Kyoto Animation staff worked on Assault Lily, which can be felt throughout, and in terms of the tone, this series actually reminded me a lot more of something like Hibike! Euphonium than any magical girl or shounen work.Assault Lily is about the importance of close personal bonds through good and bad, and it does a great job of showing the characters both in their normal everyday lives, and when everything starts to collapse. The cast is quite large and many don\'t get much direct development, but they still have plenty of personality which is showcased passively through more subtle situations. If there\'s a second season I think they\'ll be able to do great things with everything set up so far.Now into the aspect of the story that I loved most. (*SPOILER WARNING FOR THIS PARAGRAPH!*): Riri and Yuyu\'s bond, and Yuyu\'s process in overcoming her fear, grief, and self-hatred after the loss of her former schutzengel. Assault Lily deals with topics such as the ethics of putting the lilies in a situation where they have to put themselves in danger to protect the world, and if their battles are really worth fighting for. This includes the external battle against the HUGE as well as their personal internal battles. And in particular, just because the world is crumbling outside doesn\'t mean one\'s personal issues just go away, and sometimes they coincide at the worst possible times. The culmination of this is some of Shaft\'s signature surrealism that isn\'t present in most of the rest of the series, used to great effect, in a finale that gave me chills. And this wouldn\'t have nearly the effect it does if not for the slower pacing taken earlier on to give a stark contrast. The way the story is handled also seems to take cues from some surprising places. A couple of my favorite moments become heavily surreal and metaphorical in a way which reminds me a lot of Ikuhara\'s work, of all things, in a way that feels deep and heartfelt.Something else which needs mentioning is the art and music. Both are top notch and deeply atmospheric. The art tends to be less experimental than much of what Shaft is known for, though it still has nods to their ""signature"" such as a head tilt here and there and some nice sakuga. I also mentioned briefly that former KyoAni staff worked on this, and this is especially apparent in the art. The soundtrack was composed by Matsuda Akito who composed for Hibike! Euphonium, and the music perfectly accents every change in tone. I\'d say even for those who won\'t get into the story, Assault Lily is still an enjoyable watch for this aspect.In terms of shortcomings, the biggest one for me is the large cast which ideally would\'ve gotten some more individual development. Also, there is quite a bit of fanservice and while it\'s not as overt as some series, it can still be a bit on the excessive side for my taste.TL;DR: Assault Lily is a must-see for those who love both Kyoto Animation and Shaft. Otherwise, it\'s nice if you want a balance of slice of life and action, or if you want something cozy and mostly easy to watch. I recommend going into it without any particular expectations. that I want to rewatch soon to catch any details I missed.

It\'s already a mess as you can tell. An enjoyable one for sure, but there\'s no clear direction at all.It\'s set in a slightly advanced postapocalyptic world based on magic, with a single military school in focus. There\'s a lot of untold history here, but we\'re only getting snippets of the backstory. ""there are magical enemies called huge, there are girls who fight them called yuris and this is the school they\'re going to."" simple right? I\'d say...the synopsys tell you more than the show itself about the setting. Information given is very sporadic and sacre.There\'s politics involved, but only surface level at best.""the school exists, the girls are considered weapons, and a lot of people don\'t like it"" it will honestly feel unnecessary.There\'s yuribait fanservice. if you\'re looking for real yuri moments and shipping you\'ll be disappointed, be warned. Farnservice mostly exists as thigh shots only.There\'s slice of life, which will drive you up the wall if you\'re here for anything else. But for a SoL show, it has way too much depression, action and story.As you know, SoL shows live or die by the characters. There\'s a very good reason most shows have only 4 characters. instead of... 18 listed, but I know there\'s more of them.Every character is bland, and most exist for comedy or as throwaways.  This includes the two main characters, the silent angsty one with a past, and the happy go lucky generic moe one.It\'s not a bad combo, but there isn\'t much interaction between them.The show tries to show us emotional moments, the stress and sadness involved in fighting, which are almost immediately dismissed. ""yeah it\'s there. next scene.""There are also cool action scenes with a few glimpses of sakuga, which I imagined would be the focus, looking at the toyline with transforming weapons.At this point I\'d like to say that the art and animation is really inconsistent. You can find amazing shots straight out of Hibike! Euphonium, while the next scene will be akin to Hinako Note.You\'ll find cgi fights (they\'re not as jarring as usual), and amazing animation both. it never looks bad, but it never looks consistent so the change between the scenes are always sudden and jarring.To sum it up: there\'s worldbuilding, sol, action, fanservice, politics, and drama. What isn\'t there is balance. The show can\'t keep it\'s focus for 5 damn minutes, and it tries to deal with so many things at once it\'s impossible to work with. On top of that, it seems to always prefer the least interesting topics. Dealing with something serious, that could lead to character growth you say? NAH, let\'s go somewhere to search for a random thingy instead. god save us from a few interesting moments, the audience might end up sympathizing with someone, or worse.I expected better from a former Gainax employee, director san.Final thoughts: there\'s potential here, but a show is more than just the sum of it\'s parts. Assault Lily is simply not coherent enough, it has all the elements to make something enjoyable and interesting, but no glue to stick it together. While all of these seem negative, I still enjoyed the show somewhat, the setting and the fight scenes are nice. Unfortunately this is more than I can say for most seasonals, which makes this show above average in my book. I would never recommend it, but it\'s not awful by any means.

The main characters all get their share of screen time, and their personalities are shown to be unique and are expanded upon in Assault Lily: Fruits.

I would like to see a slightly longer version that has a slower story progression, but beggars can't be choosers!Overall, not much is to be expected as the anime is almost an 'advertisement' for the game that came along with it.

So, after watching this show twice, once in Japanese and the other in English, was Assault Lily any good.StoryThe premise of teenage girls fighting a supernatural threat is pretty commonplace is anime, but Assault Lily puts an interesting spin on it by giving special focus on their weapons, their Charms. The girls, known as Lilies, use their Charms in order to fight giant monsters called Huge in epic battles throughout the landscape, while at...the same time, they try to navigate through the pressures of what it means to be a Lily. The show doesn't shy away from depicting teenage girls as wiser and smarter beyond their years, such as talking politics and science or behaving like soldiers. That said, it doesn't become overly dark and gritty and still manages to maintain a stable balance between cute girls doing cute girls and intense action that wouldn't look out of place in a shonen anime. (7/10)CharactersThe protagonist, Riri, is basically required to be an everygirl, the character viewers are supposed to relate to the most or the easiest. She experiences much of the Assault Lily universe for the first time and ends up asking the questions we ourselves would ask if we found ourselves in those exact same situations. Riri is unexpectedly paired up with the seasoned veteran Yuyu, and their relationship quickly become the most interesting aspect of the show.Riri and Yuyu evolve through their interactions with each other and by the show's end, it's become obvious that the two ultimately bring out the best in each other. I also enjoyed the supporting cast, such as the shy Fumi, the proud and elegant Kaede, the quirky and cheerful Miriam and the genius scientist Moyu. The character writing is easily one of the best aspects in Assault Lily.

(8/10)"", 'All female anime is something i typically stay away from because they\'re either not aimed at a male audience, or they are and usually rely on conspicuous amounts of service to provide entertainment (which i don\'t personally find all that stimulating).AL:B kinda falls in the middle, but does so in a surprisingly tasteful manner. The characters don\'t exist simply to satisfy male fantasies (though they are designed in such a way to be overtly ""kawaii"", there is a maturity/sensibility to it) and they each have their own distinct personalities with their own individual past, goals/ambitions, etc. The story as a whole isn\'t exactly deep, the...show just kinda runs with a lot of assumptions about the universe, not worrying too much about minor details. Which in itself is neither here nor there as a criticism, but does mean that the ambiguous amorphous alien antagonist we see in a lot of low tier shows of this kind leave a lot to the imagination as the show goes on around it/them. Since these antagonist(s) are largely cheap and thoughtless that does remove a whole dimension of the show as an untapped resource to draw people in.That being said, the show does have decent focus elsewhere. With decent character development from/between the protagonists even if it all seems by the numbers (suffering certain character tropes rather than to make them unique individuals) I feel like that\'s largely intended since half of the stimulus provided from the show is in fact the appealing aesthetic. My take is that the show is implicitly intended to be easy, thoughtless watching.So i feel like it can be summarised as such: cute, simple, easy, aesthetic. The friendship scenes can be corny, but that comes with the territory and the combat scenes are actually really well done and cool. It\'s just a well balanced show that doesn\'t do particularly poorly or well at anything except for having amazing art. It\'s by no means top tier, but definitely better than average and was surprisingly to my taste. show just kinda runs with a lot of assumptions about the universe, not worrying too much about minor details. Which in itself is neither here nor there as a criticism, but does mean that the ambiguous amorphous alien antagonist we see in a lot of low tier shows of this kind leave a lot to the imagination as the show goes on around it/them. Since these antagonist(s) are largely cheap and thoughtless that does remove a whole dimension of the show as an untapped resource to draw people in.That being said, the show does have decent focus elsewhere. With decent character development from/between the protagonists even if it all seems by the numbers (suffering certain character tropes rather than to make them unique individuals) I feel like that\'s largely intended since half of the stimulus provided from the show is in fact the appealing aesthetic. My take is that the show is implicitly intended to be easy, thoughtless watching.So i feel like it can be summarised as such: cute, simple, easy, aesthetic. The friendship scenes can be corny, but that comes with the territory and the combat scenes are actually really well done and cool.

That\'s like the lowest bar you can set.Numerous archetypes show up in the show, all without much personality or development. You have your typical main character, whose only strength is her courage that doesn\'t match her...actual battle prowess. Of course, she manages to always make it out basically unscathed after going into battle with reckless abandon, as the plot armor has blessed her. You then have the ""cool"" girl, that\'s strong, but closed her heart due to a tragic past, who our main character is trying to be friends with. Sound familiar? There\'s a whole lot of side characters that don\'t catch my interest whatsoever, all absolutely soulless with no development whatsoever.Madoka was creative in it\'s story, from beginning to end. This show is more of a CGDCT yuri anime that\'s trying to latch on to the success of Madoka by presenting fanservice in order to compensate for meaningful story and characters.There\'s just too many characters to establish any semblance of good character interaction and development. Madoka had around 4 characters. This show, has like 20. I liked Madoka because each character was explored to the fullest. This show obviously scratches the surface on everyone except Riri and Yuyu, the two main characters of the show. By episode 2, there\'s already terribles introduced: the annoying character that\'s in love with Riri for some dumb reason, a timid but perverted girl, etc.Of course, the setting is set in a school. Never seen that one before. Plus, I just love how the pilot episode has a forced development like Riri pairing up with Yuyu to kill a monster that should have been taken up by actual staff or upperclassmen.

Assault Lily : Bouquet has nothing too deep or emotionally intense to offer; it isn't original either, but it's very well executed. If you want something fun to watch with a fast pace, nice battles and cute yuri, please yourself.The musics (opening and ending) are actually fantastic. The art is of superior quality. The yuri is pleasant and explicit, nothing serious, but nothing vulgar either. The story and writing are nothing memorable, neither the characters are, but they are still good company for a season.The general rating is way too stiff in my opinion.

Akiba's Trip The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34051/Akibas_Trip_The_Animation,"['Ah, Akihabara. Otaku center of the world. Filled to the brim with anime, manga, video games, computer goods, maid cafés, and vampires.Akiba\'s Trip The Animation feels like a love letter to Akiba and every nerdy interest you can think of. Is it a masterful work of writing? No. Is it thought provoking? No. Is it enjoyable? I\'d like to think so. Isn\'t that why we watch anime? To enjoy ourselves?The premise is quite simple. Akiba has been overrun by vampires known as ""Bugged Ones"" and the only way to defeat them is to strip them of their clothes and expose them to sunlight. Depending...on your tolerance for fan service there\'s your indication as to whether or not you should bother starting the show. However, for those coming in because they\'re thinking the show will have the same amount of fan service as Prison School for example, you\'ll be disappointed as the fan service is quite minimal considering the premise of the show.The show\'s strongest asset in my eyes is how much heart it feels went into the show. As previously mentioned the show is a love letter to Akiba and every nerdy interest you can think of. Computers, card games, audiophiles, Street Fighter, wrestling, and more. Every episode is an affectionate parody of these subcultures and is both the show\'s biggest strength and weakness. If you\'re familiar with what they happen to be parodying that episode you will enjoy yourself immensely, but if not, you might feel like you\'re being left out of the joke. This results in each episode being quite hit or miss. Not every episode will be a hit, but when they are, my God do they hit.This love and passion for these interests leads to a payoff when it comes to the show\'s comedy. The accuracy of the wrestling tropes. A person\'s descent into becoming an audiophile. How a card game looks for people who know what\'s going on vs people who don\'t know a thing about the game. They know what will make people who enjoy these interests laugh and they make good use of that knowledge. The show knows how stupid it is and revels in by going completely over the top whenever possible. It\'s not afraid to poke fun at itself either by occasionally referencing various characteristics of the show itself. It\'s all comedic gold.The characters aren\'t particularly complex and developed, but would you expect anything different? That\'s not to say they’re walking tropes however. Tamotsu escapes being a bland nerd MC and Arisa shows off her loyalty when faced with an important decision. It\'s not much, but it\'s something. But frankly in a show like this the development and complexity of the characters isn\'t important. What is important however is how likable they are. The group is full of energy and enthusiasm when the times are good, and when push comes to shove they\'ll go out of their way to show how much they care about each other.Could I talk about the art or the sound? Sure, probably. But frankly they\'re not remarkably good or bad enough to justifying writing about and I don\'t see a point in telling you something is completely average just for the sake of padding out the amount of words in this review.For me Akiba\'s Trip has been the surprise of the season and was a complete joy to watch. The show knew what it wanted to achieve and passed with flying colours. It\'s goofy, it\'s fun, it\'s energetic, it\'s hilarious, it\'s Akiba\'s Trip. on your tolerance for fan service there\'s your indication as to whether or not you should bother starting the show.

It\'s goofy, it\'s fun, it\'s energetic, it\'s hilarious, it\'s Akiba\'s Trip.', 'The beautiful thing about comedy is that it\'s subjective.  It\'s an extremely wide topic where there\'re a multitude of ways to go about it, with the main goal being getting those watching or listening to laugh at the end.  So, how does one go about making the ridiculous plot of stripping off peoples\' clothes entertaining?  Well, by shoving in references of course.Story: Akihabara, the place of hopes and dreams is threatened by an unseen threat.  Bugged ones, creatures who lurk in the dark, seek to take over the otaku capital and rule over it by their own laws and values....In order to beat them, one must expose the people they inhabit to light.  Which means, strip the person to their undergarments.  But never fear, the team consisting of three teenagers and a middle schooler known as Electric Mayonnaise is here!  Oh god, we\'re still screwed aren\'t we?Based on a game series with the same name, Akiba\'s Trip The Animation takes the gameplay elements of fighting the enemies by stripping them in the Akihabara setting and nothing else.  The entire series is made with completely new characters and features a storyline entirely of one-off episodic adventures that each feature a theme pertaining to either one part of Otaku culture with varying degrees of comedic success.  Each episode acts like its own zany and wacky adventure where the characters always end up fighting a Bugged One as the episode\'s ""Final Boss"" before returning back to their normal lives and back to the status quo of the series.Comedy comes in the form of exaggeration and quickly timed jokes that snap in and out as fast as they come.  Due to the show\'s fast-paced nature, the show never sits on one joke for too long, and keeps going along with the series\'s momentum to make sure keep the audience engaged to the end.  Though the jokes can be hit or miss both depending on what you\'re a fan of (since they cover quite a wide variety of topics), and due to how blunt and not subtle everything is, the show is very consistent on how it wants to do things and doesn\'t falter on what it wants to deliver.And that\'s...all there is.  Packed full of references (both real world and from other series\'), Akiba\'s Trip The Animation is quite simply a sporadic episodic story that uses the exact same storyline for each episode with the only variation being how the story is set up, what each episode\'s theme is, and what kind of boss they\'re fighting in the end.  There honestly isn\'t much to say.Overview:+/- Episodic storyline (depends on your taste)+/- Blunt, fast-paced comedy (depends on your taste)Characters: Development is very slim for the characters in Akiba\'s Strip, as the fast-paced comedic nature of the series makes it very difficult for any meaningful development to happen to any of its characters.Electric Mayonnaise, the titular group of the series, consists of 3 (technically 5?) members.  Mayonaka Matome is a Bugged One who fights to save Akihabara from those that want to take the district for themselves, Tamotsu Denkigai is an otaku turned Bugged One who\'s more than happy to defend Akihabara and save it from potential doom, and Ahokainen Arisa is a blonde foreigner who\'s basically a Mary Sue, capable of doing...almost everything (somehow) while cosplaying at every chance she has.  In short, what you see is what you get, as their characters barely change throughout the entire series.  If anything, you get to learn more about their personalities and what they\'ve done, but beyond that, there\'s nothing much to say.  The other two characters that are technically part of Electric Mayonnaise are Denkigai Niwaka, Tamotsu\'s little sister, and the professor, who\'s this tiny girl with a large labcoat on a segeway.  Likewise, what you see is what you get, and like the main trio, are characters that barely change in the series.The Bugged Ones that act as villains in the series are quite simple.  They all want to take over Akihabara in some strange yet convoluted manner.  They act more like the episode\'s final boss that our main characters must fight at the episode\'s climax more than anything, and have very little beyond their characters beyond their motivation to rule Akiba.There\'re quite a number of side characters in this show, spanning shokeepers in Akiba, to random characters that get featured in the series once or twice that all add one or two things to the series, culminating to the spastic feel that is this show.  They\'re not really all that important, but they help spice what\'s already there.Overview:+ Defined, entertaining characters-  Entire cast is one noteArt: Produced by Gonzo, Akiba\'s Trip boasts a colorful, erratic, and wild artsyle that further compliments the comedy of the series.  Everything from the characters\' movements to the the backgrounds and settings is done in a distracting yet entertaining way that compliments the fast paced nature of the series.  Though the show isn\'t always consistent in this manner.  The background audience for a large majority of the scenes are white figures with smiley faces rather than handdrawn characters, so in this regard, while it fits to the outlandish nature that this show boasts, has hit or miss qualities.Fanservice is actually quite common in this show, which isn\'t very surprising when the show is about stripping people naked to save a district in Japan.  Though they\'re blatant with it, fanservice doesn\'t actually come all that often, and when it\'s done, it\'s not so overglorified that it detracts from the show, though that does happen on occasion.What I think where the art really exceeds expectations is in some of the real life references that they were able to execute in this show.  First off, they got real life sponsors to make cameos.  Not only that, but in one episode, they were able to get real footage from Street Fighter V of all things in their show.  Now these might not be too difficult to obtain, but the fact that the show was able to get some stuff from real life into the show was in my eyes, pretty cool, especially since most anime that do something like this make their own parody versions to avoid copyright and other legal problems.Overview:+ Colorful and crazy art to fit the show+ They legit got Capcom to let them use Street Fighter footage in an episode-  Laziness in some aspects of the artSound: As far as sound goes, Akiba\'s Trip\'s OP has a high energy beat reflective of that to the series it comes from.  Complete with idol singing and a clear fast beat, the OP is, while isn\'t all that memorable when not put on repeat, is a nice, fast song to listen to.  EDs in Akiba\'s Trip vary, as roughly each episode has its own ED with the main draw of all of them being the fact that they\'re all idol songs.  Similarly, not as memorable as they could be, but still nice listens.Personal Enjoyment: If you ask me, I\'ll tell you that Akiba\'s Trip is a stupid, pointless show that has no value aside from being brainless entertainment.  And that\'s precisely why I love it.  The show to an extent is self-aware of its own merits and it owns up to them, enhancing its dumb and energetic self to create a fun to watch show that despite not being serious in the slightest, can still be enjoyable.  I liked it, and more important than anything, I enjoyed and had fun with it.Did I like this anime?Oh far too much.  The fact that the show was self-aware of its own stupidity made it that much easier to enjoy its random episodes.  In particular, the episode where they talk about card games (I think it was episode 8) was the episode that resonated with me the most.  Not only that, but I like Mayonaka as a character.What didn\'t I like about this anime?Honestly, there wasn\'t really much to hate for me.  I wouldn\'t call this one of my favorite series, but I had so much fun watching this show that I really had no reason to dislike it at all for any reason.Would I recommend this anime?If you\'re into stupid, brainless, and sporadic comedy shows like me, then Akiba Strip is a pretty good pick.  Its episodic nature and completely non-serious demeanor makes this show a fun venture to watch.  Though same with all comedy, it is subjective to a specific audience, so if you\'re not a fan of in your face humor, then this is probably not the show for you. In order to beat them, one must expose the people they inhabit to light.  Which means, strip the person to their undergarments.

The fact that the show was self-aware of its own stupidity made it that much easier to enjoy its random episodes.  In particular, the episode where they talk about card games (I think it was episode 8) was the episode that resonated with me the most.  Not only that, but I like Mayonaka as a character.What didn\'t I like about this anime?Honestly, there wasn\'t really much to hate for me.  I wouldn\'t call this one of my favorite series, but I had so much fun watching this show that I really had no reason to dislike it at all for any reason.Would I recommend this anime?If you\'re into stupid, brainless, and sporadic comedy shows like me, then Akiba Strip is a pretty good pick.  Its episodic nature and completely non-serious demeanor makes this show a fun venture to watch.  Though same with all comedy, it is subjective to a specific audience, so if you\'re not a fan of in your face humor, then this is probably not the show for you.', '[This is my first review, so if you see grammar mistakes or typos, please bear with me]Akiba\'s Trip is an anime based of a game about stripping. I don\'t know about the game tho, but the anime is good enough to make me kept watching \'til the end. It\'s a bit early for me to review this (since there\'s only 4 episodes out at the time I\'m writing this) but since another users have reviewed this, yea.Story: 5/10Very dumb. In Akiba, there\'s something called Bugged Ones who possess people living around there to make them evil. To make them back to their ""previous"" side, the...main heroes Tamotsu (not Mokkun from Boku no Pico, lol) and the red-haired girl should undress them. Then Tamotsu got interested for something like idols (ep 3) and radios (ep 4). He even managed to buy everything related to it, with a really high price. Because of his interest, he got to met some Bugged Ones. (like in the pool of ep 3)Pretty dumb, right? Since almost every Bugged Ones are girl, you know what\'s going to happen.Art: 8/10I really liked the colors and the character design. The animation is ok, it goes well with the budget.Sound: 4/10The OP, ED, and the OST were forgettable. I can\'t even remember a single bit of the OP. The voice acting is nice tho.Character: 5/10Forgettable cast. I only remember Tamotsu because his name sounds like Mokkun from BnP, the rest were forgettable. There is a fanservice generator (the yellow-haired girl), Tamotsu\'s sister, and a red-haired girl who managed to kiss Tamotsu. Also, a professor with a really long name. After writing that, I realized that\'s a pretty generic cast.Enjoyment: 8/10Because I don\'t mind the ecchi part, I really enjoyed this. For those who hate ecchi, you wouldn\'t enjoyed this to it\'s maximum.Overall: 6/10Pass if you hate fanservice/ecchi, watch if you dont care and need your daily dose of another ecchi comedy. main heroes Tamotsu (not Mokkun from Boku no Pico, lol) and the red-haired girl should undress them.

There is some fanservice here and there and it can be quite nice but this show does not live and die off of fanservice. It actually lives and breathes off of comedy. And it is really good at it.The comedy of Akiba's Trip is specialized and really out there. They don't settle with just making a job plain they really go all the way out there and really proclaim it. The fiendish plans range from silly but plausible to WTF HOW...DO YOU THINK THIS WOULD WORK!? And it works because each plan is more stupid than the last until it gets to the point of just HOWWW. Everything is exaggerated in this show. The farther into each episode the more exaggerated it gets. It's great to see all the twists and turns that they throw in. Not only do they throw in great exaggerations but they also model it to fit into the realm of okatuness that they are covering for the episode. This acts as a celebration of okatu culture which is a novel idea. Furthermore, it does so in unique and fun ways only adding to the joy of each episode.Aiding the comedy is a great cast of characters. Each one of them feels refreshing and interesting in their own rights. Tomatsu is not the typical self-insert bland MC. He's super dedicated to one thing at a time, and with push himself to do the best at that one task, showing an unusual amount of drive. He's also a complete hipster. His cell phone looks dated. He's always looking up alternative methods to do the okatu habits that he enjoys rather than sticking to the tried and true. This makes him that much more interesting as a character.His little sister Niwaka is also great. It's clear that she loves Tomatsu as a sibling but it never goes beyond that. She wants him but she doesn't cling to him, nor is what she does defined by him. She also hangs out more with the other girls that surround Tomatsu as well. Even if she has some of the imouto traits, she's refreshing as she's honest and doesn't define herself only by her onii-chan, rather she feels like a real sister who does care for her brother. (She's also not annoying and she doesn't try to push him into things, she's a pretty cool person.)Mayo and Arisa are also both great characters. They all have likeable charm to them even though Mayo does stay in the tsundere character. (Although she does grow warmer over the span of the show.) Overall the characters all have their own likeable charms while still sticking to a general role. While they aren't the most developed they are refreshing and fun and thusly enjoyable.I'd argue the plot is pretty cool too. The general plot leaves open a hype ending as well as provides the context for the fun of the episodic nature of the show. The comedy is enhanced by the episodic nature because they can keep on making things more extreme which each episode, using the same formula and providing twists to keep it fun. All it all it creates a nice structure for the show to work with, which helps its success.It also happens to have some nice sorta unexpected development which I quite enjoyed.The animation I feel like it pretty strong and the art can be quite humorous. Some of the character designs are really well done while others are quite funny in their simplicity. It's enjoyable to see the wide range of character designs they have from cool to cute, to silly simple. The music is also pretty good too. I wouldn't call the OST great but there are some nice memorable tracks which help the show out.All and all it's a great show with the ability to provide refreshing characters, a nice plot and development and most importantly a lot of good comedy. And it provides all of this while also giving a supporting message to Okatu culture. A message that we shouldn't judge others for what we do because we're all working off our passion and that's great. I'd recommend it if you'd like a fun and silly show. It's quite a good one.

Here are my thoughts:The plot is mostly episodic monster-of-the-week stuff that is consistently boring and idiotic. Basically, there are bad guys in Akibahara, and the only way to fight them is to strip off their clothes (hence the title of the show). It's as moronic as it sounds, and it stops being funny after about 5 minutes, yet entire scenes are devoted to it, usually multiple times per episode. The fight scenes are boring as hell and drag on way too long. This show overall is frankly just completely retarded, and not in an endearing way either, at least not enough...for 13 episodes. My average level of enjoyment while watching was quite low, but every so often there'd be some relatable nerd reference that I'd chuckle at, which is why I didn't drop it.The art style is somewhat cartoonish and has a strongly saturated colour palette. The animation is simplistic with quality adequate at best. It feels pretty low budget overall. The character designs are also cartoonish; I don't like them aesthetically, but they do kinda fit the theme of the show. Their simplicity made them easy to animate as well, which I guess was beneficial for the action scenes. The characters' personalities are generic and simplistic, as well as annoying in some cases.As for audio, the OP song is pretty good and has nice peppy vocals. However, the cartoonish OST itself sounds low budget and is sometimes abrasive. The voice acting is also consistently awful. In fact multiple voices in the cast made me want to shove toothpicks into my ears they were so annoying.Akiba's Trip has quite an authentic otaku-culture theme. The only reason I stuck with this anime was for the truly genuine otaku-culture flavour. Literally nothing else about it was entertaining. These otaku-culture references are diverse too; for example, there are allusions to milsim hobbies, audiophile culture, idol fandom, amateur radio, and PC building. They even have a Yugioh/MTG parody episode, which contains some hilarious moments. I also got the feeling there were obscure references to Japanese Akiba-related pop culture that I probably didn't fully catch.Aside from the authentic cultural flavour, this show is seriously awful. The only reason you should consider watching it is if a strong otaku-culture theme appeals to you. Even then, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this. What I'm writing here may sound appealing, but I really can't overstate how underwhelming this show is in reality. Also, the last couple episodes are filled with groan-inducing forced drama that was painful to sit through.My overall rating: 3/10This anime is exasperatingly retarded and often boring as hell (especially the fight scenes). However, it does have an authentic otaku-culture flavour and relatable nerdy references. Akiba's Trip feels like a passion project done poorly.Seriously, this show is total brainrot material and to be honest I was only able to tolerate it whilst stoned out of my mind.Lastly, apparently there is a game related to this – for the record, I have never played it. for 13 episodes.

I liked the colors even just on the picture representing the anime.  Actually I think the art is the best thing about this anime.The second is that the premise seemed light and funny despite its ecchi-ness.  I don't respect fanservice... and naturally the less of it an anime has, the more I respect that anime.  Despite that, it doesn't turn me off to a show.  I tolerate it and even sometimes enjoy it... like we all do.  (There's two kinds of...people who watch anime: people who occasionally enjoy fanservice and liars).  [That's a half joke.  Don't get all triggered on me].ANYWAYSThis anime did something to me that I hate: A tonal shift immediately after the first episode.I went into this anime with pretty much 0 expectations, thinking it to be a simple, silly, goofy anime that I could stop watching when I picked my next 'good' anime to watch.  The first episode however, despite the comedy, was fairly dark.  Combat was well animated (I think.  Sometimes less is more if you ask me.)  And there was more blood than I expected.  Also more intimacy than I expected with, actually, a fairly decent meeting of lips as far as anime goes.  Even the fanservice had some plot significance.  It all came together and made me interested to see where the story went.And then they did nothing with it.  The story has not progressed in 8 episodes, and after teasing me with the tone of the first episode, it immediately became the silly goofy worthless kind of anime that I had expected it to be, each episode becoming harder to get through.  And yes, I binged the 8 episodes (out at the time of this review) in 2 nights, hoping that the tone of the first episode was foreshadowing a darker second half.  Now, seeing as I can't seem to find an intended episode count anywhere I suppose it could be longer... but my guess is that they're going for a 10-12 episode anime, which we are quite passed the halfway point of.  That makes me sad.I did know, however, that my hope for a dark twist was probably in vain.  As much as the first episode had good interesting 'darker' moments, there was a lot of silliness there too.

Would you ever want to feel like that again? If the answer is yes, then here you go, this is it but with boobs, asses and even DICKS!*Disclaimer: Don\'t expect to see any of that though, it\'s all censored of course.The concept like that has been seen before of course, this is not anything new, but mix that with the intent of showcasing any type of phase that exists in the world and you may just find a winner for some of us in the anime community. With that being said, I...present you with Akiba\'s Trip The Animation, based on the somewhat popular series of games, this is probably the most explosive and bombastic anime of Winter 2017.The whole idea of Akiba\'s Trip is not one that I would call simple. Tamotsu and his sister Niwaka go to Akihabara, which just like in our world is a place full of otaku merchandise, anime, manga, maid cafes and such. In one of the shops with exclusive goods he meets Arisa, a busty girl from Finland and they quickly bond over figurines. Later he also runs into Mayonaka who is a part of defense group that protects the place from incidents, but it turns out there\'s more to it. Monsters invade Akiba and as Tamotsu rushes to save his sister he gets tangled up in the war between the two groups. He receives special powers that end up trapping him. Without much choice he becomes the protector Akiba deserved and desperately needed.Some of you may see this as a generic plot, but you forgot one part of it all- the title. Sure, you could just read it as a trip to Akiba, but if you could just take that s and put it next to the second word, you\'ll understand that this anime is going to offer more than just the plot. It\'s gonna offer all the ""plots"", if you know what I\'m saying *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*Ekhm... sorry about that.The way that the Bugged Ones - the previously mentioned monsters that disguise themselves as humans - are defeated, is by stripping them down completely. You can expect a lot of character fanservice in here, all damage is done through ripping off clothes so that\'s kinda obvious, but I feel like it\'s a very important part of all the craziness that it tries to portray.Speaking of the craziness, the most important part of it is the format of the show. It\'s like an episodic ""adventure"" type of a show with the last couple of episodes trying to create an ending for a season. It\'s something that I immediately connect with the cartoons that I watched when I was younger, kinda like Teen Titans or Ben 10. Putting this into an anime isn\'t anything new, far from it. It\'s been used a lot, but not in the way that those previously mentioned shows do. Akiba\'s Trip embraces itself entirely. It knows it\'s a trashy show and it should only concentrate on fun, possibly leaving some space for an arc at the end of it. I wouldn\'t say it\'s a justification of how the show lacks serious progression through over half of its runtime or how every story has to end in one episodes, it\'s just my way of experiencing the show and seeing it for what it is rather than as something it clearly never aimed for. This show doesn\'t try to be serious, even if may seem like it does, it always plays it for the laughs in the end. It\'s self-aware, knows who it panders to, often touches on the topic of who are otakus and knows its limits. I really appreciate how this series handles the topics of unity and the otaku culture. It\'s actually beautiful. Still, this leaves the viewer with the question: Is that enough?Now the answer will depend on the content of the episodes, so let\'s talk about that. As I mentioned, Akiba\'s Trip indulges itself in its trashiness. It makes the best decision it possibly could have made: it creates episodes for all the nerds out there.You watch wrestling? There\'s an episode about wrestling.You watch gaming tournaments? There\'s an episode about a gaming tournament.You watch porn? There\'s an episode about porn.Yes, I\'m serious.While the first episode is only a poor exposition, because it gives the impression of it being just an ecchi show, everything past that is pure madness. It doesn\'t have only one thing it uses, it has multiple ones that it completely overblows. And that\'s fun! Yes, it\'s the same formula over and over, the team meets someone who later turns out to be a Bugged One that they defeat by stripping him/her, but it manages to keep it fresh. You may think that its episodic nature will ruin the feeling of continuity or that the lack of connection could just turn it into a boring show that only has cool moments. Worry not, the cast is here to help.The characters are just as ridiculous and fickle as the plot. Tamotsu jumps from being a hipster to being a normie to being a mainstream fag at any convenient point. It\'s not because he is written poorly, but because he lives in freaking Akiba. You can find everything there, and so he tries all of it out one by one. You can say that he has an attention span of a dog. He\'s honestly a great main character for the series, easily relatable and constantly changing to be compatible with the current topic. Haven\'t you ever went through a phase in your life? That chunk of your precious time that you spent on only one type of entertainment over a certain period of your existence, like wrestling, gaming and such. Tamotsu is the embodiment of that, it\'s just because of the situation he found himself in, he changes his interests more often.The only character that could come close to  Tamotsu in terms of sudden changing is Arisa Ahokainen. She traveled all over the world and experienced many different things, but decided to roll with the squad in Akiba. This busty blonde from Finland is more of a companion than anything else, but she does have several unique features. She cosplays at all times, changing her clothes multiple times throughout an episode, her voice is very high pitched and her energy is endless.The other two group members are Mayonaka, who\'s just a tomboy with a baseball bat, and Niwaka, who ends up being a damsel in distress a bit too much. There\'s seriously not much to say about them, though their characters do progress and become more likable as time goes on.The main cast works really well off of each other, for example Tamotsu\'s and Arisa\'s clumsiness contrasts with Mayo\'s sense of duty. It\'s used in a pretty simple way: When a specific reaction seems to be the best one, the characters that can pull that expression off step up to the spotlight. It works rather well and gives off a feeling of good character rotation and solid comedic timing.The minor characters and the episodic ones are a bit stretched out, but they are mostly pushed to the sidelines to let the main cast take the center stage. They\'re rather forgettable, but I think that\'s mostly because of the fact that they\'re quickly replaced and the show doesn\'t stop to let you drill them into your memory. Overall though, the cast does a solid job at making me want to see their misadventures continue.Now for the more technical aspects, this show is fair. Some of you who only saw the first three episodes may look at this and think ""This guy\'s an idiot"" and well.... you may be somewhat right. Akiba\'s Trip looks flat out ugly at some moments. Some movement, especially during a couple of action scenes, feel like characters are actually blobs, certain camera angles make them look like abominations and overall the art style looks silly. Everything I just mentioned I was able to spot within the first two episodes, however, this series did grow on me. The color pallet is probably as good as it could be, even if blue dominates it, there are so many contrasting elements that each scene is pleasing to the eye. The animation gets more exciting and sudden, which is a good thing. Action scenes include several strong sakuga moments, even if a bit short. All that really fits with the chaotic and explosive feeling the plot and characters give off. That\'s not to say it isn\'t flawed past the first episodes. The character designs are a bit too normal at times or way too out there at others (the main cast is designed very well though) and the CGI crowds tend to break the immersion. The music also works in the series\' favor, actually, it\'s probably one of the best parts of the anime. It\'s consistently good and fitting and has several good themes that I would gladly listen to on their own. I would assume it comes from the games, which could explain why the quality of the tracks is so good.The OP is rather simple, you probably heard similar ones, but it\'s catchy, fiery, the music fits the visuals exceptionally well and it made me ready for each episode with the right deal of excitement. It\'s solid. The idea for the ED\'s is really damn good though. Once again, the action takes place in Akiba, so what better way to end an episode than to showcase some up and coming singers or groups? Each episode has a different song, performed by a different J-Pop artist or an idol group. I can\'t say more than one or two stuck in my mind for longer than a second, but nonetheless this idea fits the theme of the series perfectly.My relationship with Akiba\'s Trip is that of a love-hate one. I can easily say that it was enjoyable as much as it could be. It was able to sell me on its story and characters despite me having extremely negative things to say about it after the first episodes. I am pretty sure this will end up being a disappointed to a lot of viewers. It\'s visual style is a big turn-off straight off the bat and the rest of it doesn\'t seem promising enough to continue. However, this series does evolve and starts taking clearer direction the more time it gets, especially as a weekly, bombastic series that one could watch after a long day of work or studying, at least it was so for me. It\'s definitely not one that works well for binging, but as an episodic one that you can watch every once in a while it may prove to be a surprise hit. With that in mind, I fully recommend Akiba\'s Trip The Animation. It\'s a fun bunch of episodes that may even be considered as longer skits. Comedy can\'t appeal to everyone, but when it\'s an overblown parody catered to otakus, I\'m sure some will find it enjoyable. Expect a lot of fanservice too. That\'s how this show rolls, and if you can\'t accept that at the start, you won\'t get anything out of it. With that being said, if you enjoyed reading this review, be sure to click the helpful button and check out some of my other reviews. Thank you for your time.As always, this is purely my opinion. I recommend you to develop you own. present you with Akiba\'s Trip The Animation, based on the somewhat popular series of games, this is probably the most explosive and bombastic anime of Winter 2017.The whole idea of Akiba\'s Trip is not one that I would call simple. Tamotsu and his sister Niwaka go to Akihabara, which just like in our world is a place full of otaku merchandise, anime, manga, maid cafes and such. In one of the shops with exclusive goods he meets Arisa, a busty girl from Finland and they quickly bond over figurines. Later he also runs into Mayonaka who is a part of defense group that protects the place from incidents, but it turns out there\'s more to it. Monsters invade Akiba and as Tamotsu rushes to save his sister he gets tangled up in the war between the two groups. He receives special powers that end up trapping him. Without much choice he becomes the protector Akiba deserved and desperately needed.Some of you may see this as a generic plot, but you forgot one part of it all- the title. Sure, you could just read it as a trip to Akiba, but if you could just take that s and put it next to the second word, you\'ll understand that this anime is going to offer more than just the plot. It\'s gonna offer all the ""plots"", if you know what I\'m saying *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*Ekhm... sorry about that.The way that the Bugged Ones - the previously mentioned monsters that disguise themselves as humans - are defeated, is by stripping them down completely. You can expect a lot of character fanservice in here, all damage is done through ripping off clothes so that\'s kinda obvious, but I feel like it\'s a very important part of all the craziness that it tries to portray.Speaking of the craziness, the most important part of it is the format of the show. It\'s like an episodic ""adventure"" type of a show with the last couple of episodes trying to create an ending for a season. It\'s something that I immediately connect with the cartoons that I watched when I was younger, kinda like Teen Titans or Ben 10. Putting this into an anime isn\'t anything new, far from it. It\'s been used a lot, but not in the way that those previously mentioned shows do. Akiba\'s Trip embraces itself entirely. It knows it\'s a trashy show and it should only concentrate on fun, possibly leaving some space for an arc at the end of it. I wouldn\'t say it\'s a justification of how the show lacks serious progression through over half of its runtime or how every story has to end in one episodes, it\'s just my way of experiencing the show and seeing it for what it is rather than as something it clearly never aimed for. This show doesn\'t try to be serious, even if may seem like it does, it always plays it for the laughs in the end. It\'s self-aware, knows who it panders to, often touches on the topic of who are otakus and knows its limits. I really appreciate how this series handles the topics of unity and the otaku culture. It\'s actually beautiful. Still, this leaves the viewer with the question: Is that enough?Now the answer will depend on the content of the episodes, so let\'s talk about that. As I mentioned, Akiba\'s Trip indulges itself in its trashiness. It makes the best decision it possibly could have made: it creates episodes for all the nerds out there.You watch wrestling? There\'s an episode about wrestling.You watch gaming tournaments? There\'s an episode about a gaming tournament.You watch porn? There\'s an episode about porn.Yes, I\'m serious.While the first episode is only a poor exposition, because it gives the impression of it being just an ecchi show, everything past that is pure madness. It doesn\'t have only one thing it uses, it has multiple ones that it completely overblows. And that\'s fun! Yes, it\'s the same formula over and over, the team meets someone who later turns out to be a Bugged One that they defeat by stripping him/her, but it manages to keep it fresh. You may think that its episodic nature will ruin the feeling of continuity or that the lack of connection could just turn it into a boring show that only has cool moments. Worry not, the cast is here to help.The characters are just as ridiculous and fickle as the plot. Tamotsu jumps from being a hipster to being a normie to being a mainstream fag at any convenient point. It\'s not because he is written poorly, but because he lives in freaking Akiba. You can find everything there, and so he tries all of it out one by one. You can say that he has an attention span of a dog. He\'s honestly a great main character for the series, easily relatable and constantly changing to be compatible with the current topic. Haven\'t you ever went through a phase in your life? That chunk of your precious time that you spent on only one type of entertainment over a certain period of your existence, like wrestling, gaming and such. Tamotsu is the embodiment of that, it\'s just because of the situation he found himself in, he changes his interests more often.The only character that could come close to  Tamotsu in terms of sudden changing is Arisa Ahokainen. She traveled all over the world and experienced many different things, but decided to roll with the squad in Akiba. This busty blonde from Finland is more of a companion than anything else, but she does have several unique features. She cosplays at all times, changing her clothes multiple times throughout an episode, her voice is very high pitched and her energy is endless.The other two group members are Mayonaka, who\'s just a tomboy with a baseball bat, and Niwaka, who ends up being a damsel in distress a bit too much. There\'s seriously not much to say about them, though their characters do progress and become more likable as time goes on.The main cast works really well off of each other, for example Tamotsu\'s and Arisa\'s clumsiness contrasts with Mayo\'s sense of duty. It\'s used in a pretty simple way: When a specific reaction seems to be the best one, the characters that can pull that expression off step up to the spotlight. It works rather well and gives off a feeling of good character rotation and solid comedic timing.The minor characters and the episodic ones are a bit stretched out, but they are mostly pushed to the sidelines to let the main cast take the center stage. They\'re rather forgettable, but I think that\'s mostly because of the fact that they\'re quickly replaced and the show doesn\'t stop to let you drill them into your memory. Overall though, the cast does a solid job at making me want to see their misadventures continue.Now for the more technical aspects, this show is fair. Some of you who only saw the first three episodes may look at this and think ""This guy\'s an idiot"" and well.... you may be somewhat right. Akiba\'s Trip looks flat out ugly at some moments. Some movement, especially during a couple of action scenes, feel like characters are actually blobs, certain camera angles make them look like abominations and overall the art style looks silly. Everything I just mentioned I was able to spot within the first two episodes, however, this series did grow on me. The color pallet is probably as good as it could be, even if blue dominates it, there are so many contrasting elements that each scene is pleasing to the eye. The animation gets more exciting and sudden, which is a good thing. Action scenes include several strong sakuga moments, even if a bit short. All that really fits with the chaotic and explosive feeling the plot and characters give off. That\'s not to say it isn\'t flawed past the first episodes. The character designs are a bit too normal at times or way too out there at others (the main cast is designed very well though) and the CGI crowds tend to break the immersion.

I recommend you to develop you own.', 'Another game turned anime adaptation, this better not have the video game adaptation curse because LA already had enough of shitty video game anime adaptations from 2016!!!...<LA after watching it>It\'s different in it\'s own quirky way...For it\'s introductory episode, Akiba\'s Trip does bring us the setting as well as how Electric Mayonnaise gets formed as well as the threat of the Bugged Ones and how to defeat them. After that?, it has an episodic format where a new Bugged One threat appears, Electric Mayonnaise stumbles or is directly influenced by the new fad of Akihabara or Tamotsu Denkigai voiced by Haruki Ishiya\'s latest craze to...defeat the Bugged Ones. Akiba\'s Trip using it\'s episodic format looks into the otaku subcultures through this setting, from fighting games, computer parts, card games, anime figures, idols, audiophiles and even pro-wrestling!. How Akiba\'s Trip look at these topics are wide ranging from knowing A LOT about it or just wanting to parody it using it\'s otaku subcultures as a foundation.If there is a flaw to all this is that because of it\'s episodic format, the main cast consisting of Tamotsu, Niwaka Denkigai voiced by Marika Kouno, Tamotsu\'s little sister, Arisa Ahokainen voiced by Yuki Nagaku a die-hard cosplayer and local tank of Electric Mayonnaise and Matome Mayonaka voiced by Rie Takahashi, the one who introduced Tamotsu and the rest of the cast to the threat of the Bugged Ones and love interest of Tamotsu though she\'s incredibly tsundere shy about it. The flaw is that there isn\'t much character development to the main cast as it\'s more about the episode looking at Tamotsu\'s latest craze or otaku subculture fad than it\'s character and that\'s where Akiba\'s Trip lacked heavily (Niwaka being the best example of this as she\'s more of a satellite character than anything until she gets focus later on). The defense to all this is that Electric Mayonnaise as a group does develop as a team in fighting the Bugged One of the week only solidifying their teamwork and we learn a bit more about Arisa to Tamotsu and Niwaka\'s sibling relationship (no it\'s not incest trust LA) to about Matome by the final arc but her a bit later. Even the Bugged Ones themselves are stereotypically hammy evil though there are some red herrings making the REAL Bugged Ones even more lacking and one-hit strip kills at times just to close the episode off. Akiba\'s Trip seems more to be focusing on it\'s otaku culture in it\'s forefront with it\'s characters on the background until they need development and LA doesn\'t fault the anime that much for that as the main cast DOES get developed somewhat cleverly over the course of the anime. LA\'s favourite character was at first Matome then quickly became a tie between Matome and Arisa, but ultimately it went back to Matome.If there is one saving grace to Akiba\'s Trip to it however, is that the animation is BOMBASTIC even outside it\'s ""battles""...allowing Gonzo to go all over the place, from purposefully low quality to the reference-crazy detail as hell moments to battles it gets into. LA just loves when Akiba\'s Trip and by extension Gonzo going reference and meta-crazy and knowing how self-aware it is which can be another saving grace to Akiba\'s Trip.Hmmmm...that voice cast seems familiar...ohh right, Marika Kouno, Yuki Nagaku and Rie Takahashi were all from Sore ga Seiyuu!...nice Gonzo bringing up another of your titles, the three even sing the OP and some of the ED\'s! *ahem* with it\'s voice cast, LA would say that Yuki Nagaku has very unique vocals and was a hoot to hear with her semi-Japanese cadence, Marika Kouno as Niwaka feels like she is projecting Rin Kohana from Sore ga Seiyuu and Rie Takahashi is voicing her typical vocals. Haruki Ishiya sounds very much like he was having a blast voicing Tamotsu and the impressive minor cast voice cast was GREAT to have as well.For an anime named Akiba\' STrip, the fanservice if anything is surprisingly light, sure there are the expected bra\'s and panties and occasional panty shots and the one-strip kill shots, but the anime doesn\'t focus on that all due to the meta-self aware nature of Akiba\'s Trip directing, the fanservice feels more like an afterthought that trying to deliberately leer at it\'s fanservice.The ""final arc"" of Akiba\'s Trip if anything does make the anime bit better for those people who wants anime with a bit more of an impactful and cohesive plot and this really puts the Electric Mayonnaise gang to it\'s max tension though the ""drama"" is given more as a detour than any actual drama and give much needed factor towards Matome as a character and her connection to the main villain of the series. A flaw to this is it\'s episodic otaku subculture element disappears however it should be noted that the ""bigger picture"" a la major villain of the anime plotline was touched upon A LOT during the episodic format but nonetheless, even with all these elements of the build up to character development to it\'s otaku subculture elements disappearing, the ending still brought back it\'s wacky own flavour it had during the episodic format with little details amongst the final arc of the anime and by that LA means that the final episode is essentially a literal FINAL DUNGEON with the BIG BOSS at the end! and it went in a blaze of glory on how the ending was executed and although it had allegories of otaku\'s nature and how parents look at them and it still kept it\'s bombastic atmosphere by the end of it and LA will praise this kind of ending and how it was handled.Akiba\'s Trip: The Animation being a very self-aware ""Bugged Ones"" of the week looking at the subculture of otaku\'s makes this video game anime adaptation rather a different breed of adaptation to say the least. It has it\'s flaws sure, but it\'s bombastic and self-aware nature and the comedy coming from that makes this anime adaptation either a guilty pleasure for LA or a very good self-aware parody anime about otaku subculture...nonetheless Akiba\'s Trip: The Animation for LA is an honest to god guilty pleasure for Winter 2017 for LA...flaws and all! defeat the Bugged Ones.

Normally I wouldn't bother for a series like this, however I felt it was important to try and point out some of the major issues that many people simply haven't addressed in reviews thus far.First of all, I have seen two major 'sides' when it comes to debate on this series. There is the side that argues that it fails on account of being an Akiba's Trip anime without referring back to the games from which it gets its lineage. Secondly, there's the camp that argues that the anime fails as a series in a traditional sense,...through fault of its characters, overall story and other such things. I'm of the belief that both camps are completely incorrect.As far as I'm concerned, Akiba's Trip is not a traditional anime, nor is it relying on the success of the game franchise it hails from. In fact, I believe that it succeeds for the same reason that the game it hails from succeeded in the first place. This anime is a celebration of otaku culture and Akiba itself. As a result, it casts aside expected conventions of a solid story structure, engaging characters and even its own plot to simply deliver on its purpose of celebrating the electric town of Akihabara.How have I gathered this? Well, firstly I'd point to the story structure. While the first episodes do indeed set up a narrative, a villain and a purported structure, the rest of the series proves that it has no intention on following through with this as would be expected. Instead, each episode is almost entirely self-contained, focusing on a specific aspect of otaku culture and Akihabara life in general. One episode it may be idols, another it's military otaku, yet another it's radio otaku. The focus is not on the characters or the story in these moments. It's to serve as a grand celebration of the reality it's taking inspiration from.I have been to Akihabara several times and I should emphasize that the enjoyment of this series is magnified many times when you have first-hand experience. Many, if not all of the buildings seen are real buildings. The occurrences within the 'plot' are exaggerations of daily life within those buildings and on those streets. In this regard, I'd almost say that this series wasn't even made for a wider audience. Many of the references and much of the humor seems to be directed specifically at people who frequent Akiba or are at least major otaku themselves.The humor is irreverent. Of course it is, why wouldn't it be? The story is already extremely silly on its most basic foundation, so it only seems natural that the actual gags would be even sillier. The humor is built very solidly on in-jokes that only those within the wider otaku community would be able to appreciate. This furthers my assertion that this series was never intended for a wide audience.The art is admittedly rather sub-par. Sometimes improved on by impressive character design and facial expressions, however the solid colour schemes, lack of movement and backgrounds that at times are indisputably just augmented photographs are hard to simply let-slide each and every time. I do however feel that certain elements of this are worth dismissing. As I have stated before, I feel this anime was never created with the intention of reaching a wide audience. I suspect that the budget was very low from the outset and that talented staff members from the studio were likely relegated to different shows. As it stands however, the art and animation is certainly nothing special and at times can be a let-down.An aspect in stark contrast is the sound design. The voice actors perform a serviceable job, with some notable exceptions being quite striking and impressive to boot. However the key is the music. Both background music which is at times directly lifted from the games to provide a cheerful and effective mood, as well as the variety of songs used at the end of each episode which I would suspect are likely a method of improving a lackluster budget. In any case, all failures are forgiven in the face of the monotone idol from the idol episode.The characters are a mixed bag indeed. The protagonist himself is frankly a delight as a result of how blatant he is in his lack of interest for just about every event of the story. Many episodes occur largely as a result of him indulging in his otaku desires and having them taken to a cartoonish extent. In the context of this show, I find it appropriate. It touches on the mindset of particular otaku communities rather well and at times, it feels as though he himself is a representation of Akihabara. The supporting cast are far more mixed, with segway-loli being hilarious in her very few scenes and miss Moi Moi being a constant barrel of fun with constant costume changes and contrived backstories. The only elements where this feels somewhat hurt is in the other two female leads, who often seem to take too much of a back-seat and lack personality themselves.Overall, I found this an extremely enjoyable series, especially in the context of what I believe it was trying to achieve. It's not a perfect series. Certainly not. If rated against other shows to try and live up to their standards, it would fall flat on many fronts. However if other shows attempted to live up to its specific standards, I can see it quite easily blowing many of them out of the water.Not the best series of this season by a long-shot. However in terms of raw enjoyment and appreciation for what it attempted to set out to achieve, I feel it would be doing the series a disservice to rate it below an 8. In its own particular playing field, I feel it knocked it out of the park. Here's hoping the last few episodes don't make me eat my words. through fault of its characters, overall story and other such things. I'm of the belief that both camps are completely incorrect.As far as I'm concerned, Akiba's Trip is not a traditional anime, nor is it relying on the success of the game franchise it hails from.

It's to serve as a grand celebration of the reality it's taking inspiration from.I have been to Akihabara several times and I should emphasize that the enjoyment of this series is magnified many times when you have first-hand experience. Many, if not all of the buildings seen are real buildings. The occurrences within the 'plot' are exaggerations of daily life within those buildings and on those streets. In this regard, I'd almost say that this series wasn't even made for a wider audience. Many of the references and much of the humor seems to be directed specifically at people who frequent Akiba or are at least major otaku themselves.The humor is irreverent. Of course it is, why wouldn't it be? The story is already extremely silly on its most basic foundation, so it only seems natural that the actual gags would be even sillier. The humor is built very solidly on in-jokes that only those within the wider otaku community would be able to appreciate. This furthers my assertion that this series was never intended for a wide audience.The art is admittedly rather sub-par. Sometimes improved on by impressive character design and facial expressions, however the solid colour schemes, lack of movement and backgrounds that at times are indisputably just augmented photographs are hard to simply let-slide each and every time. I do however feel that certain elements of this are worth dismissing. As I have stated before, I feel this anime was never created with the intention of reaching a wide audience. I suspect that the budget was very low from the outset and that talented staff members from the studio were likely relegated to different shows. As it stands however, the art and animation is certainly nothing special and at times can be a let-down.An aspect in stark contrast is the sound design. The voice actors perform a serviceable job, with some notable exceptions being quite striking and impressive to boot. However the key is the music. Both background music which is at times directly lifted from the games to provide a cheerful and effective mood, as well as the variety of songs used at the end of each episode which I would suspect are likely a method of improving a lackluster budget. In any case, all failures are forgiven in the face of the monotone idol from the idol episode.The characters are a mixed bag indeed. The protagonist himself is frankly a delight as a result of how blatant he is in his lack of interest for just about every event of the story. Many episodes occur largely as a result of him indulging in his otaku desires and having them taken to a cartoonish extent. In the context of this show, I find it appropriate. It touches on the mindset of particular otaku communities rather well and at times, it feels as though he himself is a representation of Akihabara. The supporting cast are far more mixed, with segway-loli being hilarious in her very few scenes and miss Moi Moi being a constant barrel of fun with constant costume changes and contrived backstories. The only elements where this feels somewhat hurt is in the other two female leads, who often seem to take too much of a back-seat and lack personality themselves.Overall, I found this an extremely enjoyable series, especially in the context of what I believe it was trying to achieve. It's not a perfect series. Certainly not. If rated against other shows to try and live up to their standards, it would fall flat on many fronts. However if other shows attempted to live up to its specific standards, I can see it quite easily blowing many of them out of the water.Not the best series of this season by a long-shot. However in terms of raw enjoyment and appreciation for what it attempted to set out to achieve, I feel it would be doing the series a disservice to rate it below an 8. In its own particular playing field, I feel it knocked it out of the park. Here's hoping the last few episodes don't make me eat my words."", ""It's pretty bad, but good at the same time. It's good to be bad, but he does not take himself seriously from the start and it's clear.The anime for many times has no meaning at all, animation is very inconsistent to bad, but it's very funny, fun, full of references to other anime and games (some really cheeky) and has some (few) great battles.The characters have no depth, but this was purposeful, Akiba is very well represented here, which is one of the highlights of the anime and the soundtrack is good.I found it ok, the anime fulfilled its role of being unpretentious.Ps: Sorry for...my english. T^T my english. T^T"", ""First, do not look at my rating/s. It is strictly based on enjoyment. I refuse to be a person who looks for flaws and assumptions only to ruin his enjoyment and memories of shows. And not to mention ruin the chances for others to pick a show just because someone trusted a stranger instead of them self.This review's purpose is to write how I experienced the show, what I remember specifically and what I liked and to spread positivity.If your overall experience is great, then changing something will only change the overall feeling. Which is not necessarily guaranteed to be a good thing as some...people might think. Something is what it is and that's why your overall experience was great. You are lying to yourself if you think you really want something changed.- What especially stuck with me during this show is the art, sound and how every factor that makes a show in general was executed during fight scenes. Just like with any show I don't think you get much grasp of the director's and the cinematographers (if they have the 2nd in anime development, in any case I mean a person with similar jobs during development) work during common scenes. Since this is a comedy and action you can expect it during action scenes and eventually scenes with an outburst of comedy, such an outburst that rivals movement/action scenes. Meaning that there is enough going on that it can feel like an action (as happenings) scene even without the real action (as action). During those instances you tend to notice directing. It all depends on the individual of course. You all perceive something differently and with more intensity. Worth to note: still scenes (moments) and common scenes aren't the same.During the fight scenes everything moves so smoothly and makes you follow. Whether or not they had innovative animation techniques (I refuse to look back in depth just to nitpick on myself) the fight scenes will most definitely give you the feeling that there's a lot of creative work done on them. And with the art style we have, the animation during fight scenes is matching. Or rather the art style makes the animation look even better.I don't have to mention the sound. The opening is one of the best I've heard and has a lot of replay value and gives you energy. The ost during the show also did not disappoint.The show handles it's surroundings or backgrounds greatly, as the composition of the scene, the characters involved and the feeling of how said scene continually keeps to get your attention so deep on what actually is the point of the scene, it all is mixed in perfectly to keep your focus on what is intended.The usage of colors in the show create the overall and happy feeling. An excellent match for the comedy parts of our characters. The character's designs are memorable and the color difference even helps them with that. For sure is a certain character the comic relief, char name spoiler inbound, warning you again, I mean our ari even though the show is cheerful anyway. However all the characters are likeable just like that. And the voices are made for them.Overall this show gave me everything I love about, well, shows with a happy and sunny vibe. And with my next sentence I also have to mention that it does capture the feeling of a game. (It's not necessarily an adaption, as It seems the characters are different.) What I mean is it's noticeable that it works as a game and an anime (and other stuff) so that's a thumb up.I need to get a physical copy of the game sometime. people might think.

I like myself a good Ecchi anime.I find it pretty cool and interesting how the anime is set in a modern, colourful society. I also like how the plot has superhuman powers but I feel like the technology used is a bit too unrealistic for the setting. The art is stunningly amazing and the video/animation quality is great, as well as having eye popping colours (and characters, which I'll explain later).I really like how the show starts and has fast paced and peppy songs. I'm kind of into that, but it would be a little better if they had subtitles for the songs....The character designs are pretty cool, with interesting personalities and colourful hair, as well as a couple of cool and...busty people *Cough, Arisa cough*. The fight scenes are awesome and some are just downright spectacular, with some casual moments to break the ice.Overall, this was a pretty great anime. Too bad it only has 1 season. Hoping for another season! The character designs are pretty cool, with interesting personalities and colourful hair, as well as a couple of cool and...busty people *Cough, Arisa cough*.

Hoping for another season!"", ""So I was originally gonna pass up this anime, I figured it was just another cookie cutter anime and really didn't think I would enjoy it. Optimistically I thought I might get a small amount of enjoyment out of it, but I never expected that I would have an absolute blast!Akiba's Trip is an anime that knows exactly what it is, what it wants to be, and is completely unapologetic about all of it. It knows that its a fan service-y anime and that means it will lose a lot on depth, but because of that it never allows itself to take itself too seriously.Despite...this the anime manages to pull off some damn fine comedy, constructs stories that are interesting for a 'villain-of-the-week scenario', and really absorb you into the world of Akiba. Combined with a good cast of characters whom all compliment one another in some way it's a wild ride right from episode 1.Fair warning, there may be some spoilers in these later sections, the point of the above summary is to go over the general idea of what I'll cover in detail later.Story: 7The story is NOTHING to be impressed about, it has a very basic premise. Simply put it's 'oh look bad guys doing bad guy things watch the good guys do good guy things' with the added 'if you get stripped you lose' bit at the end. It is every bit as ridiculous as that sounds, but that's ok. Like I said this anime never takes itself too seriously, it knows what it is and what it wants to be and isn't interested in playing up ANY level of melodrama. It's only goal is to get a few laughs and it accomplishes that which is why I rate it so highly because the story effectively exists in service OF that comedy.Art: 6Again, the art itself isn't super impressive and the animation is just the 'yup that's anime' level of animation. What REALLY sells this art is the characters. You can tell based off every character you meet that the creative team really ran with the idea that hair color is indicative of whether someone is a Bugged One as a lot of these hairstyles are pretty imaginative. Especially in the main cast whom all seem to function well as a whole, artistically speaking. Unfortunately, animation is a real big deal to me so I can't really rate it too highly. However, the fact that the characters be they side or main were all fun to just look at speaks volumes to the care that went into crafting them. In my opinion at least.Sound: 7The sound direction was pretty on point in regards to SFX. I like my SFX to be realistic and the show stays true to that for the most part, and I especially liked the sound effect for when a Bugged One was disrobed really sold that feeling of 'whoohoo they did it!' The music choice, much like everything else, was ok. Nothing really wrong with it, nothing really great about it. What's more important than that was the timing, good sound direction can turn almost anything into something great and this show provides a really standard example of that. A general rule is that the music should never lie to the audience, if its a good moment then the music should reflect that. If the situation is dire again, the music should reflect that. The music choice coupled with the timing of delivery really sold those situations perfectly and it works well with this anime. Again, it's still nothing spectacular. But I rate it highly because the sound direction made me notice things that this wasn't just another lazy anime, someone really put effort in and I can appreciate that.Comedy: 9This is a special category that I'm adding in here because it deserves this recognition. It's really interesting how comedy ISN'T one of the genres used to describe this anime because in my opinion the comedy is the shining star of this anime. The action scenes are ok, nothing fantastic. While the setting creates a 'supernatural' feel sure, it doesn't steal the show. And yea, the fan service is fairly abundant (which while being abundant I must say it was at least tasteful and not just blatantly shoe-horned in) but fan service has never made an anime great it just gives it sex appeal so it can sell well. No, the COMEDY is where this anime stands in the limelight. There is a rule of thumb about comedy that I adore when speaking in regards to skit comedy, 'When you put a crazy individual in a world of normal people, or put a normal person in a world of crazy people, that's where the comedy happens.' and this anime EXEMPLIFIES this. It took me a couple episodes to realize, but in this anime YOU are that normal person. YOU are the one in the crazy world because everyone in this show is NUCKING FUTS! I would go so far as to say that the comedy in this anime could even stand up to the likes of konosuba, which was also brilliant with it's comedy. It's the fact that this anime blatantly and unabashedly goes for the most outlandish, far left field idea they can go for and  they make that WORK. By episode 3, I found myself on the edge of my seat just excited to find out what wacky and zany adventures these idiots were gonna find themselves in next. No, the comedy is the true star of this show even if it wasn't meant to be.Overall: 8So there you have it. This show manages to combine mediocrity with greatness in various areas, especially with its comedy. The end result is a world you can get absorbed in, characters you can care about, and good times that will always manage a laugh out of you. An exciting adventure, and a conclusive and satisfying ending with a neat little cliffhanger for a potential second season (Fingers VERY much crossed). So in short, top recommend.TL;DR:Watch it, it's worth it. this the anime manages to pull off some damn fine comedy, constructs stories that are interesting for a 'villain-of-the-week scenario', and really absorb you into the world of Akiba.

It was also full of references to many other anime's which was great to see the show make fun of because it worked really well with what was happening in many of the situations that happened in this show.The characters were very likeable and funny Tamotsu is pretty much a big Otaku, but he isn't stupid he actually knows quite a lot of things like at some point his knowledge of electronics actually saved the day plus his none serious and lazy attitude was also really funny and different for once since you don't really see that many male MC's with this personality, but when the time called he can be a kind and protective person depending on what the reason is. Matome is a Tsundere that finally is really likeable true she does hit Tamotsu and makes him do patrols for the Bugged ones, but she actually has a fun personality once you get to know her and even at times she wasn't being serious which shows she can be pretty lose and damn can she eat a lot of food. Arisa is another one of those characters that has the sweet and energetic personality which is always a win for me, but she has a lot of surprises in store like she has a very complex life and is actually very smart plus the funniest aspect of her character is that she always end's up in a different costume well of course she's a cosplayer, but the outfit's she wore sometimes were just hilarious because they seemed so out of place. Niwaka is difficult to decipher mainly because she isn't in some episodes and can't fight against the enemies because she doesn't have powers, but she felt likeable anyway because she didn't do anything to annoy and there were some scenes that she did something that was actually funny.The other supporting characters like the Professor who always travelled on her Segway and couldn't even fit in her lab Coat and the many villains were actually pretty good and it was hilarious seeing how over the top the villains were and how easy they were to defeat was also a funny site too.The artstyle felt similar to Kill la Kill not the way the characters were made, but how it was used because a lot of the scenes where someone was being sarcastic or being over the top just reminded me of that show plus for some reason characters like Kage-san just reminded me of lego because their face's were so expressionless just like the lego faces.The comedy was just fantastic there were cliches like the Deus ex Machina cliche that were used as jokes plus there was were a few 4th wall breaks which were pretty funny too, but the characters are what made the show really funny because of their none serious attitude my smile hardly disappeared because it was that funny to watch and the fact that ripping people's clothes off just to defeat also reminded me of High School DxD and to me that's always a good thing. The action though short was pretty fun I liked Tamotsu and Matome's power's and how Tamotsu gained these powers was actually quite surprising although I think I've seen it somewhere before.Overall this was a friggin hilarious show if you want something that sorta works like Kill la Kill with it's comedy then you're definitely in for something epically amazing. group of teens defending a section of town from weird monsters I was surprised to see how well this show worked because I can definitely say it was one funny ride because no matter how dangerous the threat got these group of characters never really got serious about it and seeing shows take the usual cliche that you see in a lot of other anime's and use them as jokes was a delight to see, not only that seeing this group of characters defeat the threat was also really funny like a video game battle, a eating competition and even a card game too.

Matome well she one of the female leads and the original defender of akiba she is a tough chick with Tamotsu and also defending akiba she does get angry a good few times at Tamotsu but that's it otherwise she a pretty tough but also nice girl. Arisa is another female lead she is a pretty good fighter aswell not a bugged on but she can kick some butt she is also kinda like Tamotsu that he is a Otaku at heart (well maybe not at heart as him but close) otherwise a pretty good and decent character overall. Niwaka is the sister to Tamotsu and the last female lead in the anime honestly she cant really fight or do anything really so there just to help them with other stuff also she does like her brother (not like incest love btw) otherwise a decent character and a nice and kind one at that. Tasujin is a supporting character and is a scientist to the there group Electric mayonnaise she would basically provide stuff on to help them battle the bugged ones a decent character overall.Enjoyment: Things that i liked: the comedy was here and there it took awhile for the comedy to really get me but later on it was good and the action was damn good for the most part and the characters were all really well done for the most part. Things that i didn't like: again the comedy to was here and there it really to me AWHILE for it to actually get me to laugh out loud if anything most of the anime was like me smiling also that one of the characters Arisa i felt was kinda here just for the fan service (also sorry for spoiler shes never a bugged one) so yeah and also every time she would say moi or whatever it was she said was kinda annoying i could see people not liking her.Overall: it was hard for me to give this a 7 or a 8 or even a 7.5 but in the end i just went with a 8 i think for me the comedy got better for sure as the anime went along and that the action was damn well done and also i loved most of the characters that made this anime really well done i would recommend this anime tamotsu has to team up with matome and others to defeat them and keep Akihabara safe.Art: the art is pretty good for this anime the action parts with it art really detailed in this anime.Sound: the OP is decent the ED changes after like every episode so i cant really say which one i liked also i watched the dub it was pretty good.Character: Tamotsu is the male lead of the anime and he is a Otaku at heart loves getting figures, loves girl bands and just everything anime also when it comes to fighting the guy is a damn good fighter otherwise a cool and nice guy.

Things that i didn't like: again the comedy to was here and there it really to me AWHILE for it to actually get me to laugh out loud if anything most of the anime was like me smiling also that one of the characters Arisa i felt was kinda here just for the fan service (also sorry for spoiler shes never a bugged one) so yeah and also every time she would say moi or whatever it was she said was kinda annoying i could see people not liking her.Overall: it was hard for me to give this a 7 or a 8 or even a 7.5 but in the end i just went with a 8 i think for me the comedy got better for sure as the anime went along and that the action was damn well done and also i loved most of the characters that made this anime really well done i would recommend this anime"", ""This isn't an anime good to see if you are looking for a good story that change every episode with plot twist or something like this. This is an anime to see if you want to laugh and spend time. The question is... You can't take this anime seriously if you want to enjoy it.I am liking this anime so much because the main character and the blonde one. Tamotsu don't act like an usual ordinary main character of an ecchi anime.And... I think this is it. Sorry for the bad english if I made some mistakes in spelling, and enjoy the anime :) "", ""Hey there, this is my first review and I would like to do it to express myself and let people know if this is the kind of anime that you would like to watch.First, Akiba's Trip The Animation is not related to the game's story, this means that you will not see the main characters of the game and their development along with the story of it but a whole new cast and a new story instead.The reason why this anime caught my attention was because of the name of the game, but I was slighty disappointed when I saw that it wasn't related to...it, although I changed my mind after the first episodes and a very specific one (avoiding to spoil) that made me hook up with the anime.So lets begin.Story: As mentioned before, don't expect the game's development here but hey, don't let appearances fool you, this doesn't mean that it will automatically become bad or mediocre, the approach of this one is actually more of a parodic style and.. I like it, I'm having fun with it laughing a lot with certain episodes and enjoying the rest of them.Each episode is pretty much independent, they have their own setup that doesn't follow a straight line with the plot, kinda like a cartoon so if you're a viewer that doesn't like these stuff and want instead something else with a story development I don't suggest this to you, but if you don't mind that or you're interested in it, you'll have some fun times out there!The story isn't solid, but the anime can talk by itself with its episodes.6.4/10Art: I like the art, but I think it's just something fine. There are some aspects of it that I like that are unique used in a comedic way and the character design is good-looking.6.5/10Sound: Nothing much to say here. I like the opening and the seiyuus are good, the sound effects aren't surprising but they're fine, no complaints here.6.5/10Character: I personally find the characters here pretty appealing and have their own personalities well-built. You won't find them flat, generic or lacking something.7/10Enjoyment: This is the strongest point of the anime in my opinion, becausewhat it really matters is how you interpret something, even if it's not the greatest thing in the world, you can make it better in your own way. You can enjoy this anime even if it doesn't have the best story or anything similar as long as it is done well.I have been enjoying this anime with each episode.7.1/10Overall: It's a good anime, not the best one out there but I feel that it's pretty unique and it defends well by itself, you'll have fun with the characters and the things they do during the episodes, each episode having a different mini-plot, and plenty of other things.And here is the last score7/10 it, although I changed my mind after the first episodes and a very specific one (avoiding to spoil) that made me hook up with the anime.So lets begin.Story: As mentioned before, don't expect the game's development here but hey, don't let appearances fool you, this doesn't mean that it will automatically become bad or mediocre, the approach of this one is actually more of a parodic style and..

I considered to get and try it out before watching this anime, but I figured out, based on available anime info, that that would not be necessary.I've seen a lot of complaints about the tasteless ecchi, but after a few episodes, I failed to notice that, heck, there is barely any ecchi here (there are naked women, stupid outfits, etc. but if you look deeper, you can see my point), and even where there is naked skin on screen, the studio failed to draw it as even remotely appealing......you could say that people that worked on the animation, really have no taste.This is more or less comedy oriented anime. There is an overarching action/supernatural plot, but they never really expanded on it too much and it quickly turned to episodic anime that mostly cares about its gags. And given the priority to comedy above everything else, they rarely went beyond the most average jokes you could write. The same applies to the slapstick, it works only now and then. So it at least could squeeze some chuckles out of me. But what totally put me off from watching it more are the characters. I have nothing against two MCs, I like the design and sometimes even the quirky personalities. However, I almost fully despise most of the side characters and villains. There is annoying foreign sidekick who only serves for same stupid ecchi moments and it has something wrong with her face, ugly and unlikable enemy designs, random side characters that have so-called stylized designs, which still doesn't make them any good.And yet, there is a character so bad, that I was ashamed each time she was on screen. It was that stupid doctor. Everything, even the stupid name, is wrong with her. She has one of the most god awful designs I've ever seen in anime, with horrible color combinations, with cliche personality and even bad back story. And you can bundle the other doctor friend/villain with her, just as bad. God, I hate them both so much.So yeah, despite all that is wrong with it, it still made me watch a little more and I had on and off fun on few these episodes. In other words, not a complete trash, it even manages to be perfectly average sometimes. you could say that people that worked on the animation, really have no taste.This is more or less comedy oriented anime.

I\'m actually a little sad that it\'s officially over.Each episode had a new villain in a long line of villains, and each sort of represented one...hobby and/or obsession prevelant in otaku culture, and thus, in Akiba itself.Such examples ranged from competitive video gaming, to the exploitation of Idol Singers, to Ham radios and manual cameras, to military fanatics.Surprisingly, as the group in the show increased in membership, their bonds deepened, and for such a short comedic show, that\'s actually quite the accomplishment.So, while the show is no where near as intelligent in its satire as say, Saiki K, it\'s still really funny and totally a great way to enjoy yourself on a boring night.If you liked ""Haven\'t you heard? I\'m Sakamoto"", ""Mob Psycho 100"" or "" Saiki K"" you\'ll probably enjoy this too. I\'m liking this new wave of actually funny anime that pokes fun at our ridiculous culture that we hold so dear.Also, even though each episode stands alone great, there is actual continuity and a vague storyline thats ""there"" just enough to make you want to see the next episode and see where our oddball crew will end up next.Anyway, thankfully this is based off the game of the same name, so you can always play that if you truly want more of what the anime had to offer. hobby and/or obsession prevelant in otaku culture, and thus, in Akiba itself.Such examples ranged from competitive video gaming, to the exploitation of Idol Singers, to Ham radios and manual cameras, to military fanatics.Surprisingly, as the group in the show increased in membership, their bonds deepened, and for such a short comedic show, that\'s actually quite the accomplishment.So, while the show is no where near as intelligent in its satire as say, Saiki K, it\'s still really funny and totally a great way to enjoy yourself on a boring night.If you liked ""Haven\'t you heard?

Otaku parody, paired with a bit of action and romance. Lightweight, no deep thinking required, with an ""awwwh"" moment every now and then.________________As other reviews already stated, Akibas Trip is basically a hit & miss for every single episode (apart from the first and the last 2-3 ones I guess).Overall -If you are into otaku / nerd stuff, give it a try.. you might like it. If you are only in for the romance, you can watch the first 1-2 episodes and then skip to episode 10.I was a bit unsure because...of the rather low 6.70 rating, but I actually quite liked it. There definitely are worse ways to spend your time.Story & Content -Most of the episodes don\'t follow a big story / plot, instead they are small stories, known from e.g. Rick & Morty. The whole show itself is pretty lightweight, and focuses big time on paroding different otaku/nerd stuff each time.. which is the hit & miss part about it, might be you find yourself laughing your ass off at one episode and being bored on the next one.There is an action aspect to it, which isn\'t badly made, although the protagonists never have any real struggles when fighting the opponents, so it\'s rather some extra sugar on top.The final few episodes are the actual plot of the story, nothing spectacular and pretty straight forward, but if you watch this show for a deep story you\'re in the wrong place anyway.There is also romance to it, to the point that I don\'t get why this show doesn\'t have a romance tag.. after all, there are many shows out there labelled as romance with way less romantic content in it. There are 4 kiss scenes throughout the show (although 2 of them can hardly count because of the circumstances), a date episode and an ending which leaves no doubt.Art -The art style itself is okay, nothing fancy but not bad either, pretty much the average modern anime art style. The art style sometimes seems lazy (considering scenes with crowds like a concert), but it doesn\'t bother much either. And for some characters they obviously wanted to make them look ridiculous, as to push the parody even further.Character -Just like for the story, the show doesn\'t care about having deep characters. They have some backstory you get to see, and their behavior is pretty understandable and consistent, so no issue here. of the rather low 6.70 rating, but I actually quite liked it.

What can I possibly say to justify this? It’s exactly as stupid as it sounds. Now, obviously you can see this as a bad thing (and most of you possibly will). The question is, does Akiba Strip use this to its advantage or does it rely on its “hilariousness”? Well, sadly it is the latter, most of the time. Akiba Strip is self-aware and that may be its biggest weakness. If I compare...it to Kill La Kill for example, which had a similarly ridiculous premise, that show played it straight, which made it work so much better. Akiba is not doing much to flesh itself out and therefore often falls flat. Due to its episodic nature, focusing on one nerdy fandom after another, it also has the problem, that if you are not into the subject matter of the episode, it will be a very boring one. The things it did tackle that I personally had interest in (or at least some basic knowledge of) did just fine as standalone episodes. But subjects I didn’t know or care about left me bored at least 1/3 throughout its run, since the overall “plot” didn’t help me making it through at all.3/10Art:Akiba Strip looks very cheap for the most part. Well, actually it looks cheap all the time. Character design and animation is all okay, even though it’s far from being special, but backgrounds and especially background characters did not get much attention. I am also pretty sure they reused quite a few shots, like when the girls had one of their gigs. The special effects looked fine, but they are nothing to write home about really.5/10Sound:I was excited to hear all three members of Earphones together once again, as I have enjoyed watching Sore ga Seiyuu. And sure enough, they all do a really good job. The whole cast seems to have enjoyed voicing their characters, which is great. The music…well, I am not a big fan of J-Pop. At all. But I would be lying if I said that the song the three girls are performing wasn’t catchy as hell. The opening not so much, but it’s definitely okay. Each episode got a unique ending song, so if you’re a fan of that kind of music, you’re in for a treat.8/10Characters:To be honest, the main cast is very shallow. The hero is an outgoing hothead, who just happens to be a complete nerd for all kinds of things. Not a very relatable character though, as he often acts like a dick towards the others. In a comedy this can be seen as funny, but it heavily depends on the viewer. I would be a hypocrite to call him out for it, since I enjoyed KonoSuba mostly for the characters being assholes. The leading lady is a stock tsundere and not much else. The same goes for Tamotsus little sister, whose main characteristic is being the main characters little sister. Arisa is the only one of the girls to have somewhat of a personality, being the funny foreigner with a surprising amount of talents in many, many fields. Bonus points for making her Finish instead of being from one of the done to death countries like the USA or the UK. We also have a couple of exposition characters, who felt very unnecessary besides that, I think it could’ve been done just as well without them. Some of the enemy of the week characters were funny, like the Yu-Gi-Oh guy or the pro gamer girl, but many of them didn’t click with me. Finally, the main villain was a total Ragyou rip-off (wether this is a good or a bad thing, I leave it up to you).4/10Enjoyment:As I mentioned earlier, your enjoyment level is proportionate to your amount of knowledge on the subject matter of the episode. I had a lot of fun with the ones I knew about, like the TCG episode or the wrestling one. Others left me bored, like the gun episode. Akiba Strip (let’s be honest, that’s the real name of the show) didn’t do a good job to season the subjects to viewers who aren’t into them and the overarching plot didn’t really help either. Thankfully the grand finale was just as ridiculous as the whole show, I wouldn’t have bought a serious ending. In total, this anime isn’t very good, but it is watchable and sometimes quite funny. I’d say, pick out the episodes that deal with stuff you like and enjoy them, disregard the rest.5/10Overall:5.0/10 it to Kill La Kill for example, which had a similarly ridiculous premise, that show played it straight, which made it work so much better.

It avoids the trap of coming off as insufferably smug about “being” otaku in a way that has echoes of some of Gainax's more self-indulgent titles in the 2000s, or...recent series like Twintails, but a limited ambition means it never matches them.After getting killed in the crossfire between the neon red headed Matome Magonaka & the body-snatching Bugged One's, Tamotsu Denkigai finds himself brought back by a kiss, gifted with superhuman powers but trapped forever in Akihabara. What might sound like hell to many is no such burden to him though, there not being a thing about the district he dislikes. There is one other catch, however. If he or any other of those caught up in the battle for Akihabara lose their clothes, they die.For the first episode, anyway. Akiba's Trip plays fast & loose with its initial setup, which may annoy some but in truth is for the best, given what the show wants to be: a light-hearted journey down the rabbit hole of the various fandoms & hobbies associated with Akihabara. Most episodes pick a target & proceed to see how deep that hole goes, though not to the point it stops being about the fun, before Bugged Ones show up to try & ruin it.To that end, Tamotsu makes for a better protagonist than some more well known “otaku” leads recently. Given that the series is less interested in him & his Electric Mayonaise (his choice) gang & more about using them as a conduit into that episodes subject, he avoids exhibiting the insecure, aggressive “otaku pride” that, for example, makes Saekano's lead so unbearable. The characters in Akiba's Trip have all already joined to dark side, so to speak, so never really feel the need to explain or defend themselves to their peers or the audience, even as they defend Akihabara.On the flip side, though, this means that those hoping for a more character focused comedy in the vein of Konosuba will be disappointed. Most of the humour relates to whatever fandom is up that episode, or else more broad ecchi & otaku humour. None of the characters really develop beyond their archetypes: Mayonaka is the tsundere with a crush; Arisa Ahokainen is the bubbly  blonde; Tasujin Ratu is the loli professor & so on. While the main trio do occasionally take turns as leads, they never really change or develop, it even being a recurring joke for Arisa that nothing about her back story really makes sense or connects.But as a celebration of Akihabara & its idiosyncrasies, it's pretty fun. If there's a theme that connects the mostly episodic escapades, it's celebrating the diversity that can be found in this den of geekdom. While plenty of jokes are at the fandom's expense, it's never judgemental. Indeed, as guardians of Akihabara, it's that diversity that they're defending, mainly from Bugged One's looking to monopolise the district with some shady scheme. Even the government gets called out, with a jab at “Cool Japan” & a corrupt minister trying to shut the “immoral” district down.If there's one thing Akiba's Trip needed, it's a recurring villain. While one emerges for the inevitable dramatic turn in the final three episodes, for the most part it's just Electric Mayonaisse facing off against random Bugged One's, who at times almost feel like an intrusion into the episode. It would have been nice to see a villain working behind the scenes to bring down the Akihabara everyone loves, rather than just assuming one's there because there was a sinister looking woman in episode one & we've seen enough anime to know how that works. They'd have also somewhat offset the lack of development among the main cast by giving an alternative point of view to view the episodes from. At the very least, it would have been nice to have someone end each episode shouting “I'll get you next time, Akihabara!”For a production that might be politely considered rough & ready (with emphasis on the rough as the series progresses), you'll be under no misconception about who made it, given that Gonzo seem to slap their name on at least one thing each episode. The production team seem to be going for a look that is comparable either to the “loose” adherence to character models that was positively received in Konosuba, or else perhaps has hints of the kinetic style of Hiroyuki Imaishi. The former is probably more apt, since while Akiba's Trip does have some fun & energetic action sequences, it never matches the feel of Imaishi's work at Gainax & Trigger.Fittingly, given the setting, Akiba's Trip has a very idol otaku targeted soundtrack. As well as the OP by idol unit Earphones there's a different ED for each episode, with an introduction to each group to make sure you know who's singing. How high profile the acts are, I couldn't say, though the Milky Holmes singers feature. The OST is, unfortunately, mostly forgettable, if unobtrusive. There is definitely one track that sounds like Girls Just Wanna Have Fun by Cyndi Lauper, though.Still, while it could have been more, Akiba's Trip is still a fun time. The characters, though shallow, are a laugh, Akihabara is an entertaining setting & all in all it's a generally enjoyable series. But there's a large crowd of similar anime out there, & Akiba's Trip does enough to get in, but not stand out. recent series like Twintails, but a limited ambition means it never matches them.After getting killed in the crossfire between the neon red headed Matome Magonaka & the body-snatching Bugged One's, Tamotsu Denkigai finds himself brought back by a kiss, gifted with superhuman powers but trapped forever in Akihabara.

It would have been nice to see a villain working behind the scenes to bring down the Akihabara everyone loves, rather than just assuming one's there because there was a sinister looking woman in episode one & we've seen enough anime to know how that works. They'd have also somewhat offset the lack of development among the main cast by giving an alternative point of view to view the episodes from. At the very least, it would have been nice to have someone end each episode shouting “I'll get you next time, Akihabara!”For a production that might be politely considered rough & ready (with emphasis on the rough as the series progresses), you'll be under no misconception about who made it, given that Gonzo seem to slap their name on at least one thing each episode. The production team seem to be going for a look that is comparable either to the “loose” adherence to character models that was positively received in Konosuba, or else perhaps has hints of the kinetic style of Hiroyuki Imaishi. The former is probably more apt, since while Akiba's Trip does have some fun & energetic action sequences, it never matches the feel of Imaishi's work at Gainax & Trigger.Fittingly, given the setting, Akiba's Trip has a very idol otaku targeted soundtrack. As well as the OP by idol unit Earphones there's a different ED for each episode, with an introduction to each group to make sure you know who's singing. How high profile the acts are, I couldn't say, though the Milky Holmes singers feature. The OST is, unfortunately, mostly forgettable, if unobtrusive. There is definitely one track that sounds like Girls Just Wanna Have Fun by Cyndi Lauper, though.Still, while it could have been more, Akiba's Trip is still a fun time. The characters, though shallow, are a laugh, Akihabara is an entertaining setting & all in all it's a generally enjoyable series. But there's a large crowd of similar anime out there, & Akiba's Trip does enough to get in, but not stand out."", ""Akiba's Trip was a really fun show. After reading the synopsis it may sound like it's all about fan service but I think it's more about the humor. Even the fan service is more humorous then provocative. I'd say its main focus is on the otaku culture and using that as a source of humor. It does it in a way that pokes fun while also paying homage to it. If you're new to anime then I don't think I'd recommend this one. Also if you're going to watch it for the fan service then you might be disappointed. There's no real nudity and all...of it is more for laughs than anything else. I was good with this because comedy was what I was looking for and that's about all you can expect from this show. As long as people go into it with that mind set I think they'll really enjoy the show. of it is more for laughs than anything else.

However, I want you all to also understand that this anime have no relation to the story of the game in any way and that it is not an adaptation. If you're watching this anime expecting it to be an adaptation, you could watch on hoping it will suit your taste or you could move on with your life. You may be wondering why this anime have the same name as the game since it's not an adaptation, the reason is simple. The basis behind...both the game and this anime is that it revolve around these particular species that are similar to vampires. They will die under sunlight if they are exposed enough. To defeat these creatures, you must strip them. That's it. Simple.Now enough about the game, let me move on to the anime. This anime, essentially have an original story using the basis of the game, the vampire-like species. A note before you advance to this anime, the first 10 episodes, have no plot what so ever, basically like a slice of life anime that shows random things and hobby that the main character have. While the anime may be weird (Yes, it is really weird), it is actually rather enjoyable for me to watch. If you're looking for the ecchi element, the only things you'll see are character being striped naked and half naked characters, there really isn't any thing else. At least not that I remember.On to the art style, I'll rate it a 7 in my books. To me at least, it's quite a generic common art style these days, so nothing much to comment here. Though it's also not badly drawn. Basically it's a likable style that are common.For sounds, I'll rate it an 8. It have quite a few catchy music and while there's only one opening song, there are quite a few different ending songs. I like the short catchy moment during an action scene and there isn't really any music that I dislike.Character wise, I can't really rate it. The character are really unique when compared to other anime. They each have their distinct personality and would be hard to rate. At the minimum, I can tell you that there are none of them that I hate. All the characters are rather likable.I have to say, despite it being weird overall, it is really enjoyable to me. It's an anime with no real serious plot and that it has many funny and strange moments. As long as you don't have any real expectations for it, you'll definite enjoy it.Overall, it's weird. I'll definitely recommend it if you want something that have many strange/weird moments. Also, keep your expectations low for this anime. The action are simple and quick, no real sense of plot, and basically very random throughout.

Bakuon!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30795/Bakuon,"[""If you've watched K-ON, Gochiusa, Kiniro Mosaic or any of the hundreds upon hundreds of cute slice-of-life anime out there, you've already watched Bakuon.People like these shows for a reason, as evidenced by the massive amount of BluRays and merchandise they tend to sell. I'm fine with them, and presumably anybody who would give something like Bakuon the light of day is fine with them, too. But when the only thing distinguishing them from one another is what gimmick they can throw in (in this case, motorcycles), there begins to be a problem.It is especially apparent that the motorcycle aspect of Bakuon is more...background to the girls being cute and sexy and stupid and whatever. It will likely please biking fans with its references to and jokes about specific motorcycles and brands, but it never goes into detail and is largely superficial. Bakuon needed some way to distinguish itself from other shows in the genre, and, hey, biker girls is fresh or something, right? It's a bit of a shame, since other Cute Girls anime like K-ON have already shown that something meaningful can indeed be done with the girls' club activities. Biking can be more than an excuse to animate boobs jigglin' with the wind, and while it occasionally tries to go a step further with Rin's and Chisame's backstories, it never goes quite far enough.Anybody seeking realism is, obviously, not going to get what they are looking for here. Bakuon breaks physics and sense on a regular basis. The girls get air-time so big they put Hollywood to shame. Heck, one of the motorcycles is even sentient! And God is a motorcycle otaku! And all the males wear masks and have their faces hidden for whatever reason. Bakuon just don't give a damn. It knows its viewers are not going to take anything it has to say seriously, and so it amps the lunacy up to twelve. It's okay with being dumb. It doesn't want to take itself seriously, and it doesn't need to. I'm cool with Bakuon in that regard. At the very least, it already puts itself above some other shows in the genre by keeping the drama to a minimum and focusing on why people are watching a show like this in the first place: comedy and cute girls, with an emphasis on the cute girls part. If the choice is between bad drama and minimal drama (I certainly would not trust Bakuon to handle it with any sort of grace), then I will choose the latter without hesitation.There are some striking-- almost scary-- similarities to K-ON here, particularly with regards to Chisame, the show's late addition to the cast. A year passes and Chisame, as one of the new first-years, joins the bike club, much like Azusa from K-ON, and initially shows reluctance and a distaste for the club's silly behaviour, much like Azusa, before giving in and growing an attachment to it, much like Azusa. She also has twintails, much like Azusa, and the exact same freakin' last name, right down to sharing the same kanji. Maybe they're long-lost siblings? Something to think about.Whether you will enjoy Bakuon or not is largely dependent on your interest in girls with twintails, as the other girls are sure as hell not going to appeal to anyone. You have your Yui clone, presumably a victim of intense brain damage, your Ritsu (who now has frizzly and messy hair), and your Tsumugi, an ojou-sama with a butler attending everywhere she goes. Yawn. Rin and Chisame are the only ones with character, who aren't completely one-dimensional and who actually bring some life to the show. Rin has a legitimate reason for loving biking and brings passion to the show as a result, while Chisame provides an outsider's perspective to the world of motorbiking along with her amusing deadpan humour, and is so adorable that you will want to reach out and squeeze her whenever she appears. (Chisame also looks like Nico. And Rin has big boobs. I thought I should mention that.)Bakuon does not attempt to hide the fact that the girls are there primarily for sex appeal, what with all the close-up shots of their boobs jiggling, Rin's (naked) butt shaking in the camera's vicinity and taking up approximately 90% of the screen, and them cleaning their bikes (in a swimsuit, by the way!) by grinding and rubbing their genitals all over them. One of Rin's most defining physical characteristics is that she has a motorcycle logo branded on her butt. Bakuon is pretty weird.I am not someone who believes sexiness is inherently wrong and should be banned from all media. Sexiness is fine. Rather, the issue I have is that most anime force it in where it is entirely unnecessary. If it's a story about, say, a gravure idol or a girl working at a hostess club, it is more than welcome. A group of high school students playing mahjong or music, on the other hand? Not so much.Under ordinary circumstances, then, I might criticise something like Bakuon for the aforementioned scenes. But honestly? The T&A is one of the only noteworthy things about the entire show. You take that and the motorcycle gimmick away and you're not left with much else. So I'll take the sexy biker chicks who masturbate themselves via their motorcycle, if only because I can't imagine Bakuon being even less of a show than it already is.But I'll also admit that, despite all its issues and lack of anything meaningful or noteworthy, I still enjoyed Bakuon more than I expected to. It starts off quite rough, and it's only towards the end that it establishes its characters and figures out what it wants to be. For those last few episodes (9 onwards), I genuinely did have a good time with it. It's not a bad anime by any means. It's fine. It's OK. It has heart. And it can be more when it wants to be more - it just doesn't try nearly as much as it should.Boring? Sure. Uninspired? Absolutely. But you can go a lot worse than Bakuon if you're just looking for cute anime girls to keep you occupied. background to the girls being cute and sexy and stupid and whatever.

But you can go a lot worse than Bakuon if you're just looking for cute anime girls to keep you occupied."", 'Pretty interesting work coming from a former adult doujinshi artist.During my time watching, I was not impressed with the way Bakuon!!was introduced. I understand that originality in anime & manga has been dead since the earlier 2000\'s (my opinion, everyone else has their time-line of when it stopped.) however Bakuon\'s story, while somewhat unique, still failed to bring anything exciting to the table... or in this case TV.  Unfortunately creativity was the biggest thing that hurt the story.  The plot and story are both simple, which is somewhat good, but also feels very plain. I felt like the producers were afraid to break...the barrier a bit (no crash pun intended) and branch out the story. During the time I spent watching each episode, it was as if the team that worked on Bakuon weren\'t trying their best to make it really stand out. If I was watching television in my hotel room in Japan and I saw Bakuon on and decided to watch it, I would probably change it due tom the lack of engagement and exciting developments in the story.  In all honesty I wasn\'t in the least bit interested in the show. Bakuons appeal? it\'s pretty much just your little below average moe title. Think of it like this, ""what if the K-On girls were on motorcycles?"" or ""what if the Lucky Star crew was on motorcycles?"" I mean at least they were not playing card games on motorcycles but I digress. Not every episode in Bakuon is equally strong. For the most part episodes felt unbalanced because one episode the main focus or plot would be about a character getting their license then next episode would be about a hot spring. So as far as the plot goes, there was no ""set plot."" This is of course common in the world of Slice of Life anime. Overall the story doesn\'t meet my expectations. It is too simple-minded and focuses a tad too much on sponsoring motorcycle companies whilst trying to add  some sort of ""cuteness.""Characters designs looked like they were ripped off.. or heavily inspired by Kakifly\'s K-ON! which is something you\'ll see more than once on my review. Hane stood out the most for inspirational use. I\'m not sure if maybe the original creator was going for a moe look or what his deal was but It just wasn\'t working. Aside from that and I actually had to do lots of Googling for information on the oringal creator because the way the show is set up I seriously thought that Kakifly (Creator of K-ON!) worked on this show or at the very least helped Orimoto with the character designs. In my research I found out that Mimana Orimoto was actually a doujinshi-artist that focused more on adult work which I find both uncommon but also very interesting because this show is to my knowledge, his first published work that isn\'t hentai. I also found it very interesting that none of the characters from his doujinshi\'s or self published work share no visual similarities with the Bakuon cast which is good. Now I think that if you read the manga you\'ll notice the K-ON similarities the most however the anime does a better job getting rid of those distinctions. Animation was pretty good for the most part. I was moderately impressed with the racing scenes in the show. I think the only thing that kept me from actually enjoying the races was that the animation wasn\'t over the top. Like if I watch something like Initial D movies, even though the animation isn\'t on par with Bakoun the animators were still able to make the races and drifting look pretty damn good! Lastly, special effects look great, background settings look wonderful etc. I think the art and animation was pretty solid overall.The sound wasn\'t anything special either. The background music is lackluster at best. The opening and ending song while catchy did not get me excited to either watch the show or stay for the previews or warning sign (lol.) The voice actors in the show failed to leave me with memorable impressions based on their peformances. This of course was something I was upset about considering that all the seiyuu\'s have had some pretty great roles... well maybe not Rikako. It depends on whether you liked the shows she was in. Freezing was okay but... wait a second, let me get back on subject here. I felt like the sound department was reletivly weak in general. One thing that I did admire though was the sound effects. I watched Bakuon on Crunchyroll via PS4 and because I have surround sound along with a soundbar by Bose set up around my television. Whenever the girls got on their bikes hearing the engines revving along with them racing sounded so freaking great! Perhaps my favorite episode was maybe episode 9 or 10 where Nakano was sharing her experience racing with other people and the sound of her whizzing by the other racers was epic! it would travel from one speaker to another and because of the way my speakers are set up it, with the bass, it felt like, and sounded like they were racing in my room!I mentioned earlier that characters looked as if they were ripped off.. or inspired by Kakifly\'s K-ON! Hane stood out the most for inspirational use. This is because she looks like Tsumugi Kotobuki, has the personality of Tsumugi, and Yui hirasawa. In addition to that, her relationship with her Imouto or Little sister reminds me of Yui and Ui\'s relationship in K-ON! Rin reminded me of Ritsu Tainaka. Sort of Tomboy-ish, cute, and when she puts her mind to it dependable. Mio I see a lot in Raimu shy, timid at first but when something excites her she gets super happy and her personailty changes. This is what I mean what I say it\'s like the characters ripped off. Better yet, they seemed more like copy & pasted archetypes and personalities you\'d seen in any other anime series. As mention earlier there were no major character developments other than minor mental thought processes or characters loving certain brands of bikes, just little things. I was not, too impressed nor satisfied with the little women of Bakuon!!What I find pretty interesting is that no matter how many times  I found myself becoming unsatisfied with episodes, I would still find some interesting developments to help me enjoy the show.  I think the word I\'m looking for is ""fun."" No matter how bad episodes seemed they were still fun to watch and I really admired that about the show. I had a good time watching the girls enjoy themselves on their bikes.Overall I would have to say that Bakuon!! is hit or miss. The show has its strengths and weakness, and it makes it somewhat difficult for me to decide what rating to give it based upon everything I mentioned earlier. In addition to the rating, I think that the show obviously needed more work, especially in the story & the characters department.  Perhaps if the show had more ""originality"" then I would have gave it a 7 however I think Bakuon!! is fairly good in all departments despite its lack of creativity. 6.5/10 from me! the barrier a bit (no crash pun intended) and branch out the story. During the time I spent watching each episode, it was as if the team that worked on Bakuon weren\'t trying their best to make it really stand out. If I was watching television in my hotel room in Japan and I saw Bakuon on and decided to watch it, I would probably change it due tom the lack of engagement and exciting developments in the story.  In all honesty I wasn\'t in the least bit interested in the show. Bakuons appeal? it\'s pretty much just your little below average moe title. Think of it like this, ""what if the K-On girls were on motorcycles?"" or ""what if the Lucky Star crew was on motorcycles?"" I mean at least they were not playing card games on motorcycles but I digress. Not every episode in Bakuon is equally strong. For the most part episodes felt unbalanced because one episode the main focus or plot would be about a character getting their license then next episode would be about a hot spring. So as far as the plot goes, there was no ""set plot."" This is of course common in the world of Slice of Life anime. Overall the story doesn\'t meet my expectations. It is too simple-minded and focuses a tad too much on sponsoring motorcycle companies whilst trying to add  some sort of ""cuteness.""Characters designs looked like they were ripped off.. or heavily inspired by Kakifly\'s K-ON! which is something you\'ll see more than once on my review. Hane stood out the most for inspirational use. I\'m not sure if maybe the original creator was going for a moe look or what his deal was but It just wasn\'t working. Aside from that and I actually had to do lots of Googling for information on the oringal creator because the way the show is set up I seriously thought that Kakifly (Creator of K-ON!) worked on this show or at the very least helped Orimoto with the character designs. In my research I found out that Mimana Orimoto was actually a doujinshi-artist that focused more on adult work which I find both uncommon but also very interesting because this show is to my knowledge, his first published work that isn\'t hentai. I also found it very interesting that none of the characters from his doujinshi\'s or self published work share no visual similarities with the Bakuon cast which is good. Now I think that if you read the manga you\'ll notice the K-ON similarities the most however the anime does a better job getting rid of those distinctions.

We may see it sometimes these days in other form of mediums such as live action films. But, how about a series that dedicates itself about cute girls riding motorcycles as a way of storytelling? An anime adaptation produced by TMS Entertainment. Bakuon!! is a show with a lot fun with cute girls doing extreme things.In a way, this show reminds me somewhat of K-On! There’s the club with a prominent cast of female characters each with their own unique personalities. For instance Onsa reminds me somewhat of Ritsu with their tomboyish characteristics and is easygoing with their friends. The characters...also comes from different backgrounds and each episode gives more insight on their individual stories. From the cast, Hane stands out as the most noticeable character as she gets directly involved in the story from the beginning. Her relationship with the others brings out a lot of about her character and as time goes on, we can see how their bonds grow. And speaking of bonds, the show establishes a very casual atmosphere with each episode highlighting daily adventures of the club.Indeed, the story of Bakuon!! is fairly loose despite some background storytelling on occasions; such as the instance about Rin. Every episode is more of a standalone that features the girls and what they do as part of their daily lifestyle rather than linear storytelling. It also involves motorcycles and the comedy it ensures. The show sells its comedy from a variety of angles. However, this can feel a bit distracting at times with unintentional fan service such as an episode about motorcycle washing in bikinis. For the most part though, the show’s comedy style is fun to watch with running gags and dialogues. It also cleverly uses imagery depicted through character interactions to get the most of itself. There’s even some occasional events that can seem out of the world such as an episode featuring Hane’s encounter with a “holy being”. Nonetheless, the humor of the show can be a big deciding factor to whether you decide to watch Bakuon!! or not.The show is also known for characterizing its brand well for most parts. Some of the most noticeable eye catches are Hane’s Honda that reflects the choice of her logo or Rin’s obsession with Suzuki. Onsa’s Yamahas and Raimu's Kawasaki are also good examples with the latter featuring a nice spotlight in one of the episodes. In essence, the branding of the motorcycles is also important because it shows why the girls are interested in their choices. It also reinforces the meaning of their character names that gives the viewers a nice representation of them. So in some degrees, it has a feel of realism.In terms of adaptation content, the show can be a hit or miss. I confess that there are a few episodes really took the cut which makes it a bit frustrating for those who are looking for faithfulness. Also, character designs are somewhat modified with lesser details such as Onsa’s hairstyle. On the other hand, the show is consistent in maintaining character personalities that is pretty parallel to the manga. It’s not a perfect adaptation but not too shabby either when you watch it with an open mind.In terms of animation style, Bakuon!! is simple with its character designs. Surprisingly, it adapts the motorcycles’ designs quite well with consistency in colorful mechanics. There’s a decent amount of fan service present in the show such as Rin’s design and various camera angles. The teacher in particular is a walking billboard of fan service when she’s drunk with her yuri-like characteristics. There’s even an episode with the girls washing their bikes while wearing skimpy bikinis. Still, the show itself is mostly tame.Soundtrack is mostly moderate with nothing really to write home about. The OP and ED theme songs are playful with lighthearted choreography. It features all the main characters and the motorcycles of their choices. Character voices is also pleasant and the voice actresses adapts their roles quite well on most parts.It’s not a complicated show to watch. The premise is simple and the character cast is fresh with a diverse range of characteristics.

I'm still hoping for a cute girls show about drug rehab or something along those lines.Since I am a filthy cave dwelling dweeb I did enjoy this show...on a raw personal level, since each of the girls was seen in very proactive clothing and pandered to the otaku fan base while also having some genuinely fun moments intermixed within the show.The plot is pretty much the same as every other show of this type. New girl joins school, gets roped into joining a new school club and in this club, finds a new passion in her life. It's a basic formula for a basic show. The rest of the episodes are pretty episodic and don't really have all too much in the way of story development or all too much characterisation outside of their individual quirks. Some of the jokes and comedy could sometimes feel kind of forced and jarring and if you're not a bike fan some of the jokes will probably fly over your head as it did with me.Despite that, there were plenty of scenes and moments I generally felt were pretty funny and entertaining, earning a small chuckle here and there, and it certainly entertained me week after week but is still ultimately forgetful.Character designs and animation could be pretty meh, and sometimes could look off model and strange. The animation is pretty standard and If was improved, it could of helped with some of the joke delivery a little better. The bikes, when in motion were pretty much all CG and didn't blend to well with the 2D backgrounds.Overall Bakuon was a fun ride with fun characters, but aside from that, doesn't really offer anything unless you're a huge motorbike fan, or a fan of Rin's tits (and those are some big tits). It's hard to recommend this show since there are so many other shows of this nature that do this so much more better. on a raw personal level, since each of the girls was seen in very proactive clothing and pandered to the otaku fan base while also having some genuinely fun moments intermixed within the show.The plot is pretty much the same as every other show of this type.

Described by the author as a light hearted ""High School Girls X Motorcycle Comedy"", Bakuon delivers just that in a nice slice of life package. As a motorcycle enthusiast myself, it\'s refreshing to see an anime genre that I otherwise would have cared nothing about stepping out into some new themes. As far as I know, Bakuon is the first example of an anime about motorcycles- which definitely earns it points for originality.The character archetypes, however, may not be the most original, but the personalities implanted into them give them a lot of life and variance from the typical moe moe SOL...desu offerings rampant every season. Enter Hane, the airhead, idiot character. After getting smoked on her bicycle by a motorcycle on the first day of school, Hane decides that she\'s going to go out and get a motorcycle. At school, she meets up with fellow enthusiast Onsa, the sensible, gear head who knows all about bikes. After they decide to form a club with the resident Stig Raimu and spoiled, dimwit rich girl Hijiri armed with her butler, the group is set... except for one: Rin.In every group of motoring enthusiasts, there must always be that purist- an insufferable, near rabid fanatic of one brand, and that brand only. Embracing all the flaws, or a severe case of  denial, this lover of all things < insert brand > can be your best friend, or worst enemy. In this case... Rin is the worst enemy of all bikers- an intolerable Suzuki addict.Each character in the story also represents a different manufacturer and aspect of the typical personalities you find in bike culture, so there\'s a little something for everyone who cares about such things. We have the veritable bike encyclopedia in Onsa, extreme fangirl in Rin, the noob in Hane, the ""money fixes everything"" in Hijiri, and the racer in Chisame. If there\'s one thing Bakuon does really well, it\'s getting the bike culture feel right- with tons of references and factual, true statements about different machines (and their riders), and a lot of in-jokes for the raiders among the viewing populace. Raimu-senpai is the Stig\'s Japanese Schoolgirl cousin, and Ducati and Euro-bike riders get mercilessly crapped upon, as they should. No one is safe however, even the 4 major Japanese brands. Kawasakis leak, Hondas don\'t start cold, Yamaha transmissions break, Suzukis have electrical problems, everyone gets crap!That said, Bakuon is not for everyone. This show is targeting a very niche audience of motorcycle enthusiasts, and is about the last manga I expected to be picked up for animation. People expecting some kind of lesbian romance or drama will be sorely disappointed. With a handful randomly placed, but rather tasteless sexual humor moments, there\'s a few nuggets for the fanservice lovers among us, which I didn\'t enjoy very much. This show is a slice of life in its purest form however: just a group of chicks, their bikes, and the adventures they go on. For me, I laughed all the way through, just as I did with the manga, and an enjoyable romp it was, even if it was just a brief 13 episodes.Things Bakuon gets right:- almost perfect adaptation of the manga- no stupid romance- informed bike humor, things only people invested in the culture would get- factual information about the bikes in the show, and other bike culture- The StigThings Bakuon gets wrong:- unnecessary fanservice- calling Onsa frizzy (translator error, but this is my place to complain)Watch if you like motorcycles and bike jokes, otherwise, give it a pass. desu offerings rampant every season.

If you don't like motorcycles or have zero interest in them, skip it. If you DO like motorcycles.. it's a fun ride!Each girl has a make that they favor and a big opinion to go with it, leading to fun squabbles, and they all possess different enough personalities to make a fun dynamic. Yes, they're basically the archetype for anime (rich girl, tsundere twin tails, tom boy, quiet  and shy, and dopey but lovable) but in a series like this that doesn't take itself too seriously, it works. Let's...not forget the one that doesn't totally fall into an archetype; The Stig. Er, Raimu Senpai.It can be a tiny by ecchi sometimes, but never gratuitous, and it generally adds to the shows laid back feel.The art for the girls and scenery is adequate, but the art for the bikes... gorgeous. They're super detailed and look amazing. Just like how the tanks  have great care paid to them in Girls Und Panzer, the bikes here are a treat to behold.It's summer, the wide open road is waiting.. if you went out and got your motorcycle license after watching School Rumble (guilty) this will be just what you need to whet your appetite for the wind in your hair and 750cc lump of Japanese steel between your legs.

Later on another character gets into the main cast, Chisame Nakano voiced by Ibuki Kido who is one year younger than the rest of the cast and has more experience than Hane (*cough* Azusa from K-On!) and their team dynamic just gets even better. If anything the character group dynamic and the similarities LA keeps pointing out, the character roster feels like a parodied fanserviced version of K-On!.On speaking of fanservice, the fanservice in this anime is rampant from some very yuri play to full out nudity to some typical hot springs episodes here and there from most of the cast yet LA quite liked it. (Sue LA that Rin got the most fanservice and LA could quickly ignore the rampant fanservice all because of her)The group dynamic of the cast helped the comedic and rather weirder moments of this anime and again fleshed out the cast at the same time. The comedy and random/Chekov\'s Gun moments really does make this anime for what it is worth from the character jabbing to again the weirder moments of this anime, for example, Jesus giving Hane a miniature Suzuki Cup...yes this actually happened, LA would praise the author of Bakuon!! with the insanely funny moments of this anime as it just made LA\'s day whenever LA watched Bakuon!!.Sure this anime has lots of advertisement to the motorcycles that the main cast rides like Suzuki, Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki and Ducati, but these advertisements is taken with a grain of salt and thankfully they don\'t push the advertisement of the bikes in our faces...just add in fanservice and it just goes away...*ahem* take that as a good thing, this anime IS about girls and their motorcycles right?.The animation by TMS Entertainment, the animation had times of animation derps here and there yet has lots of high detail when concerning the bikes and racing.

Rin and the fanservice and just the weirdly crazy plots these girls take just absolutely made this anime a guilty guilty guilty pleasure for me from start to finish. Mio from K-On!) is LA\'s favourite character, but the other cast members such as Hane Sakura voiced by Reina Ueda the ditz and rookie come well-trained club member to the Motorbike Club and talks her hobby (*cough* Yui from K-On!), Onsa Amano voiced by Yumi Uchiyama are tomboyish and have moderate expertise and often butt heads with Rin (*cough* Ritsu from K-On!), Hijiri Minowa the ojou wanting to do something different from her ojou-life (Mugi from K-On!) to Raimu Kawasaki the mute senior of the club who is has the most experience yet fails in the most outrageous ways were damn well memorable in their own right with their quirky personalities and love of motorbikes. Later on another character gets into the main cast, Chisame Nakano voiced by Ibuki Kido who is one year younger than the rest of the cast and has more experience than Hane (*cough* Azusa from K-On!) and their team dynamic just gets even better. If anything the character group dynamic and the similarities LA keeps pointing out, the character roster feels like a parodied fanserviced version of K-On!.On speaking of fanservice, the fanservice in this anime is rampant from some very yuri play to full out nudity to some typical hot springs episodes here and there from most of the cast yet LA quite liked it. (Sue LA that Rin got the most fanservice and LA could quickly ignore the rampant fanservice all because of her)The group dynamic of the cast helped the comedic and rather weirder moments of this anime and again fleshed out the cast at the same time. The comedy and random/Chekov\'s Gun moments really does make this anime for what it is worth from the character jabbing to again the weirder moments of this anime, for example, Jesus giving Hane a miniature Suzuki Cup...yes this actually happened, LA would praise the author of Bakuon!! with the insanely funny moments of this anime as it just made LA\'s day whenever LA watched Bakuon!!.Sure this anime has lots of advertisement to the motorcycles that the main cast rides like Suzuki, Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki and Ducati, but these advertisements is taken with a grain of salt and thankfully they don\'t push the advertisement of the bikes in our faces...just add in fanservice and it just goes away...*ahem* take that as a good thing, this anime IS about girls and their motorcycles right?.The animation by TMS Entertainment, the animation had times of animation derps here and there yet has lots of high detail when concerning the bikes and racing. Yes, it\'s inconsistent yet LA didn\'t mind the animation and thought that the animation got better at some point.Does LA need to say anything about the voice acting, considering LA...-sigh- ""typically"" LA\'s favourite voice actor goes to the tsundere shy Nao Touyama, though Yumi Uchiyama who voiced Onsa needs to get special mention as both Nao and Yumi\'s chemistry together with their banter really made the comedy even better.LA would hate to admit it, but this was LA\'s guilty pleasure of Spring 2016 and no it wasn\'t just because of Rin, but the crazy antics the cast went through ""drove"" LA to carry on watching no matter how weird the plot gets as simple as it is about a high school girls biker club.

However, what may turn people off is the constant motorcycle jargon (models, companies, etc.), as to be expected for such a series. I do give credit for all of it being true, as the company/models mentioned do exist. Other than that, the stories being told were lackluster.I can’t really say I enjoyed the characters that much. They certainly had their own personality that distinguished them from each other, but never went farther than that. We don’t get to learn anything about them...outside of what model they ride and how proud they are of riding them. We even get an introduction to a new character during the last few episodes, which makes their appearance for the rest of the show useless.The animation was, by far, the worst thing about the show. This pertains to the character models, specifically the eyes. Almost every episode had moments where the eyes were disproportionate to the point where it was distracting. Although saying the story is mediocre, I wouldn’t minded it had the animation been consistent.Overall, Bakuon was a hit and miss for me. Honestly, I found interest because it showed many similarities to K-On. If you’re into motorcycles and/or cute girls riding them, then this might be for you. If you’re not too familiar with motorcycle trivia, then it may not be to your liking. outside of what model they ride and how proud they are of riding them.

We all know they\'re going to go for Suzuki because Rin = best grill of the series.[Story]If you\'ve seen a ""cute girls doing cute things"" type of anime before then Bakuon is no different. Well, there are slight changes here. Instead of ""Cute girls doing cute things"", it\'s ""cute girls doing cute things in a motorcycle"". I haven\'t seen that before. No, really, I haven\'t so a show featuring cute high school girls riding in a...motorcycle is new for me. Except the formula is nothing new as the show is still the same old ""cute girls doing cute things""The story of Bakuon is basically a high school girl named Sakura Hane who got interested in motorcycles after tirelessly going up a hill countless times using her bicycle. That hill was, of course, part of her route to go to school. She realized that going to school in a motorcycle was far more easier than using her bike. From there on, the crazy antiques begins. Hane, who knows nothing about bikes decides to join a bike club with other members who are a bunch of motorcycle savvy nerds and knows a lot about motorcycles and sometimes they even argue on which brand is better.I came in to this show with no expectations and I ended up enjoying this series far more than what I would have expected. I\'ve always been a sucker of motorcycles ever since I was a kid so don\'t tell me that Bakuon! influenced me to go out there and buy a motorcycle because that\'s clearly false. If you ask me, I\'ve always wanted one of those Kawasaki 1000cc motorcycles.One of the many things that I enjoyed about Bakuon!, besides the motorcycles, is the comedy. For the most part, the comedy is surprisingly good. I mean, at times you can tell they were trying hard but most of the time, the comedy scenes would make me laugh. Few examples are when characters compare each other\'s bikes and they argue over the bike\'s flaws and how Suzuki is a very flawed motorcycle.The show also has quite a lot of product placements for Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Yamaha\'s motorcycles. Now the question is, who payed who (Did the show\'s producer\'s paid the motorcycle companies or was it the other way around?) and how much? There\'s also some fan-service moments in the show. The most notable one is when Hane decided to clean her bike in a ""lewd"" way or that quote that I don\'t think I\'ll ever forget which was:""My butt\'s vibrating""  -Hane 2016______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (8.5/10)TMS Entertainment did a good job with the show\'s visuals and its character designs. The visuals looks pretty average when the girls are just messing around in school but the visuals excels when the girls go for a ride in their motorcycles. There\'s only one thing that I want to talk about in terms of Hane\'s character design and that\'s her eyebrows. I have to admit that it looks cute. On the other hand, the animation was decent. What bothered me is the fact that they used still-shots sometimes when the girls go on a ride. I know this is a slice of life and I shouldn\'t expect much in terms of animation but it was seriously off-putting at times.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (9/10)The soundtrack is just your average soundtrack which you\'d expect in a slice-of-life show so they\'re not worth mentioning. Now, the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is ""FEEL×ALIVE"" by Sayaka Sasaki. Man, the title of the OP theme song just predicted how I felt about the OP. It\'s super catchy, the melody is awesome and it made me feel alive whenever the OP theme song comes up. The ED theme song is ""Voon! Voon! Ride On!"" by Hane, Rin, Onsa and Hijiri. The ED theme song is nothing really special. I was just in it for the ED animation which was pretty funny when I first watched it.I don\'t usually review the voice actors but for this show, I just have to because of one voice actor. I love Hane\'s VA and her performance. She sounds super enthusiastic all the time and that\'s the part that I loved about her, which in turn, made me like Hane\'s enthusiastic personality.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (7/10)Hmm, what can I say about the characters? Bakuon has a fun cast of characters and the weak character development, especially Rin, wasn\'t taken seriously and they were there just for the laughs. Though, I have to admit that Rin\'s past had me dying in the f*cking floor. I want to talk about the characters next.Hane Sakura is my second favourite character in the series due to her enthusiastic and charming personality. She rides a pink Honda CB400SF and nice choice by her because it looks like a nice motorcycle.Next up is Rin Suzuki which in my opinion is the best girl in the series. It\'s not because of her gigantic melons but it\'s because I feel bad for her. I mean, the cutest girl in the series getting bullied by that ""Frizzy"" girl just because she owns a Suzuki motorcycle? Hah, I just love the hilarious arguments between Rin and Frizzy. She rides a Suzuki GSX400S Katana which doesn\'t even look that bad. Is Frizzy saying bad things about Katana because of the specs?Next up is Onsa Amano.. I prefer calling her ""Frizzy"" because Rin\'s right about her messy-ass hair. I just wish Frizzy and Rin can get along because I can clearly see a hidden yuri love here and they surprisingly work well together when they get along.Next up is Hijiri Minowa. She\'s your typical rich girl but she doesn\'t know how to ride a motorcycle properly even though she has a motorcycle license. Instead, she rides in a Ducati outfitted with a side car. She sits in the side car and her butler rides the Ducatti.Last one is Raimu Kawasaki. She\'s the weirdest and the most mysterious character I\'ve ever seen. She wears a helmet which means we never get to see her face throughout the series and she never said one word throughout the series which makes me quite suspicious of her sexual orientations. How do we know she\'s a ""she""? How do we even know she\'s a high school girl?______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (8/10)Say what you want about the series being a ""cute girls doing cute things which has been down over a million times by now"" but I still enjoyed the series.

Now, let me tell you, this anime is like a motorbike that looks cool, but doesn't quite live up to the hype.First off, the story is a bit all over the place. It's like they threw a bunch of motorcycle-related ideas at a wall and just went with whatever stuck. And don't even get me started on the talking motorcycle. It's like Knight Rider, but with a lot less David Hasselhoff.Now, the voice acting is decent enough, but the real star of the show is the sound design. The motorcycles...all sound awesome, and the revving engines will get any gearhead's heart racing.As for the music, well, it's forgettable at best. It's like elevator music for motorcycles.Overall, I'd give a score of 6.555/10. It's not the worst anime out there, but it's not exactly a masterpiece either. If you're a fan of motorcycles, it's worth a watch, but don't expect too much.--------------------------------------Selamat datang, teman-teman wibu penggemar kendaraan bermotor, di ulasan saya tentang Bakuon. Sekarang, biarkan saya memberitahu Anda, anime ini seperti sepeda motor yang terlihat keren, tetapi tidak sepenuhnya memenuhi harapan.Pertama-tama, ceritanya agak berantakan. Seperti mereka melemparkan sejumlah ide terkait sepeda motor ke dinding dan hanya mengambil apa saja yang menempel. Dan jangan biarkan saya memulai tentang sepeda motor yang bisa berbicara. Ini seperti Knight Rider, tetapi dengan David Hasselhoff yang lebih sedikit.Nah, pengisi suara cukup baik-baik saja, tetapi bintang sesungguhnya dari pertunjukan ini adalah desain suara. Semua suara sepeda motor terdengar luar biasa, dan mesin yang dinyalakan akan membuat hati siapa saja yang suka kendaraan bermotor berdegup kencang.Sedangkan untuk musiknya, ya, itu mudah dilupakan. Ini seperti musik latar untuk sepeda motor.Secara keseluruhan, saya memberikan nilai 6,555 / 10. Ini bukan anime terburuk di luar sana, tetapi juga bukan mahakarya.

I was most shocked to see actual brands in this show such as amazon, but also all the motorcycle brands, helmet brands and the such. Character types are very typical and not very creative. the main character and her sister are like Yui and Ui from K-ON! down to the hair color and their respective personalities. motorcycle engine noises aren't anything to rave about, and could've been more interesting had they added some actual race flair, but it's just about moe girls liking motorcycles. Bunta...from initial d is straight up in this, along with suspension noises, and the Hachiroku makes a cameo in one of the episodes. Essentially you have an interesting mix of K-ON! and Initial D, which gives you some great fanservice for fans of both the anime. from initial d is straight up in this, along with suspension noises, and the Hachiroku makes a cameo in one of the episodes.

The question is, how much did they do with said gimmick? A lot actually. They talk about bikes all the time, they ride them all the time and most episodic plots are about motorcycles, so I\'d say the potential is fully utilized. Since I don\'t know anything about these vehicles, I can\'t judge how accurate they handle the subject, but it looked like they did well. The comedy is varying heavily, from cute shenanigans to perverted fanservice. I...don\'t mind either, but sometimes it felt like I was watching two different shows.9/10Art:The bikes all look pretty good, as far as I can tell. The girls surprisingly fall a little flat compared to the background characters, who are much more detailed. The body proportions look a little weird at times too. Overall, I\'d say it shines when it needs to, but could have been better.6/10Sound:I\'m a big fan of the ending, but the opening isn\'t too bad either (though nothing special). The voice acting was absolutely solid, though rarely extraordinary. I don\'t remember much background music, the sound effects of the bikes sounded realistic though.7/10Characters:Out of the 5½ main characters, Rin and Onsa were the most memorable. To me it felt like Rin was more a parody of a tsundere than an actual one, which was kinda nice. Onsa is an interesting mix between ""dirty old man"" and ""only sane person"". Also, her hair looked awesome. Hane fell a little flat compared to similar main characters (see Anne Happy for example), but she was still okay.

Welcome to Bakuon!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There's simply nothing to gush about when it comes to the basic plot of the show, rather what isn't explained outright is that this show is an absolutely irreverent parody of the subject matters it features- complete with random scenes of sheer absurdity drenched in over-the-top -and at times, subtle- goofiness.Which brings us to question just what on earth does it make fun of? Biking perhaps? Why of course, the whole thing is essentially about biking, but it makes fun of it in...spades! And what else does it make fun of as well? Oh plenty really, anything from traffic laws to business practices- not to mention the characters themselves whom are all relatively quirky, downright bizarre and completely ridiculous at times.The script is also relatively well paced and imaginative, wherein it's loaded to the brim with various situations where >70% of which is outright designed to be soaked in comedic value. Other than that, there are also a few surprisingly charming but brief scenes spread throughout the show centering around such topics like friendship for instance.But above all, if you can't already tell, this show is a parody of K-ON!Plot & Themes/Script & Dialogue Rating: 7~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On the visual front, there really isn't that much to comment on actually. Generally speaking, the show is decently made. The art is well-drawn, and while the colors can be slightly over-saturated at times, they are at the very least rich, vibrant and 'poppy'. The designs of the backgrounds and characters on the other hand aren't meant to break new ground, but are at least creative and distinctive. There're also plenty of real-life visual references in the form of scanned magazines, posters, photographs and artwork.Animation-wise, this show is surprisingly well-animated at parts, especially when it comes down to the character movements and comedic scenes. The 3D-rendering of the bikes in the show is also rather impeccable- exquisitely detailed down to the most minute of particulars, the bikes themselves move very seamlessly on screen with very little to no choppiness in fact.There're also several instances of experimental or at least, out-of-the-norm animation and artistic techniques being used in the anime, and the lighting -which utilizes extensive bloom to create the show's distinctively warm and bright look- and particle effects greatly enhance the visual appeal of the show. The camera-work is also very creative and the shots well edited to great effect, all flowing together very well in many of the scenes thus creating a consistently seamless viewing experience.The OP sequence is a well-made though only somewhat creative sequence which introduces the characters and their bikes, before proceeding to showcase them embarking on a road trip in its second half. The ED sequence on the other hand is very comedic and simple, with mini versions of the characters on their bikes journeying back to school.Art & Animation Rating: 8~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For one, this show's sound design is bloody amazing, wherein an appropriately joyful rock-oriented (BIKES = ROCK- PERIOD) soundtrack featuring some uncommon track structures and musical timbres, in addition to more conventional bluesy and poppy rock tunes, and various other goofy and idyllic tracks utilizing an eclectic selection of instruments used in the more slice-of-life moments drenches the show in an inviting musk of gleeful hilarity that's just simply hard to shake off.Not only that, the sound effects themselves are superb- ESPECIALLY the greatness that is the bikes' engines... OOOOOHHHHHHH PURE ECSTASY. Ahem, I mean, in general they are carefully chosen and professionally made but yeah you get the point, no complaints there.But hold it! There's just one more part that we MUST absolutely discuss before going in any further and that is the ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC voice acting! Oh God, the voice acting, the sheer amazing balls that is the voice acting is what REEEEAAAALLLYYY makes this show shine. Skilled, emotive and hilarious, the voice acting for the characters are all incredibly well done, with the only hiccups possibly going to the 'extras' on screen. However! The one character who received the BEST voice acting chops in the show is by far Sakura Hane, voiced by the highly talented Ueda Reina. Her portrayal of Hane as this absolutely dorky, cheeky, simple-minded, childlike dunce of a character drove me to intense elongated bouts of teary-eyed gut-busting laughter that is hard to top save for the likes of Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. Man, I sure haven't laughed this hard in ages!Sound Design Rating: 9~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Like I've briefly described at the end of my POFITs on the show's sound design, the characters of this show are absolutely absurd and ridiculous with varied personalities. I've already described Hane just now, but what about the rest? Well, there's:1) Amano Onsa, who serves as your average, friendly teenage girl who's a little quirky with a deep passion for bikes and a good sense of humor. She switches from reacting to initiating jokes in a variety of ways2) Suzunoki Rin, who's a smug, easily embarrased yet spunky girl with an elevated sense of self and a sore loser, in addition to being a diehard fangirl of Suzuki's bikes. She's a daddy's girl but has over time lost some respect for him due to his bike-related hijinks3) Minowa Hijiri is your eccentric, air-headed rich kid who fantasizes about doing the 'naughty', 'socially transgressive' things that 'delinquents' tend to do or at least that's the impression that she has in her head. She's frequently accompanied by her butler Hayakawa who rides a Ducati4) Kawasaki Raimu is an enigma of a figure who's utilized by the plot as a conduit for bizarre, unexplainable acts. No one knows what's underneath her helmet and she never speaks. She's a parody of The Stig from Top GearApart from those 5 main ones, there's a host of other side characters as well, in addition to one who we're later introduced to before finally being bumped up to main character status- just like K-ON! Tee-hee!Characters Rating: 8~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To sum all of this up, I just simply couldn't get enough of Bakuon!! and waited extremely eagerly each week to know just what kinda shit that the cast are gonna get themselves into the next time. Not to mention those nights when I simply couldn't sleep at all, laughing my ass off just thinking about all the absolutely hilarious situations and dialogue that occurred throughout the day's episode. Without a doubt, this show was easily my most favorite show of Spring 2016 and I wonder in excitement as to whether something similar to this BUT WITH CARS would get animated one day.

Oh plenty really, anything from traffic laws to business practices- not to mention the characters themselves whom are all relatively quirky, downright bizarre and completely ridiculous at times.The script is also relatively well paced and imaginative, wherein it's loaded to the brim with various situations where >70% of which is outright designed to be soaked in comedic value.

Generally speaking, the show is decently made. The art is well-drawn, and while the colors can be slightly over-saturated at times, they are at the very least rich, vibrant and 'poppy'. The designs of the backgrounds and characters on the other hand aren't meant to break new ground, but are at least creative and distinctive. There're also plenty of real-life visual references in the form of scanned magazines, posters, photographs and artwork.Animation-wise, this show is surprisingly well-animated at parts, especially when it comes down to the character movements and comedic scenes.

What more can I say?In short, this anime is a good time if you're looking to blow off steam or need a smile.  A solid 8/10"", '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)I’ve never ridden a motorcycle, but I used to ride my bike around my neighborhood as a kid.The bike was a hand-me-down from my cousin. It had a glossy green metallic frame. The back wheels had these extra spokes to let someone else stand on (or for grinding rails should one be skilled enough). And it made a nice clicking noise as I rode it down the sidewalk. It was a cool bike which, by proxy, made me cool, too (which is pretty hard to do).While I liked that bike very much (and maybe because...of it), I’ve always wanted to try riding a motorcycle. And as the girls of Bakuon!! prove, motorcycles are more than just glorified bicycles.STORYBakuon begins with Hane, a happy girl who is eager to start her high-school life. However, riding a dinky bike up the hill to her school is more taxing than she realized. But when she sees a passing motorcycle, she knows what she will do: ride them.For Bakuon, motorcycles are its bones, blood, and organs. They are what the anime focuses on in regards to its slice-of-life escapades, its comedy, and its more sentimental material.On the slice-of-life side, the anime takes its time in explaining the different types of motorcycles. A Honda CV400 Super Four, a Yamaha TZR250, and a Suzuki Katana 400 are just a few of the bikes showcased. Everything from their make, their origins, and their overall feel come into play. The amount of information does not make one become a biker-know-it-all, but the audience still gets educated quite a bit in the ways of the two-wheeler.But they don’t just explain their bikes. Hane and the other girls (perhaps obviously) use them for a variety of circumstances. They take part in a daring duel involving a ledge and a river. They embark on a road tour. They race one another during a cultural festival. Nothing extravagant, but, then again, biking isn’t either.On the comedic side, Bakuon has not just a surprising amount of jokes in store but also some cleverness here and there. For example, in episode nine, Hane introduces all the bikes for that previously mentioned race. One of the students comments about Hane’s overly safe-conscious motorcycle, calling it “intellectual, like a satire on modern society.” Hane’s response?“What’s a satire?”The show has more than just “unintentional” humor. It goes unrealistic with a virus that forces Onsa to (gasp) like Suzuki bikes. It uses extreme juxtaposition with a gruff biker dude who hates only two things in the entire world: murder and standing next to a mid-sized Katana. It has silliness when their teacher licks the feet of Hijiri.While the laughs themselves are almost always very light in nature and impact, they do a nice job of providing a mixture of different forms.On the sentimental side, the anime is surprisingly sincere. About once per episode, the narrative takes some time away from the slice-of-life silliness and the bike-related jokes to craft a small scene that is more than heartfelt in nature.One of the best examples of this idea happens in episode five. Onsa (who is usually the starter of these scenes due to her personality) stops Hane from wanting to ride in Hokkaido for one last time. She does not do so because she fears Hane will get hurt or even that she does not think Hane has the capability to ride well.Instead, she simply tells her that, while they had immeasurable fun on their trip, it is time to go back, to realize that (and using a cliché because clichés are awesome) all good things must come to an end.People face this same feeling all the time. When visiting grandma, when going to that movie theater, or when taking part in a cross-country motorcycle journey. Nobody doubts those are fun experiences, but, eventually, the fun will stop for now. That’s just how life is, for, in a similar fashion, that same sense of fun will eventually come around again – as the girls of Bakuon show.These three pillars – motorcycles, comedy, and sincerity – support the anime’s strongest ideal: that it is more than okay to like something “foolish.”The girls often talk about the problems associated with biking. When it’s cold, the freezing air numbs their hands. Motorcycles require heavy maintenance to function properly. A lot of effort is needed to obtain a license. Certain designs are favored over others. Bikes are prone to new types of accidents.Yet that means nothing to what one can get out of this “foolish” hobby. A new way to roam the world. A set of scenarios unable to be felt in any other fashion. A group of friends who not only share a common interest but also share a tight bond between each other.So, when the gang is dancing up on stage and singing a song to recruit new members, or when Hane goes through the motions on her imaginary bike, the audience empathizes with the girls’ joy and their sadness because the audience, too, likes foolishness.It may not necessarily be with motorcycles. But it’s easy to understand why being a “fool” is more fun than not.ANIMATIONArguably speaking, Bakuon’s worst aspects are its art and its animation.The art itself is, at times, not that appealing. Even disregarding the unimaginative locales – the clubroom, random sides of the road, and a bike shop – the show has trouble on a more technical level. Characters can appear wonky, their lines rough and their faces distorted.CG segments exist that, while not off-putting, are not exactly welcome. They are almost exclusively there for the more intensive movements – such as Hane turning a corner on her bike or Raimu falling through the sky on her scooter – so, even if those segments are considered a distraction, they are only so for a small amount of time.Unfortunately, actual animation follows in the same tire tracks, though, to be fair, it does swerve off the path now and again.Usually, the show does not have much in the way character movement. Arms, eyes, and general body actions are not given a lot of attention. However, the girls riding on their motorcycles, with hair flapping and wheels spinning, prevents this anime about moving vehicles from keeping its kickstand in place.As for the character designs, they, like the actual animation, are more subpar than not.Onsa and Hijiri are on the lower end. Onsa’s frizzy hair is part of her personality, but it looks more like a big ball of wet fur plopped on her head. And Hijiri may have long purple hair and glasses, but her design is overly dull.Hane is arguably the same, but she’s purposefully so (as the main protagonist) and she at least has cute hair clips (in the shape of wings).It also doesn’t help that (for everyone) their glossiness is tuned a bit too high, their colorings are somewhat faint, and the school outfits they all wear are too plain to remember.Regardless, Raimu, Chisame, and Rin are easily a hit. Raimu’s helmet fits her literally-say-nothing persona. Chisame’s short stature is used for both characterization and development. And Rin’s tight, pink motorcycle suit, blonde twin tails, and large bust make her out to be an attractive character.(A small nod goes to both the ED visuals with their paper-cut-out characters and some of the citizens in the anime with their red-and-white fox masks.)CHARACTERSThe cast of Bakuon are a quirky bunch despite the realistic setting of the show.Hijiri comes from a wealthy family. She has a personal butler drive her around in her Ducati (of which she owns many). Should her motorcycle become unusable for whatever reason, she simply has another one delivered via a helicopter drop. And she apparently has the capacity to fund scientists to create a device that cools down the engines that pass over them.But her most prominent personality trait is her penchant for being a delinquent. Due to her upbringing, Hijiri finds immense pleasure in doing delinquent-like acts or even just hearing about them. Driving super late at night to go to a restaurant to eat food. Owning a fake motorcycle license. Seeing Onsa and Rin “fighting.” She may not actually be a delinquent, but it’s practically her middle name.Chisame arrives much later in the season (technically episode seven but officially episode nine), and she is considered a side character for this reason, but she quickly demonstrates that she is as important as the other girls.She tends to be less optimistic than most, and she does not like to be seen in a negative light. She also happens to be an undefeated minibike champion, taking after her father’s impressive skill on the race track.Like Hijiri, though, Chisame has a trait that overshadows (maybe, in this case, undershadows) her others: shortness. Growing up, she never could reach the ground with her feet while riding a larger motorcycle, turning her off from the bigger bikes altogether. Her inability to do so fueled not only her determination to be the best at minibike races but also her fear of associating with proper motorcycles (as well as memorizing the multitude of seat heights for bikes out there).The rest of the girls can be described in a similar manner: normal trait juxtaposed with a weird quirk. Raimu is older and the best motorcyclist ever, yet she never speaks a single word (and doesn’t even have a VA listed next to her name). Onsa likes to joke around, but she’s often the one who brings about the next philosophical musing. Rin can be mean at times since her fervent love of Suzuki bikes often dictates her actions.Hane is the same. She’s a simple, kind girl who is oddly cheerful. Nay, incredibly jubilant. She almost always seems to be smiling, viewing life with more positivity than necessary. As such, her personality is affable to say the least.To put it differently, the girls of Bakuon are each foolish in their own respective way. But that foolishness does not exist just to define them. Indeed, it allows them to both grow as characters and affect the other girls in the group.Hijiri’s foolish delinquent behavior allows the group to experience new events. Chisame’s foolish view of herself leads her to earn a motorcycle license. Raimu’s foolish silence allows her to guide the other girls. Onsa’s foolish outlooks let the others understand different angles to approach life. Rin’s foolish passion for Suzuki fuels the passion for the other girls. And Hane’s foolish happiness gives her the strength to cycle forward no matter what may be trying to stop her.Yes, the characters were not all that engaging. But it was nice to see them connected back to that sense of foolishness that the story itself touted from beginning to end.SOUNDBakuon’s opening track combines bass, piano, and lots of drums to create a piece that feels as though one were touring the countryside on motorcycles with a group of friends. The vocalist does well, and the ending guitar riff is catchy, but most of the piece is not too adventurous in terms of scope or even finesse.The ending track, in comparison, does a lot better. The different characters sing individually and together throughout the parts of the song. Onomatopoeia adds a bit of extra cuteness. Shifts in the lyrical pacing change up the flow. The starting guitar is a catchy lead-in. And the quickness of the piece give it higher energy (in contrast to the OP). It’s a nice ED – both on its own and in conjunction with Bakuon.Voice-acting performances are of a similar quality to the ED. Reina Ueda as Hane does a splendid job of acting happy. Nao Touyama as Rin brings the passion. And Yumi Uchiyama as Onsa did well with a slightly mature voice to fit the slightly mature girl.As for the other tracks from the original soundtrack, they do well. Lots of piano pieces – on both the low and high end – for the silly times and the bittersweet times, as well as daintier woodwind pieces for the laidback and fast-paced moments. (“Oyaoya!!” is especially fun.) Also, all that guitar. Tracks like “Kinpaku!!”, “Bushitsu!!”, and “Bakubaku!!” bring, like riding a motorcycle, lots of cool, tough vibes.It may seem like standard slice-of-life fair for this fairly slice-of-life show, but the various compositions, tones, and motifs, combined with the large quantity of music itself, make the OST a more-than-strong offering.ENJOYMENTI had a lot of fun with this one.One of the best jokes from the entire season was when Hane met Jesus. Him responding to her “Thank God” comment, and His revelation that motorcycles were around way back when had me laughing hard.But it wasn’t just this example; I found myself laughing at many other points. Hijiri using training wheels on her motorcycle, blurred out symbols on the motorbike to avoid copyright infringement, and Onsa (with Raimu) poking fun at the Suzuki brand of bikes each got me smiling.Though my favorite parts of the show were Rin and Hane.Rin’s more tsundere tendencies were a welcome sight. As was her running gag with a semi-jerk dad, her calling the smaller-sized Katana users losers, and her overzealous nature in general made her quite likable.While Rin ekes out the win as my favorite character in the show (just barely so), Hane was always making me smile, too. Mostly because she’s simply a very happy, very fun person.She was worried that Yume would yell at her if she lied to Rin about Rin’s Suzuki. Her goofball impersonation of a motorcycle: “Vroom! Put, put, put.” The enthusiastic conversations she had with Baita the talking bike. Her happiness rubbed off on me, making the anime an even more entertaining experience overall.In all honesty, this anime is nothing too special. It does not drive for anything unique or arguably memorable. It does not have the strongest cast imaginable. And it does not have anything overly interesting. But I had fun without a doubt.Bakuon!! may hit a few bumps in the road, but that doesn’t stop it from reaching its destination. Its theme on foolishness makes those sharp turns. Its sound-work gets over those hills. And its likable cast and silly jokes stop it from taking too many detours. All in all, it would make for quite the metallic hand-me-down.SUMMARYStory: Great, motorcycles, comedy, and sincerity support the idea that “foolishness” has its problems, but the rewards are far granderAnimation: Bad, boring artistic direction, below average actual animation, and slightly below average character designsCharacters: Fine, while Hane, Rin, Onsa, Raimu, Chisame, and Hijiri are not much more than their base characteristics, their continued theme on foolishness makes them more thematically relevantSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, good OST, good VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, it’s nothing special, but it’s a fun-filled, happy time nonethelessFinal Score: 6/10 of it), I’ve always wanted to try riding a motorcycle. And as the girls of Bakuon!! prove, motorcycles are more than just glorified bicycles.STORYBakuon begins with Hane, a happy girl who is eager to start her high-school life. However, riding a dinky bike up the hill to her school is more taxing than she realized. But when she sees a passing motorcycle, she knows what she will do: ride them.For Bakuon, motorcycles are its bones, blood, and organs. They are what the anime focuses on in regards to its slice-of-life escapades, its comedy, and its more sentimental material.On the slice-of-life side, the anime takes its time in explaining the different types of motorcycles. A Honda CV400 Super Four, a Yamaha TZR250, and a Suzuki Katana 400 are just a few of the bikes showcased. Everything from their make, their origins, and their overall feel come into play. The amount of information does not make one become a biker-know-it-all, but the audience still gets educated quite a bit in the ways of the two-wheeler.But they don’t just explain their bikes. Hane and the other girls (perhaps obviously) use them for a variety of circumstances. They take part in a daring duel involving a ledge and a river. They embark on a road tour. They race one another during a cultural festival. Nothing extravagant, but, then again, biking isn’t either.On the comedic side, Bakuon has not just a surprising amount of jokes in store but also some cleverness here and there. For example, in episode nine, Hane introduces all the bikes for that previously mentioned race. One of the students comments about Hane’s overly safe-conscious motorcycle, calling it “intellectual, like a satire on modern society.” Hane’s response?“What’s a satire?”The show has more than just “unintentional” humor. It goes unrealistic with a virus that forces Onsa to (gasp) like Suzuki bikes. It uses extreme juxtaposition with a gruff biker dude who hates only two things in the entire world: murder and standing next to a mid-sized Katana. It has silliness when their teacher licks the feet of Hijiri.While the laughs themselves are almost always very light in nature and impact, they do a nice job of providing a mixture of different forms.On the sentimental side, the anime is surprisingly sincere. About once per episode, the narrative takes some time away from the slice-of-life silliness and the bike-related jokes to craft a small scene that is more than heartfelt in nature.One of the best examples of this idea happens in episode five. Onsa (who is usually the starter of these scenes due to her personality) stops Hane from wanting to ride in Hokkaido for one last time. She does not do so because she fears Hane will get hurt or even that she does not think Hane has the capability to ride well.Instead, she simply tells her that, while they had immeasurable fun on their trip, it is time to go back, to realize that (and using a cliché because clichés are awesome) all good things must come to an end.People face this same feeling all the time. When visiting grandma, when going to that movie theater, or when taking part in a cross-country motorcycle journey. Nobody doubts those are fun experiences, but, eventually, the fun will stop for now. That’s just how life is, for, in a similar fashion, that same sense of fun will eventually come around again – as the girls of Bakuon show.These three pillars – motorcycles, comedy, and sincerity – support the anime’s strongest ideal: that it is more than okay to like something “foolish.”The girls often talk about the problems associated with biking. When it’s cold, the freezing air numbs their hands. Motorcycles require heavy maintenance to function properly. A lot of effort is needed to obtain a license. Certain designs are favored over others. Bikes are prone to new types of accidents.Yet that means nothing to what one can get out of this “foolish” hobby. A new way to roam the world. A set of scenarios unable to be felt in any other fashion. A group of friends who not only share a common interest but also share a tight bond between each other.So, when the gang is dancing up on stage and singing a song to recruit new members, or when Hane goes through the motions on her imaginary bike, the audience empathizes with the girls’ joy and their sadness because the audience, too, likes foolishness.It may not necessarily be with motorcycles. But it’s easy to understand why being a “fool” is more fun than not.ANIMATIONArguably speaking, Bakuon’s worst aspects are its art and its animation.The art itself is, at times, not that appealing. Even disregarding the unimaginative locales – the clubroom, random sides of the road, and a bike shop – the show has trouble on a more technical level. Characters can appear wonky, their lines rough and their faces distorted.CG segments exist that, while not off-putting, are not exactly welcome. They are almost exclusively there for the more intensive movements – such as Hane turning a corner on her bike or Raimu falling through the sky on her scooter – so, even if those segments are considered a distraction, they are only so for a small amount of time.Unfortunately, actual animation follows in the same tire tracks, though, to be fair, it does swerve off the path now and again.Usually, the show does not have much in the way character movement. Arms, eyes, and general body actions are not given a lot of attention. However, the girls riding on their motorcycles, with hair flapping and wheels spinning, prevents this anime about moving vehicles from keeping its kickstand in place.As for the character designs, they, like the actual animation, are more subpar than not.Onsa and Hijiri are on the lower end. Onsa’s frizzy hair is part of her personality, but it looks more like a big ball of wet fur plopped on her head. And Hijiri may have long purple hair and glasses, but her design is overly dull.Hane is arguably the same, but she’s purposefully so (as the main protagonist) and she at least has cute hair clips (in the shape of wings).It also doesn’t help that (for everyone) their glossiness is tuned a bit too high, their colorings are somewhat faint, and the school outfits they all wear are too plain to remember.Regardless, Raimu, Chisame, and Rin are easily a hit. Raimu’s helmet fits her literally-say-nothing persona. Chisame’s short stature is used for both characterization and development. And Rin’s tight, pink motorcycle suit, blonde twin tails, and large bust make her out to be an attractive character.(A small nod goes to both the ED visuals with their paper-cut-out characters and some of the citizens in the anime with their red-and-white fox masks.)CHARACTERSThe cast of Bakuon are a quirky bunch despite the realistic setting of the show.Hijiri comes from a wealthy family. She has a personal butler drive her around in her Ducati (of which she owns many).

Cute girls doing cute things.  Boring!  I agree, such shows can indeed be tedious, but not this one.  This one actually has depth to its humour, which makes the world of difference.Bakuon doesn't just focus on the cute girls, it actually goes into great detail about the ways of motorcycle enthusiasts.  It mocks a bikers love of their own bike over that of all others, yet at the same time embraces how wonderful it feels to have that love.  It explores both the upside and the downside of motorcycle ownership without prejudice.  That honesty makes...the whole thing relatable; even to those of us who have no interest in bikes.  And that's an essential ingredient for any comedy to work.  And what great comedy it was.There are no cheap laughs here.  The jokes are extremely well thought out and it had me in stitches at times.  The relentless mocking of Ducati for their lack of reliability; the shameless behaviour of dodgy backstreet dealers and garages; the delusions of Suzuki owners; these are all very real things, parodied beautifully.  Yes, it has some ecchi moments, but who really cares as long as the comedy element makes you laugh?  I certainly don't.  I loved every minute of it.  The characters worked really together.  Their rivalries and friendships were excellently portrayed.  All great comedies need a degree of reality and seriousness or the jokes just aren't funny.  Not all writers manage to strike that balance, but the creator of this one got it spot on.  10/10 from me. A joy to watch. the whole thing relatable; even to those of us who have no interest in bikes.  And that's an essential ingredient for any comedy to work.

', ""The few episodes I watched were fine, this is the life of a teenage girl in Japan who can not only teleport, but can sense when someone needs help and apparently has telekinesis. Sometimes it's dramatic, sometimes it normal stuff, sometimes it comedy. I have nothing against the old style, and simple art. My objection to this series is the fact that the father in this anime paints pictures of his daughter nude, she's only 16, there is something wrong with a father that does that, also those nude pictures of Mami keep popping up here and there. Those things are what disturbs me, although...they might not disturb others. That sort of thing might be acceptable in 1987 Japan, but I don't like it. I think it hints at something about the writers and animators.

Danchigai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30127/Danchigai,"['It can be tempting at times to infer things about the creator of a work from the thing that they have made. The temptation, even the allure, to think that watching/reading/viewing something not only leads us to an understanding of the subject itself, but also gives us a window into the mind of the person or persons responsible for it\'s creation. Having watched  Danchigai, I find myself thinking that creator Kazusa Yoneda must be an only child, because only someone without siblings would imagine it being like this.Danchigai is a short family sitcom that centres on the goings on of the Nakano siblings, who...we find living together while their parents are conveniently working overseas. Each episode sees our protagonist Haruki, an otaku much like you, the viewer, caught up in some sort of shinanigens with at least one of his four sisters: Mutsuki, the older & perfect in every way one; Yayoi, the energetic & quick to anger one; & the ""adorable"" twins Uzuki & Satsuki. They laugh. They cry. They do the things siblings surely do. & because this is anime, those things include:IIIIINNNNNNCCCCCEEEEEESSSSSTTTTT!!!!!Well, implied incest. The kind that every lonely otaku with an ""innocent"" sister fetish imagines. As happens in pretty much every anime involving teenagers, we get the usual mix of innocent misunderstandings & tender/romantic moments, only given an incestuous edge due to the familial nature of our characters. Haruki falls ontop of his sister? Check! Haruki walks in on his sisters having a bikini party? Check! Haruki gets his head caught in a sister\'s cleavage? Double check! Mutsuki tries to practice her first kiss with Haruki? Che....wait no that one is narrowly avoided after two uncomfortable minutes of buildup.As someone who has siblings, I don\'t get this side of anime & Japanese fetish culture in general. This combination of a single child\'s fantasy of a large family with a pervert\'s fantasy of diddling their siblings is something that just doesn\'t do it for me. The Nakano\'s relationship is one of those idealised, all the ladies love their onii-chan types that I do not understand or recognize. Given the age range of the female siblings, Danchigai gets to give Haruki the full otaku fantasy package of being a nerd whose also a great brother, father & possibly lover whose sisters adore him, even if they don\'t always show it openly.The only time a recognizable family occurrence happened was during one episode where Uzuki purposely doesn\'t sit in her usual place around the dinner table, causing Haruki to be confused & anxious about what this upsetting of normality could mean. Little things like that are what should be the heart of family sitcoms like this, not the tedious repetition of pratfalls, camera closeups on boobs & I love my big brother stuff. When the episodes focus on the twins, Danchigai almost gets the right tone. But there always has to be something sleazy, leery or just plain stupid to ruin it.It doesn\'t help that despite the age range of the female siblings, there really isn\'t anything personality-wise to distinguish them from the usual cute girl lineup you get in any school club or classroom comedy. Uzuki & Satsuki look the part, but their personalities could pretty easily be put into the bodies of their older selves & you wouldn\'t really notice. They\'re not like Rin in Usagi Drop or the kids in Strawberry Marshmallow who seem like, you know, kids. The relationship between all the girls & Haruki could likewise apply to pretty much any setting. Too little happens to give the show that sense of being about an actual family, rather than, for instance, a group of friends who kind of act like one.It\'s not that I don\'t get the appeal of seeing a fictionalised version of either your family or the family you didn\'t have. It makes the comedy that much more relatable, in theory, when its at least partly recognizable in your own life. & sure, it\'s a nice idea that your siblings see you playing MMOs & watching anime & don\'t give you a disappointed look before going back to their much more successful lives...oh God what am I doing with my life?! we find living together while their parents are conveniently working overseas.

Haruki falls ontop of his sister? Check! Haruki walks in on his sisters having a bikini party? Check! Haruki gets his head caught in a sister\'s cleavage? Double check! Mutsuki tries to practice her first kiss with Haruki? Che....wait no that one is narrowly avoided after two uncomfortable minutes of buildup.As someone who has siblings, I don\'t get this side of anime & Japanese fetish culture in general. This combination of a single child\'s fantasy of a large family with a pervert\'s fantasy of diddling their siblings is something that just doesn\'t do it for me. The Nakano\'s relationship is one of those idealised, all the ladies love their onii-chan types that I do not understand or recognize. Given the age range of the female siblings, Danchigai gets to give Haruki the full otaku fantasy package of being a nerd whose also a great brother, father & possibly lover whose sisters adore him, even if they don\'t always show it openly.The only time a recognizable family occurrence happened was during one episode where Uzuki purposely doesn\'t sit in her usual place around the dinner table, causing Haruki to be confused & anxious about what this upsetting of normality could mean. Little things like that are what should be the heart of family sitcoms like this, not the tedious repetition of pratfalls, camera closeups on boobs & I love my big brother stuff. When the episodes focus on the twins, Danchigai almost gets the right tone. But there always has to be something sleazy, leery or just plain stupid to ruin it.It doesn\'t help that despite the age range of the female siblings, there really isn\'t anything personality-wise to distinguish them from the usual cute girl lineup you get in any school club or classroom comedy. Uzuki & Satsuki look the part, but their personalities could pretty easily be put into the bodies of their older selves & you wouldn\'t really notice. They\'re not like Rin in Usagi Drop or the kids in Strawberry Marshmallow who seem like, you know, kids. The relationship between all the girls & Haruki could likewise apply to pretty much any setting. Too little happens to give the show that sense of being about an actual family, rather than, for instance, a group of friends who kind of act like one.It\'s not that I don\'t get the appeal of seeing a fictionalised version of either your family or the family you didn\'t have. It makes the comedy that much more relatable, in theory, when its at least partly recognizable in your own life. & sure, it\'s a nice idea that your siblings see you playing MMOs & watching anime & don\'t give you a disappointed look before going back to their much more successful lives...oh God what am I doing with my life?!', 'Anime shorts are a very odd kind of anime format.  Usually ten minutes or less in length, anime shorts usually try to just give you a little something for the little time that they have.  So, for the three minute Danchigai, what kind of a story do we have here?Story: Danchigai is very straightforward.  In a small apartment, there are five siblings.  One brother and four sisters.  This is their daily life.As an anime short, Danchigai doesn\'t have any kind of ""deep"" story or anything.  With each episode coming at a whopping length of 3.5 minutes, the...show acts similar to a 4-koma manga, as each episode follows the same kind of format.  There\'s the set up, where it tells you what these characters are doing, the problem, which is the situation that the episode is about, the climax, where something like a twist occurs, and the resolution where the whole story ends.In all seriousness, this short really doesn\'t have much to offer.  With its absurdly short 3 minute runtime, Dachingai both doesn\'t create any sort of interesting story, and doesn\'t have anything to offer because its ministories are really forgettable.Characters: The characters just comprise of the five siblings.  Haruki, the only boy in the family, and his four sisters Mutsuki, the only one older than him, Yayoi, the tsundere one who totally doesn\'t show brocon feelings at the start, and the twins Uzuki and Satsuki.  Every one of them are one-note characters that don\'t really have any sort of development.  They\'re very simple and not hard to remember while watching, but they don\'t really have much value to them.Art: Danchigai is drawn in a moe artstyle with lots of bright colors and a very colorful appearance.  It\'s really standard, and there\'s not really much to say about it.Sound: The sound is basically nonexistent.  There really isn\'t any music in this entire short, so don\'t expect any.Personal Enjoyment:  Danchigai is...meh.  It\'s essentially a timewaster and the entire series can be watched in less than an hour.  (Hell, this review probably took longer to write than the entire viewing of the whole series.)  If you have some time to kill, and you really don\'t want to be fully invested in ANYTHING at all, then I guess you can watch this.  If you have better things to do or better shows to watch, then considering this probably wouldn\'t be worth your time. show acts similar to a 4-koma manga, as each episode follows the same kind of format.

I chose a short anime and easy to review to practise it.)Danchigai is a short-type anime released in 2015 by studio ""Creators in Pack"".Nothing incredible, but the 3-minute duration of the series is more than pleasant and not too boring. The anime presents the classic stereotypes of this genre, however it is not irritating and too repetitive.Let\'s see what this series offers usStory: 6Nothing incredible, the story is based on 4 sisters, two older and two younger, and a brother, where all live in the same house.Each episode has some gags, some interesting, others less so.However, as mentioned...above, the duration of each episode allows the series not to be not too repetitive and boring.Art: 7-Not too bad to be honest. Sometimes i see some short-anime with a questionable art apparatus, but this is not the case. Animations are not bad at all, even if they are not at all articulated. Notable also the choice of colors, very apt and pleasant.Sound: 6Well, there is not too much to evaluate. There are 4 different ending versions, quite nice, but nothing more, and the background songs are pleasant during the episode.Character: 6+The key part of this series. Obviously every protagonist has a totally different character from the others, mirroring himself in different other characters seen in other series. From the older sister, who pretends to be a good person in front of her sisters and instead shows her true lazy and unkempt nature only when she is with her brother; to the second sister, the classic tsundere, to conclude with the last two, with a totally opposite character: one more frantic, the other calmer.The brother, obviously, must try to contain all 4, with a calm and kind character.Enjoyment: 63 minutes are more than enough for this type of anime. Not boring, not incredible, just relaxing.Overall: 6+Danchigai is a series that does not claim too much.

Some are genuinely funny and utilize their time well. Others are complete shit (coughPupacough). Danchigai is somewhere in the middle.Story (4/10): The show is essentially about the Nakano family, with eldest daughter, only son, middle daughter, and twin little sisters living in their apartment. ...that's really it. It's basically just a snapshot of their lives and hi-jinks sometimes ensues.  There are some 'plot points' (ugh) that come up, but nothing that would give you the idea that there's any kind of story.Animation (5/10): Meh. Everyone is on model, but the designs are generically nice....I have no idea why the twins have pink and purple hair, but whatever.  The backgrounds are actually the better part of the animation, somehow. I think the design of the apartment made it just look and feel like it was the characters home and that there's a whole life there that we don't see.Sound (5/10): I will never understand why there has to be an opening/ending in these shorts. Most are terrible (I've only heard one OP that was actually good), and here is no different. It's cute, but I honestly just skipped it. (Seriously, a 30 second song in an already short episode is just dumb.)Character (4/10): Hello stereotypes! Yeah, that's really all this is: sibling stereotypes.  And while that can work, here it's just 'oh the only boy is slightly pervy like a normal teen would be and lets make fun of him', 'the middle daughter is a TSUNDERE for her brother and beats him up', and 'perfect older sister with like the smallest flaw ever'.  The twins are at least mildly entertaining, but that's only if you can stand little kid characters. And there are literally no other characters, so don't hope for any kind of interaction other than family.Enjoyment (5/10): This show is boring as all balls, but it isn't horrible, I guess. Comedy is subjective to everyone, and there are some funny moments here and there (probably the best is actually centered around the twins and the 'pool' episode), but otherwise it's pretty bland.  There are better slice-of-life shows out there that you can watch. If you want to watch this anyways, it's only about a total half hour, so it's mercifully short.Danchigai isn't going to win any kind of award or even recognition. It's an average mini-series that, while boring, has a few laughs and cute moments to it.  I wouldn't say skip it, but I won't say give it a watch. If you have a half hour to spare, then just blaze through it.  But just know that there are better short series out there to enjoy.

She will definitely beat you up if she catches you.I love this anime. It's so cute. Satsuki looks almost like Renge from Non Non Biyori.I one little sister and if I were to compare to some in this anime it would definitely be Yayoi, because my little sister is athletic and she tries to be me up every now and then.This anime is does really have a plot, but it is based off of 5 sibling, 4 girls and one boy, and their daily lifes. It is...you basic slice-of-life 3 minutes episode anime.The art is basic with a little bit of pop here and there.You have to love all of the characters. Especially Saksuki. I wish my little was like her. you basic slice-of-life 3 minutes episode anime.The art is basic with a little bit of pop here and there.You have to love all of the characters. Especially Saksuki. I wish my little was like her."", 'Story:SoL\'s don\'t really have much story, and when they do, it\'s a drama. Since this is an SoL that limits itself to 3 minutes per episode, drama is thrown out the window for simple comedy. So, is this show funny? It\'s a big ""Ehhh?"" in this department.Comedy is incredibly subjective, but reviews are supposed to be objective, so here I go: The funny parts of this anime are relatable moments between siblings. Having a child make up bizarre stories about her older brother so she can tell her class is funny. Having the older sister ask her younger brother to practice kissing would never happen...in a normal home, and doesn\'t have an iota of relatability to the masses. If it\'s not relatable, it needs to have a punchline. In some regard, there was a punchline for this joke, but knowing how soaked this anime is in incestuous comedy in regards to the elder members of the family, it\'s clear the writer isn\'t self-aware enough to write something funny, rather, implemented this stuff as a self-pleasuring motif and nothing more. He takes pride in the fact that others are getting a little ""hot"" watching his fantasies play out in animated form, and there\'s little to nothing else that is as disgusting as something as that. So, since the reason for its inclusion in this anime isn\'t to be funny, but is, in fact, used for non-physical masturbation, it\'s bad.It\'s a shame, really, since the few episode based on things not related to perversion are hilarious. They don\'t seem childish, and the show doesn\'t have to seem \'adult\' by including such heinous humor. It\'s such a waste. Imagine if this show had a ton of family comedy to it? That would have been great. But alas, we get this schlock. Oh well.Art:Decent enough, but there\'s these weird warping animations that are used rather than actual drawings. It\'s cheap, lazy, and borderline uncanny valley. It\'ll throw you off, no doubt. Not only that, proportions are tossed out the window, especially for sexualized scenes. It\'s ridiculous.Backgrounds look decent and there\'s a good balance of pursuing different angles of the same room as to not come across boring. I appreciate this, but also found it annoying when someone would be expressive and the background would become some trippy visualizer you\'d see in Windows Media Player.Sound:Decent VA work with multiple expressions that were fairly decent. I found a lot of it enjoyable, but, as always, VA work is usually quite decent.Music was forgettable but wasn\'t obstructive. Definitely appreciated this.Character:I felt the two elder sisters were far too unrealistic and the two younger twins to be incredibly good portrayals of young children. They weren\'t ridiculously intelligent, but they were also downright dumb-dumbs on occasion. The episodes where they were the cause of the complicating incident made for the most enjoyable 3-minute segments, and I wish more was used with them considering their characters weren\'t sexually exploited like the two elder sisters who clearly had no character of their own.The brother himself was a moot character with no development but he wasn\'t bothersome either. I felt this was cheap and a way for the creator to either A) self-insert or B) allow the audeince to self-insert. It was likely used for both. This is so stupid.Enjoyment:Decent at best. As mentioned many times before, I found some stuff really great, and other stuff really, really irritating.

It may be a little weird and super short, but it's really fun to watch as a way to unwind.The story is simple: the show is about five siblings-- the classic 'hot and responsible older sister', the 'gamer brother', the 'dumb and hits-everyone sisters', the 'loud twin', and the 'quiet twin'. Nothing out of the blue. Their parents are overseas, so the show is about the five of them and how they get along, basically. The episodes are short, the premise is pretty funny, and if...you like sibling relationships, this could be fun. (Though there are some classic incest references scattered throughout-- but then what can we expect?)The art was pretty good. There are very limited things drawn in, but it was fun and easy to watch. Everything was colorful, and I never zoned out, even if I have a bad habit of doing that while watching shows that are not very action-y.The sound was great! All the voice actors did a good job with their roles, on top of which the closing themes were all pretty fun. The background music did the trick when it needed to, sometimes even adding to the humor.As I mentioned before, there are a few hints at incest. Even though that goes on, I disregarded it because of the sweet stuff that was going on the other half of the time-- stuff about REAL sibling relationships and not romantic ones. There isn't any character development, per say, but some of the characters manage to move past the common stereotypes a create a character for themselves, while others are still just flat.I enjoyed this a lot. And even if you're not sure, just go ahead and try it! It's about about 40 minutes of your life to watch the entire thing-- it's definitely better to at least try.I would recommend this if you: like sibling relationships, might like incesty stuff, like the idea of bigger families, like light comedy, have commitment problems with long animeI would NOT recommend this if you: hate even the idea of incest, want something lengthy or deep or want character development, like overarching plotsHave a great day everyone! you like sibling relationships, this could be fun.

Each episode is about 2 and a half minutes long, so not much goes on in each one. A single event happens, the situational comedy is brought in, and then the event ends, as does the episode. All things considered, the show is good. The comedy isn't great, but I got a few chuckles out of it, and...it's done fairly well given the time frame. Characters are typical anime archetypes, but they're proven formulas and all.If you've got 30 minutes to waste, then Danchigai may in fact be a good way of spending that time. It makes for a fairly decent piece of comedy, but all things considered, it's not going to be one of my favourites, and I don't even remember what brought it to my attention, it seems exactly like on of those shows that would just slip under my radar, and with good reason, there isn't much noteworthy about any of it, but I can't complain. it's done fairly well given the time frame.

They are not given too much attention so it tends to be ignored. Danchigai showed a really promising premise but there wasn't anything special with it.Story: As far as the story goes, it is pretty straightforward. It revolves around the MC Haruki who is the second oldest child who lives with four sisters, Nakano Mutsuki, the oldest, Yayoi Nakano, the third child, and twin sisters Satsuki and Uzuki Nakano. It depicts their lives together and you can tell each character has their own personality.Characters: The characters are mainly the five siblings. Haruki being the only guy in the...family will have to deal with his sister's antics. Mutsuki the eldest acts like a hardworking and serious girl but when in front of Haruki she displays a more lazy and defenseless behavior. Yayoi is a violent-tempered girl(tsundere) who hits Haruki every time something happens. This is something that really irritates me. Why do they still keep using this hitting the guy thing as comedic relief? It really doesn't feel comedic. The twin sisters, just love to play pranks on Haruki and get on his nerves. There was an episode where Haruki realized the twin sisters pranked him and he got mad at them then one of them started to cry and called him stupid because he can't take a prank. I know they're kids but what they're doing is annoying so of course, he will get mad. As for Haruki, there isn't anything special about him cause he doesn't do anything about how he's treated by his sisters. It is almost as if he enjoys getting beaten by Yayoi and getting pranked on. The characters didn't really have much development and there was no value to them.Art: Lost of bright colorsOverall: Danchiagi is a general waste of time. The episodes are only 3 minutes so they can't be watched in less than an hour. The only comedic aspect of this show is Yaypi always beating up Haruki which isn't comedic at all. If this is your cup of tea, then go for it if not then find a better comedic show. family will have to deal with his sister's antics.

I don't feel that I need to review it as much as I do my regular anime's. Its hilarious how cute each of the sisters are and how they each have their own little relationship with the brother. I thoroughly enjoyed this, and wish I had this kind of relationships with sisters. The voice acting and music was cute and adorable.

It shows them messing around at home and showcases the sisters' personalities. It's mildly entertaining at best and hearkens back to shows such as Minami Ke, which was squarely centered on interactions rather than any real plot. In this case, the show is too short to really let the characters grow on you, and there isn't any unifying theme behind all the events. Thus, if you absolutely have nothing to do, you can give this a shot. Otherwise, you should watch other 4-koma pieces such as Dannaken (well themed) or Tonari...no Seki-kun (organized mischief).Animation:The animation quality is actually quite above average for a short 4-koma work with crisp drawings and occasionally nice backgrounds. The style is generally light with a lot of comical scenes and a fairly saturated color palette. The characters are distinguishable from each other though I wouldn't expect any awards for such a short work. There is no action in the work though there is a fair amount of implied ecchi (a lot of girls randomly going into the guys room, including his bed- it does steer clear of the incest though).Sound:There is no OP but, despite the animation not really changing, there are 4 different EDs. All of them are a bit on the light side, and perhaps even a tad childish? Expect only minimal effects and BGM in this work. Other than super-talent Mikako Komatsu, the VA talent isn't anything that special. Given that there are only minimal character backgrounds, the talent wouldn't have mattered too much in the show.Story:Each episode focuses on a random topic such as (humorously) if the twins (that look completely different) are actually twins, or the main protagonist getting a fever and being cared for by his tsundere sister. Each episode is self contained and you could probably watch the episodes in random order with no issues. There isn't any central plot holding things together though the last episode has a tiny bit of conclusion by allowing the gals to express their (platonic) love of their brother.Character:Each of the girls has distinguishable character traits, but there isn't any real character development nor is there really much character background. You either enjoy them as they are or you find something else to watch. I was lukewarm at best.Value:This isn't one of those shows that you'll likely talk about.

The humor is very thin, and it\'s rare that I ever smiled throughout the series. Don\'t expect clever writing either; the series is rife with cliches, such as characters putting food into their mouth and immediately going ""OISHII"" complete with obligatory sparkles, or the older sister seeing her brother and younger sister sprawled on the floor and immediately jumping to conclusions.......What? That last one sounds creepy? Then better stay the hell out of this series, because it sure loves its incestuous overtones: the brother gets all blushy around the onee-san, the high-school imouto gets all blushy around the brother.Don\'t expect high production values, either. The art is nothing to write home about and the music is forgettable. If I\'m to say something positive about this series, it\'s that very occasionally it manages to have cute moments.

If I was a...psychologist i would be looking at the ill-discipline from the lack of parents around and expect them to be reprobated in the future.So sadly for me, it was a worthless pile of trash, that i absolutely hated as was nothing to grip me or make me want to watch.

This show really isn't for everyone, as the average user score probably let on.  The whole thing is in CGI like the poster indicates, and on top of that this show is quite the weird one.  But. I implore you, if you think there's even a chance you can get past those concerns, please give this show a try.  Just a couple episodes.  Because, based on the five episodes I've seen, this is a real diamond in the rough.Most CGI shows...that air each season are either garbage or nothing special.  This is largely due to the relative inexperience of their creators - most are made by newer studios and personnel who just entered the business.  Estab-Life is made by a more experienced crew, and it shows.  It's directed by the same director as GochiUsa, and the script was written by the original creator of Full Metal Panic.  It also has the creator of Code Geass in a planning role.  All this points to quite a bit of promise in this production.Of course, even talented people could make a poor product, but fortunately that's not the case here.  Make what you will of the visuals - what you see on the promotional material is what you're going to get, same with the designs (though I should point out that this CGI is pretty high quality compared to the usual fare).  Even if those leave you unimpressed, however, the real strength of this show lies in the writing and direction, which combine create a show that is, at its core, just really funny and really weird in all the best ways.The writing is as bizarre as the synopsis would have you believe.  It's fairly episodic in nature, with each episode being a new weird-ass adventure.  The scenarios this show delves into are strange and make hardly any sense - and are also endlessly creative.  The writers make good use of these wild situations, making each one quite memorable in its own way.  But it's clearly been written with enough foresight for the plot to still build upon itself - a seemingly throwaway joke in one episode will be referenced and further developed in the next, for example.The characters benefit greatly from this as well.  Even though I rather enjoyed the first episode over all, I left it feeling like most of the characters were one-note.  And while that might be true in a sense, they still have plenty of depth, it just comes from the unique and hilarious ways the characters express their defining traits.Hopefully I highlighted what I found so appealing about this show in this review, and hopefully I convinced you to give it the time of day.  I have it at an 8 currently largely due to how, while I overall quite love this show, must admit that the silliness goes a bit overboard at times, to the point that it's a tad distracting: this, along with the visual issues inherent to fully CGI shows, led me to that score.  However, I'm genuinely considering upping this to a 9 depending on how the rest of this season turns out.

Usually 3Hz would deliver in that regard, but while expecting a show titled ""Healer Girl"" to have guns-blazing action is an exercise in futility, I somehow stumbled upon Estab Life, that has absolutely everything I wanted, and then some.Estab Life is what you would call a ""multi media franchise"", or in less flattering but more accurate terms,...a ""made for mobage"" show. And in my experience, usually failure or high likelihood of failure mobage would generate some of the best original anime out there (see Kotobuki, Akanesasu Shoujo, and of course Kemono Friends). Estab Life is no different. Right out of the bat it is supremely confidant on its premise and themes, and is wildly imaginative in its depiction of the Tokyo clusters. I\'m actually reminded quite a lot of Rolling Girls, though more restricted to a single location and with less drama.And by imaginative, I mean, wow. Communist Penguins, Mahou Shoujo Yakuza, No-pan Theocracy, Prison Horse Races, and much more are featured in this show. And bizzarely they all make sense given the context they are set in (Fucho is famous for its prison and horse races, for example). It never feels jarring nor is there any whiplash when going from episode to episode, part of the joy is seeing what crazy situation the girls will end up in.Equa-senpai is quite possibly my favorite MC of the season. Most of these Cute Girls do Cool Things shows would usually cast either a genki-baka type or a cool-but-silent type as their protagonists, and, while fine enough, are overly played out. Equa\'s personality in being a kind and easy-going onee-san type is wildly out of place, yet a very fresh take for a genre like this, and her interactions with the cast and everyone, as well as having actual shortcomings, makes her an endearing character to follow. The rest of the main cast are pretty good too, though I would have liked if each of them had their own spotlight episodes.It\'s not just fun wacky comedy either, out of all the shows this season, this is the last show I\'d expect to have actual heart in it, but goddammit it does, and the superb direction and music all make you feel emotional in ways I never really got for a show of this type of genre.Special mention to the music. Fujisawa\'s OST, while very similar to most of his own previous works, all complement each moment so effectively and can really make you feel emotional for a scene that is otherwise farcical. Like, it\'s a testament to the entire soundtrack when it can make you feel genuinely sad for one of the characters despite that one predictable tragic event that you know happens actually happen.The whole show has been a wild and fun ride, and I will eagerly await the film (I don\'t know why or how, but thank you Square Enix for funding weirdo projects like these) once it releases stateside.You were the first and last friends I\'ve ever made!8/10 a ""made for mobage"" show.

The rest of the main cast are pretty good too, though I would have liked if each of them had their own spotlight episodes.It\'s not just fun wacky comedy either, out of all the shows this season, this is the last show I\'d expect to have actual heart in it, but goddammit it does, and the superb direction and music all make you feel emotional in ways I never really got for a show of this type of genre.Special mention to the music. Fujisawa\'s OST, while very similar to most of his own previous works, all complement each moment so effectively and can really make you feel emotional for a scene that is otherwise farcical. Like, it\'s a testament to the entire soundtrack when it can make you feel genuinely sad for one of the characters despite that one predictable tragic event that you know happens actually happen.The whole show has been a wild and fun ride, and I will eagerly await the film (I don\'t know why or how, but thank you Square Enix for funding weirdo projects like these) once it releases stateside.You were the first and last friends I\'ve ever made!8/10', ""I feel like the story is a bit repetitive, except episode 7, which is just the main extractors being on the end of making their cafe more populated.The CGI, of the background and characters feel absolutely gorgeous and it almost feels like it isn't. the CGI character arts seems to be done in a way, where it's pleasing to look at and it generally could be simple to draw fanart of the characters.

The score was low 5.78... but three reviews giving it 8/10 piqued my interest, all said it was great and their reviews all rang true to me so I decided I\'d give it a shot. The cover art was colorful and endeared me just looking at it, it was obvious that this pulled no punches in the art department and shortly after watching an episode that was truly made clear. The animation itself it not that great being a 2.5D sort of 3D affair,...but you soon get used to it.. the actual art itself was beautiful, the character designs, the background art.. they look great. The characters themselves are endearing, the story and the voice acting (English in my case) won me over.. I don\'t think I\'ve had an anime make me laugh so much in recent times, this is a very tongue in cheek series, everyone is having fun here and I love it. All I can say is that if you are a ""man of culture"" you will enjoy this. It has style, it has humor it has feels.. color me impressed. THIS truly is an underrated show and I thank Machine_of_Ice, NomineMalum & IdolwhisperTM for bringing it to my attention, you truely are cultured in the way of anime and I salute you for your reviews that fly in the face of public criticism. Now I\'ll go back to watching the show.. 10 episodes in and it\'s still pretty good, unfortunately the whacky humor of earlier episodes hasn\'t carried forward so that\'s unfortunate, I still enjoy watching it. but you soon get used to it.. the actual art itself was beautiful, the character designs, the background art.. they look great.

Oh well.)The closemindedness of not watching something because it's CGI is childish and immature. I enjoyed the so bad it's good content of Tesla Note, and the charm of Rusted Armors. Sure, websites like MAL score this a 5, but who would take MAL scores seriously? Relying on MAL scores is like relying on waves of underage Shonen anime viewers to tell you what to like. Still, no one watched Estab Life. At least, that's what it felt like to me. Though the CGI is choppy and makes some characters look...like they are made out of plastic, this series does have some elements that make it shine, and it managed to connect and be memorable to me. This promotes a gacha game, which worried me, as this did have some issues in the end.The biggest talent of this series is it's absurd and very hilarious comedy. It's over the top, and ridiculous in execution, though it worked wonderfully, and I was laughing nonstop. The last few episodes do get serious, and even though it worked, they didn't come close to the quality of the fun and funny episodic ones. There isn't much plot here anyways.The story is about a cast of loveable characters who help people from different clusters escape their miserable lives. An anime that is actually blatantly about escapism without really trying to give a hopeful message in the end. These clusters are connected by an underground train system and are experiments to see what type of societies work, and which don't. A failed cluster will be completely erased if the population declines. You can expect anthropomorphic dogs, communist penguins, slave laboring prisons, old men wanting to become magical girls, religions were wearing underwear is considered a heresy, and other creative and outrageous ideas such as the cast at some point trying to assassinate a prison ward.Equa is the central member of the cast who was given amazing powers that let her see the future. She is usually in such a good mood it's a bit creepy at times. Martese is a perverted pile of goo that took the shape of a little girl and is completely obsessed with Equa. These are the only two that are ever given development. Other than that, there's Ulla, an anthropomorphic dog that was hilarious given the voice talent of Miki Shinichirou, even though all he does is bark in the series. Alga is a small robot that is cruelly honest and extreme in his ways to the point he's an accidental comedian. Last there is Ferres, a sharp shooter who is often insecure, moody, and shy about it all. A problem with this series is that most of these characters do not get developed at all or explained where they came from or how they came to be. The music is overall forgettable, and the series doesn't do much for me when it deviates from it's clever and outstanding comedy. When the stakes run high, those action packed scenes are often laughable as the cast gets sprayed by bullets that never seem to hit.As a mostly episodic series, there wasn't a single one of those plotless episodes I didn't enjoy because the comedy is that well done. Ironically, it's the plot focused episodes I didn't enjoy too much. There is still a film for this that will come out some day that will be directed and written by Goro Taniguchi of Code Geass fame for those that want more.

That’s not to say that this show doesn’t have its stink to it. The CGI can look a bit janky and the sound design can feel distractingly off, especially in the first couple of episodes, but the production is consistently at a good level, the character models and background elements are all cohesive and the...actual story delivers a wide variety of fun, wacky, escape of the week scenarios accompanied with a jazz soundtrack when the inevitable shoot out starts between the Extractors and the security drones.The Extractors in question are a group of heroines, a samurai dog and a sassy robot who help clients escape their life in a “cluster”, a city made to suit a political, cultural or religious ideal so they can find happiness and build a new life in another cluster.These people can vary from a yakuza boss wanting to flee so he can become the magical girl he has always dreamed of becoming in a cluster dedicated to magical girls or a group of free-speech ballet penguins wanting to escape their communist penguin overseers. The concepts are always a bit too ridiculous, but they never lack creativity.A lot of the concepts of the world aren’t explained all that well, such as how there are talking animals, demi-humans and magic in what is supposed to be post-apocalyptic Japan, but it doesn’t really need to nor did it bother me all that much as a viewer. The Extractor Martese is a demi-human slime with a loud personality whilst Ferres is a level-headed, but easily socially fluster mage gunner. Holding the group together is Equa, an always positive moe blob and leader of the group with her mysterious powers that serve to get them out of trouble in a pinch.As much as I have praised the show I can’t quite say that it’s good. I do like the main characters, but there are times when they can get a bit annoying. Martese in particular attempts to be endearing, but backfires most of the time as she comes off as more of a pest. Some of the episodes in the middle of the season are just plain dull and are skippable which is a shame plus some of the political implications in some episodes are... interesting... I'll leave it at that.I get that there is a stigma over CGI anime, believe me, I get it, but don’t let the MAL 5/10 rating (as of the time of writing) fool you into thinking this show is bad. It’s not. It’s at the very least a silly fun time. It doesn’t take itself too seriously and you'll barely notice any of the stink once you get used to the smell.6/10 It’s Okay *Thumbs Up* actual story delivers a wide variety of fun, wacky, escape of the week scenarios accompanied with a jazz soundtrack when the inevitable shoot out starts between the Extractors and the security drones.The Extractors in question are a group of heroines, a samurai dog and a sassy robot who help clients escape their life in a “cluster”, a city made to suit a political, cultural or religious ideal so they can find happiness and build a new life in another cluster.These people can vary from a yakuza boss wanting to flee so he can become the magical girl he has always dreamed of becoming in a cluster dedicated to magical girls or a group of free-speech ballet penguins wanting to escape their communist penguin overseers.

Masterpiece.This show is f***ing stupid. Like REALLY stupid! Thats 95% of the enjoyment. Its basically about a dystopian Japan that was divided into city states or ""clusters"" each of which has a different government structure and all of which ban citizens from traveling to other clusters. The MC and pals are ""extractors"" who help people start over in a new cluster. With a plot like this they COULD tell a super mature and realistic story about how restricting freedom of movement can cause societal issues and comparing the different governments of the clusters to show the best and worst of society, thankfully...thats not what they did. They took a risk by turning the plot into 1 big joke while still having the characters take it seriously and it worked out very well for the entertainment value of the show.Story: 10/10The plot is interesting on its own regardless of execution. While I adore the direction they went with it it does make me curious what a more serious take on the plot would look like. Episode 3 when Equa was interrogated and they reveal that everything about her is either fabricated or indeterminable that REALLY got me hooked! Whats this girl\'s past and how is it that they weren\'t even able to narrow down whether she is or is not a human (or what she is for that matter). Regardless love the plotCharacters: 100/10The characters are the main draw of this show. I\'m 5 episodes in and every single character thus far has been incredibly likable and interesting in their own ways. Equa is a plank of wood but in a good way. She\'s basically a yes man thrust into the position of a leader and is always needlessly optimistic regardless of whats going on. Martes is a complete psychopath. The reveal that she is a slime was interesting by itself early on, but then episode 4 they reveal ""the congress of Martes"", AKA 100 mini versions of her in conflict over what she does. It was pure lunacy and a very good parody of real life politics. Feles is a magical girl former yakuza and full tsundere, need I say much more? Meanwhile wolf guy is basically Kenny from south park cus he practically dies off early on every episode.Animation: 10/10YES THE ANIMATION IS BAD! THATS WHY ITS SO GOOD! A show like this plain and simple would not work with traditional animation. You can do it but half the impact is this animation style. If the show was actually trying to tell a serious story then yes this animation wouldnt be good but its a slice of life comedy masquerading as a serious story. The animation tells you right off the bat not to take the plot seriously.Music/OP/ED: ?/10I wont give a hard score to the music. The OP and ED are skippable and forgettable and same with the music. It just doesnt stick out as anything good or bad so I dont feel comfortable giving it a score.Voice Acting: 8/10How in gods name did this filler anime get a dub? A descent dub at that. The actors themselves are great, my biggest complaint is that the lip sync can be off at times.Alt Anime Recommendations:OreTwi AKA Ore Twintail Ni Narimasu.

It's one of those shows that on the face of it should be really stupid. The fun kind of stupid, but still, very very dumb. It's the kind of show you can be trying to describe to a friend and realize how ridiculous that sounds on the face of it, only to realize the execution was far more mundane than the setup made it sound. For example the fact that it has a yakuza boss who wants to run...away from crime city and become a magical girl, or the hot spring city where panties are illegal. It throws a bunch of really comedic sounding ideas at the wall, and then executes them like you're going to a business lunch and don't want to stand out too much. All of the potential is there for it to be a crazy high-concept comedy show, but it plays it straight like I'm meant to take any of this seriously.However I found myself enjoying it anyway, if you just embrace the stupid high-concept nature of the world and focus on the character interactions you can have a good time with it. I don't think it's a very memorable show, but if you decide to watch it there are worse ways to spend your time. The 3D animation was decent and not too distracting, I've seen worse. If 3D is a turn-off for you just on the face of it then I guess stay away. Overall I'm feeling a 7/10 away from crime city and become a magical girl, or the hot spring city where panties are illegal.

I would even dare to say this is a hidden diamond that might be completely misjudged because of modern American politics. I will explain what I mean by this.The whole extraction team idea started to be well known during World War 2, with people trying to get the Jewish population to safety and allied pilots back home to fight another day. It didn't matter whether you were male or female, you could be on...one of the teams to counter the Germans. However for the Cold War era this changed to East and West Germany where people wanted to leave East Germany to get to the West Germany side. There are countless famous stories of how people did this. Even by water, air, digging tunnels and by land using various ways. Even to this day it still happens if we look to Ukraine, again the Russians trying to target everyone that tries to flee and poses an easy target.This anime is most likely based on that and it actually did a amazing job at it even if you add in the typical anime additions to spice up the story a bit further. This would actually be a very realistic way of how to perform such extractions, you plan, you do what you need to do and finish the job. I really can't praise Polygon Pictures enough for a job very well done in that respect.Story:-------You get thrown in the deep end with the story never really explaining things until the last episode and only doing so to a very minor level. Which is a shame, but this can't be ignored. Another flaw is that even the episodes are not really explained in enough detail either. This leading to the 'wait, why is this a thing?' and 'why is this happening?'.Yet if you look past that, and keep in mind what I mentioned before regarding how realistic the extraction of people is even in anime style, I think this is a very good story and I really do hope there will be more to come. A new season would be very welcome in my eyes.I did find it rather odd that episode 5 seems to suggest fan service, but doesn't give any really. However with the story and humor added I think it will be well within the acceptable limits. I won't spoil what is happening in this episode, you will have to see for yourself.Graphics:------------While over all it really does look good, you will see it's CGI and specially in the first few episodes where it actually messes up the animations quite badly. This is probably why people don't rate it higher. However later in the episode list this is a pretty rare issue which means the team tried their best to give a amazing show. Which in graphics is actually a treat for the eyes and I can't stress that enough. Yes, CGI for anime is still in the very early stages of development. Every studio that attempts this will need to learn how to apply this properly and let's be fair, with anime you don't really have the same problems as IRL actors and sets. Anime CGI is very much at the starting point and for something to turn out this good, specially the last episode, you need to study hard and try your utmost best to get things done.So yes, you will find bad issues regarding the graphics if it comes to the CGI part. However with a story that is actually this good and characters that are not obnoxious or bad in general I think we need to give it a pass. I do however wish to ask the studio to put things in the oven a little longer so it can mature properly. Finishing touches are really well worth it.Sound:---------The sound is good, however with the mix of CGI you might expect a better idea for sound. Make explosions for example use the bass to really give that blast effect. Really mostly small details that could have been better but are a bit disappointed as it wasn't taken care of properly.Characters:--------------Over all the characters are fairly decent flashed out, however the disappointing part is that the characters don't really get a background story. Except for Equa who seems to get it at the very last episode. And Ferres in one of the early episodes, but in a very vague way. All others seem to be left in the dust even if stated to be 'main characters' which is the disappointing part.Why is Alga, the robot, a selfish stubborn pain in the rear for example?Why is Martese a slime girl and why is it so hard to use her abilities?Why is Uila, the only beast person, on the team and where did he come from?Questions like these do keep popping up in your mind, specially with Alga and Uila not being much use most of the time. At least not in a clear distinct way other then Uila being akatana wielder and seems to be strong, while Alga mostly complains and is selfish without really doing much other then being a hacker.In a larger perspective, the only one that is really powerful throughout the series seems to be Ferres. Martese being only really usable in the last episode near the ending where she suddenly 'found' a hammer that makes her OP. But loses it at the very end.Final word:--------------I actually very much enjoyed this anime and find it disappointing that people rate it so low as it deserves so much more. The story is pretty good, art/graphics is good even with the CGI flaws, characters are decent and this anime gives pleasure in watching it. I would be honored to see more of this anime! one of the teams to counter the Germans.

At least not in a clear distinct way other then Uila being akatana wielder and seems to be strong, while Alga mostly complains and is selfish without really doing much other then being a hacker.In a larger perspective, the only one that is really powerful throughout the series seems to be Ferres. Martese being only really usable in the last episode near the ending where she suddenly 'found' a hammer that makes her OP. But loses it at the very end.Final word:--------------I actually very much enjoyed this anime and find it disappointing that people rate it so low as it deserves so much more. The story is pretty good, art/graphics is good even with the CGI flaws, characters are decent and this anime gives pleasure in watching it. I would be honored to see more of this anime!"", 'Despite the show\'s shortcomings, it is incredibly memorable. I absolutely adore this show. The side characters and the girls in the main cast are awesome and lovable. They do lack depth tho. Also, when you encounter a part of the show which is fleshed out, the show is amazing. However, this can sometimes be the exception plus it is lacking in many parts. For instance; it can be somewhat boring at some parts and the action never makes sense and is only there for plot convenience. This often made me feel like ""why didn\'t they just go in guns ablazing in the first place"".I...don\'t know. It definitely one of a kind. Just wished it was fleshed out a little more.Still I\'ll recommend you give it a try because there isn\'t another show like it 8.5/10 don\'t know. It definitely one of a kind. Just wished it was fleshed out a little more.Still I\'ll recommend you give it a try because there isn\'t another show like it 8.5/10', ""Saying this show subverted my expectations is an understatement. “Then why is it so middle of your list then?” Because I wish it had gotten more episodes, but we will be forever stuck with 12. It’s a shame that this series is largely ignored due to a variety of reasons that almost turned me off from watching it. For starters the show is CG, yikes. But after watching the first episode, I was surprised how decent it looked and how natural it felt. It wasn’t anything bad like Berserk or Ex-Arm, nor was it on a level like HnK or Beastars. Its CG worked very...well for the show it was, it did not detract my enjoyment of the show like I thought it would. Secondly, it’s a Gacha advert. Many anime adaptations of pre-existing or soon to be made gacha games are usually pretty forgettable. Takt.OP from a while ago comes to mind. But once again I didn’t get any impression of an “epic secret cameo” being shoved in my face for the sake of commercializing the upcoming Estab-Life game. And lastly there’s a furry in the main cast. With all those strikes going against it, why do I like it so much?Simply put, it’s fun. Yeah, I know it’s rare to hear someone say that as a legitimate reason for enjoying a show or any form of media these days without forced nuances or a deeper analysis. But truly, I was engaged with the silly action, character interactions, the world and the clusters we’re introduced to. Also the story as well, since we’re given very little to work with in terms of story at the start and it doesn’t start elaborating on the story until much later into the series. But firstly a brief synopsis. We follow Equa, Martes, Felles, Alga, and Ulula, who are extractors. The mission of an extractor is simple, someone does a silly dance as a code for wanting to escape their current life, uploads it to the internet and from then on, it’s up to the extractors to give them an escape into another cluster(world) where they can enjoy life again.A simple concept set in an odd world, or several should I say. Clusters are these areas contained in their own bubble/ecosystem, each have their own unique set of rules, population, and ways of living. Though once you’ve been born into one cluster, it’s impossible to leave yours(prison cluster exempt), that’s where the extractors come in and do just that. Long story short, clusters exist because there came a point where humans could no longer survive and prosper. So they created an AI that birthed a new era of humanity that spliced human living attributes to animals, robots, and everything else in between, each given their own cluster to flourish in. Weird concept, but trust me it works somehow.What makes this show for me is the main trio we follow and how they tackle each situation they’re in. In fact, a good bunch of the issues they run into aren’t a fault of the cluster’s resistance towards extractors, but turmoil they have with each other, or something personal going ary within themselves. Equa is a kind and compassionate leader. Too kind in fact, the creators made her so kind to make it off putting. I think they failed in that regard since I don’t think she was as scary as she was fake. Feles is the straight man, usually the one who’d rather be at home then putting her life on the line extracting others. It’s probably due to her down to earth nature, but she was my favorite. Finally there’s Martes, a slime who takes on the form of a cute girl. She is obsessed with Equa and will lash out at anyone getting too close with her, namely Feles. Her character grew on me, at first she was annoying but after seeing her actually care for Feles-san I too started caring for her as well. Oh, and there’s Alga and Ulala, a robot and a furry respectively. They don’t add too much to the story, but round out the cast. I preferred Alga since his inclusion felt more warranted than Ulala’s, being a robot of course.The show tricked me, not only in managing to be rather enjoyable, but also because of the twists the story takes. I started this series thinking it’d be no more than a cluster/weirdo they have to extract of the week, but about halfway through it shows its true colors. After an episode where they have to extract a preacher from a cluster where you’re not allowed to wear underwear, we see Equa’s emotion dimmer than her usual up-beat self. Odd, we then get an episode of the team handling a situation without Equa, due to an illness that came over her and another one about her cafe that she runs, aka, their HQ. But then we reach the best and most emotionally heavy episode where they have to extract a butler who loathes serving this bratty young girl. And with that episode, I'll just say that I was not expecting these kind of feels from this kind of show. It’s a great episode because we really come across some spectacular character development for the character the episode focuses on.I got into detail about that episode because it exemplifies everything I love about the show. The characters, the world, the unpredictability, and the drama of it all. As for what I didn’t like about the show, well although the CG didn’t bother me personally, I could imagine it being much more successful had it gone 2D. There are moments where we see clones, twins, and reskins. Even the final episode has the master Manager taking on the form of the rich girl (Cindrillion) despite not being her. I chalk this up to artistic merit and don’t knock it for this reason, she’s rather cute anyways. As I mentioned earlier, I felt that Alga and especially Ulala were unnecessary. It doesn’t help that we learn hardly anything about either of them aside from what I’ve already mentioned about them. At least Alga can talk and provide interesting banter with the main trio on occasion, Ulala just grunts and barks. Very forgettable and I’m sure a furry also detracted some viewers from picking it up. The score is nothing to write home about either, and everything else from a presentation standpoint is just serviceable. Though some of the backgrounds and locations are nice to look at, such as the prison or panda clusters.So in short, what makes this series so good is how much it does right despite having so many strikes going against it. I found the characters, situations, designs, story, dialogue, and voice acting all fun to invest my time into. I might just say this is my AOTS, and if this anime has taught me anything, it’s that you should not judge a book by its cover. well for the show it was, it did not detract my enjoyment of the show like I thought it would.

Dragon Ball GT,https://myanimelist.net/anime/225/Dragon_Ball_GT,"['Oh boy, I\'m stepping into unholy ground here!This review will be going into just about every plot hole, very F up, just about everything that is terrible and wrong in DBGT that I can find or remember.*Just so you know, I am a GIGANTIC DBZ FANBOY, and I do know DBZ isn\'t ""perfect"" and yes this review is nothing but a whinny nit-picking troll intended bash fest, so if you hate reading about hate or if you are not familiar with the majority of dragonball and most of the stuff that accurs before GT cause this review will spoil most of the ""plot"" of GT,...then go ahead and click unhelpful *STORY: Sequels, well they usually give justice to the original, or remind you that the original is as good as it gets.Dragonball Z, anime franchise king, the big long winded battle, overrated fail, BEST ANIME EVAR!!, whatever your take on DBZ is, you can not deny it\'s popularity, calling it a household name in Japan (And around the world) is more than an understatement.Probably the best best comparison I can made is: DBZ is like Mario, everyone knows what is it is.And of course one thing always happens when a series becomes popular, a sequel is made.I remember when I found out about Dragonball GT, I went crazy! Fanboying like no tomorrow, but I was young and very easy to impress, and there was a side to me that wished DBZ never ended, and that Goku would continued to beat up baddies and fire Kamehamehas until the cows come home.But enough of that.I watched Funimation\'s version, the one where they skipped the first 20 or so episodes, but that was actually a present in disguise because those episodes were just a laughable gimmacky version of a dragonball search from Dragonball, but instead they\'re looking around the galaxy for the black star dragonballs!Stop, I\'m not going to ask what\'s the difference between these black star dragonballs and the original ones cause I don\'t give a damn, but I want to know why are they there.From how DBGT explains it, the black star dragon balls were an extra set of dragonballs that Kami, the namekian guardian of the earth before dende, made for no apparent reason.Hold on... Wasn\'t the earth destroyed by Kidd Buu? I\'ll explain this F up, you see when Kidd Buu destroyed the earth at the end of DBZ, they had to use the Namekian dragonballs to bring the planet back to normal... but before that, Super Buu destroyed the lookout(Where Popo and Dende live at), where these balls are said to be.If memory serves me right, Dende had to recreate the Dragonballs again cause they got destroyed along with the earth... So no one except Dende could\'ve made them, but it\'s pointed out that Kami made them... Sooooooo yeah, if you look at it this way, DBGT is completely non canon.Next let\'s talk about the first major villian, Baby, who\'s name is impossible to take serious, I mean I laugh every time one of the characters say his name with anger or seriousness.Baby\'s er... Babie\'s (I\'m not sure how to write that) story is that he is the last of the race called the tuffles, and that he seeks revenge against the saiyans...Wait a minute, something like this had already happened, although it was non canon, there was an ova about the last creation of the tuffles trying to get revenge on the saiyans, and said ova was made years before GT.Unoriginality is one thing, but to use the same concept twice shows that there was no creative thought used in the making of this anime.Anyway, after Baby gets his ass whooped twice, he goes to Earth and starts to take control of everybodies minds (Except Hercule, Buu, and Uub... and Piccolo). Mainly Vegeta\'s, and the result of baby taking over his mind? You get the worst named villian of all of Dragonball, Baby Vegeta... probably the least threatening name of a villian next to Buu.Next up the Super 17 saga... which needs to be renamed the Fan Service saga.This is without a doubt the most shallow part of DBGT, premise; all hell breaks loose on earth, literally! And the main characters have to go around the world rekilling their old foes (Except Baby for some reason) even the ones from the movies.Oh my god, once again GT takes a pre existed plot, this time from the DBZ movie Fusion Rebirth, and just switches a few things around like who is fusing into a super fighter, actually both the movie and GT seem to rip off the OVA, cause they all feature villians coming back to life, except the OVA was the one that had the original concept of revived villians for the series.The main villian this time is Android 17, 2 of them actually that fuse together into a super android named, heh, super 17.I\'m tired of naming similiarites between GT and the movies, cause fusing androids had already been used in the DBZ movie, Super Android 13.Usual DBZ plot setups accur, super 17 beats every one to death until Goku arrives and Goku uses a last resort attack to beat him. But before any of that happens, two notable things happen:1. Goku goes to hell and fights Frieza and Cell in a goofy battle, and Goku gets sends sent further down to hell with filler episodes.and 2, An android 17 that already exists on earth (Which is actually canon, because Krillian, after the Cell games saga, wishes android 17 back to life but this part is pretty easy to over look), kills Krillian just to piss off android 18. This part really irritates me alot actually, just piece together what I said in this paragraph, and you\'ll understand.And last but not least, the Evil Dragon saga, which isn\'t that bad actually.While the villians revived on the last saga were on earth, their negative energy corrupted the dragonballs making them crack and when they gathered them together to make a wish, instead of shenron appearing, an evil dragon appears and spreads the dragonballs along with 7 evil dragons around the earth.So Goku and his granddaughter, Pan, basicly just go around killing each dragon and taking each dragonball from each evil dragon, simple and probably the best arc GT has to offer.But these is where I need to point something out, GT does not know what mood to take, sometimes it gets really serious and dark, then next episode it gets so silly and whimsical that the first dragonball series seems more mature, never does it get into a comforable middle of these moods like DBZ does.I know I haven\'t touched everything yet (like super saiyan 4 for instance, or how Goku gets turned into a kid, sigh) but I feel like I have made my point.Except I will actually admit there is ONE thing and one thing only that GT actually does better than Z.And that is: The relevancy of the dragon balls, unlike Z where they simply used to bring people back to life, the dragon balls are so important to the plot that three of the major story arcs are heavily affected by the dragon balls, especially the shadow dragons arc.ANIMATION: I know it\'s a pre 2000\'s anime, but even DBZ looks better than most of GT\'s animation.SOUND: This is the only thing I\'ll say it\'s decent, Funimation\'s dub cast returns to repraise their roles, making the dub more than tolerable.Hahahahaha, except the really stupid rap for the opening theme.OVERALL:+ It\'s another dragonball adventure, and dbz fanbase loses its shit.+ The dragon balls are actually important to the plot.- Completely unoriginal- Doesn\'t know what mood to take- More plot holes than a fan fiction- It\'s another dragonball adventure, and dbz fanbase goes insane (DBAF) then go ahead and click unhelpful *STORY: Sequels, well they usually give justice to the original, or remind you that the original is as good as it gets.Dragonball Z, anime franchise king, the big long winded battle, overrated fail, BEST ANIME EVAR!!, whatever your take on DBZ is, you can not deny it\'s popularity, calling it a household name in Japan (And around the world) is more than an understatement.Probably the best best comparison I can made is: DBZ is like Mario, everyone knows what is it is.And of course one thing always happens when a series becomes popular, a sequel is made.I remember when I found out about Dragonball GT, I went crazy!

In some cases, they are right, as this is the only series not based off of Toriyama's manga and said manga-ka also had little to do with the series. However, judging it solely on that is unfair, so I'll try to do my best at giving GT a proper review.The one major thing that Dragonball GT suffers from is an identity crisis. It starts off as a primarily comedy anime with action as a secondary, something that worked very well for Dragonball and...occasionally worked here as well. Unfortunately, the series received poor ratings, mainly because everyone wanted more action and less goofing off. At about Episode 17, the focus shifted from comedy to action, and that's also when the plot started to suffer. It's difficult to be original when one uses plot devices that have been seen in so many other anime, not to mention done better. And as well all know, with a lack of originality comes boredom. At least this series is &quot;only&quot; 64 episodes in length, so it's not as much of a chore to sit through as, say, Dragonball Z.On an more positive note, the art and animation received a nice upgrade. Some of the character designs are a bit iffy, but it's still passable. The music is also rather good, especially the opening, DAN DAN Kokoro Hikareteku, and all four endings. I can safely say that I enjoy listening to all five songs on a regular basis.  The fights are enjoyable more often than not, though once again, I've seen better...much better.It may be far from perfect, but Dragonball GT at least makes an attempt to be entertaining. If you still want to watch, then by all means, go for it. Just don't expect too much, and enjoy the opening and endings as they come. occasionally worked here as well.

I\'ve seen GT rated below 5, I\'ve heard people saying they don\'t consider GT part of the series and is a disgrace and all that hate. Those people (which are probably the majority of you reading this who have seen GT so don\'t get pissed) don\'t take it for what it is. GT is not perfect, not even close. But it doesn\'t suck more than a vacuum...Story- I hear and read all the time about how ""awful"" the story is. Ok I admit, if the whole show was like the after Goku turns into a...kid but before the fight on Planet M-2 I would have trashed this show. But, it\'s not at all! The fight on M-2 really took everything up a couple of notches, the idea was so cool and of course the infamous Baby villain was introduced. Everything starts to fall into place for the Baby and Goku fight and c\'mon... SS4 is one of the coolest transformations in the whole series, even if you knew it was coming. The Super 17 saga was very dark and powerful. It was short lived but it needed the DBZ aspect to come back and give GT some more life and add a good intro to the Black Dragon saga. I get very confused when people say ""I don\'t like this saga"". I don\'t mind your opinion but you gotta give a reason... Some of the dragons were lame but the last fight was one of the best in DragonBall, DBZ and DBGT because of the power of Omega Shenron, the ""thing"" that happens with Goku and Vegeta (for those of you that don\'t know I wont spoil) and just the magnitude of the fight was epic. So what are the bad parts of the story??? Pacing in the beginning was an issue. It was slow and boring to start off and that\'s a big turn off for people and then they are ready to bash on all the bad that comes next and if they do that, they overlook the good. Also there\'s a character problem but let\'s wait till I get there.Art- This is weird but the art in the Baby arc and Super 17 arc was worse than the art of DBZ. Then it seemed like it changed a little for the final arc but it wasn\'t spectacular. I don\'t get bothered with bad art because I am in it for the story but I have to admit, seeing that an anime\'s prequel had better art than it did bothered the hell outta me. If you are someone that hates average or older looking art work than take caution.Sound-  I enjoyed the sound... it didn\'t copy all of DBZ\'s tracks (Thank GOD!) and I thought the opening is brilliant. The Dub is ok, I do not like kid goku and when he transforms and Sean Schemmel\'s voice comes back it\'s like heaven. Sound is really hard to judge.. I don\'t think I\'ve ever watched something with bad sound and I hope I never do haha. But it was average no complaints accept for some annoying Dub voices.Character- UGH! I am sure I am not alone on this. If I had two big problems on the show that I could rant about is 1.) why is Pan the most annoying character ever put on a screen... and 2.) why is it that no one accept for Goku and Vegeta can put up a fight? Everyone who was strong in DBZ is suddenly weak? Confusing nonetheless. The only reason I am not putting this lower is because of Goku, Vegeta, Uub, and the villains of the story.So, DBGT. Everyone loves to hate it. If you\'re someone who has watched DB and DBZ but you fear GT because of the reviews take it from me. If you try and compare GT to the first two you are going to want to never watch it again, there isn\'t really a comparison. Take GT for what it is. It\'s a not so serious mood of some cool fights and new transformations. The ending is very heart felt and can make some tear up, if they got one thing right the ending of GT was as perfect as ever. Even the last movies was amazing and heart felt. Don\'t hate GT until you find both the good and bad. Give it the credit it deserves, it\'s not the biggest screw up of anime, it\'s just a decent final chapter to everyone\'s favorite hero Goku. Don\'t hate GT plz, give GT some love! kid but before the fight on Planet M-2 I would have trashed this show. But, it\'s not at all! The fight on M-2 really took everything up a couple of notches, the idea was so cool and of course the infamous Baby villain was introduced. Everything starts to fall into place for the Baby and Goku fight and c\'mon... SS4 is one of the coolest transformations in the whole series, even if you knew it was coming. The Super 17 saga was very dark and powerful. It was short lived but it needed the DBZ aspect to come back and give GT some more life and add a good intro to the Black Dragon saga. I get very confused when people say ""I don\'t like this saga"". I don\'t mind your opinion but you gotta give a reason... Some of the dragons were lame but the last fight was one of the best in DragonBall, DBZ and DBGT because of the power of Omega Shenron, the ""thing"" that happens with Goku and Vegeta (for those of you that don\'t know I wont spoil) and just the magnitude of the fight was epic. So what are the bad parts of the story??? Pacing in the beginning was an issue. It was slow and boring to start off and that\'s a big turn off for people and then they are ready to bash on all the bad that comes next and if they do that, they overlook the good. Also there\'s a character problem but let\'s wait till I get there.Art- This is weird but the art in the Baby arc and Super 17 arc was worse than the art of DBZ. Then it seemed like it changed a little for the final arc but it wasn\'t spectacular. I don\'t get bothered with bad art because I am in it for the story but I have to admit, seeing that an anime\'s prequel had better art than it did bothered the hell outta me.

The best of both worlds, a merging of the original Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. Truly this is the perfect finale to the series.I loved this show so much as a kid and even more as an adult, and when I first found out that there were people who attack and hate on this show, I was so shocked and confused. There are so many people who haven\'t even watched GT and they think they hate it just because its popular to hate. And they go a...step beyond to try to knock it out of the Dragon Ball universe by dubbing it as ""non-Canon"" which is ridiculous because this is the sequel to the End of Z similar to how Z is the sequel to the End of DB. It would be silly for a DB fan to say Z isn\'t canon.People are too afraid to give GT much praise, some might speak a little good but they will then say its not ""perfect"" and that oh it has ""flaws"". But what is perfection? In reality there is no such thing as perfection, rather it is a personal matter and of taste. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder after all and one mans trash is another mans treasure. And to me this is a true gem. So if you enjoy this anime, try not to let the haters get to you, just remember: the dog barks but the caravan moves on. step beyond to try to knock it out of the Dragon Ball universe by dubbing it as ""non-Canon"" which is ridiculous because this is the sequel to the End of Z similar to how Z is the sequel to the End of DB.

The animation made it look like Goku was a stick figure given plastic 6 packs or something. Same goes for Trunks.The good and bad points about this anime:GOOD: If you actually live through this entire series, you just proved yourself to have unlimited patienceBAD: If you actually watched all the episodes (like me), you better find a hobby or counseling, fast.Honestly I only watched all that because of my love for Dragonball when I was very little, and as of that, I finished this anime...when I was very little. And boy did it warp my fragile little mind.I'm not going to go any farther, but I'll say that the story is like the same thing as Dragonball, but with more &quot;evil&quot; guys that make Hercule look like Cell. If you're curious about this anime, then watch it, but I warn you, many viewers are going to tear up their computers, curse themselves, and swear never to watch another anime again.

Thats kamehameha for you."", ""Dragon Ball GT. What can I say about it? Have you ever experienced something that is so perfect and beyond your wildest dreams that it almost seems not real? Well that's this show. GT is easily the best series to carry the Dragon Ball name, easily surpassing the original Dragon Ball and Z in both character development, plot, fight scenes, animation and comedy.The overall story line of the show is that a wish has been made on the black star dragon balls, which are a set of dragon balls that will destroy Earth in a years time once a wish has been made on...them. It's up to Goku, Trunks and Goku's granddaughter Pan to scour the universe in search of the scattered dragon balls in order to return them to Earth and stop the planet from blowing up. While that's just the initial plot of the first arc the story does get much deeper, darker, more sophisticated and surprisingly ground breaking with the following three arcs.It's clear right from the start that this anime was well ahead of its time. The animation and story telling of just the first episode alone is outstanding. All the charactera from the previous series return and their roles are better than ever. Gohan, Vegeta, Goten and others are put into supporting roles and lose most challenging fights they're in and rightfully so. The whole series seems to mainly focus on Goku and why shouldn't it? Some say GT stands for grand tour but I say it should stand for Goku time. Goku is clearly the only character that matters in this series and should be the only one that matters in the franchise. He's the best anime character ever created so why wouldn't they want him to be the main total focus of this series? This is 64 episodes of jam packed Goku action and I love it. Goku could effortlessly wipe the floor with all the other characters so there's no point in even trying to argue about having the other play a part in the story. They're not needed, none of them are, only Goku and that's just how it should have always been.The decision to make Goku a child again due to the wish made on the black star dragon balls was also a stroke of brilliance. Since he's a kid again we can now experience the original fun vibe of the original Dragon Ball series. However, he still has the power of his adult form so it makes it even better since he can fight like his Z counterpart, but act like his Dragon Ball counterpart. It's honestly genius and I don't know why Goku just didn't stay a kid forever in the original series. The addition of a new super saiyan form is also welcomed. Super saiyan 4 is by far the best design in the series, if not in any anime ever. The fact that it looks nothing like the other super saiyan forms makes it stand out and shows its true power. Truly a brilliant idea and I applaud the creators for making it. There will never be a transformation in anime that is as cool looking or as powerful as super saiayn 4. Fact.Having Goku's quarter saiyan granddaughter Pan accompany him on his journey was also a very smart move. It hearkens back to the dynamic of the original Dragon Ball with Bulma and Goku, but only better this time since she's part saiyan. The addition of an adult Trunks coming along for the journey is also welcomed. This adult version of Trunks is far better than the future version of Trunks we saw in the Cell saga in Z. This Trunks has flaws, thus making him more relatable, as well as making him funnier which provides several hilarious moments throughout the series. In fact, all the changes made to all the characters are good and only make them seem more three dimensional and real to the viewer.Overall Dragon Ball GT is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Ignore the haters, this is anime at its absolute best. Constantly pushing the boundaries of what a hardcore anime can do back in the 90's, GT is one of the best shows going.

Apparently, old-man Krillin is the strongest...But lets get to the key points on why it sucks:Story: Very poor. In the beginning, they attempted to recreate the feeling that the original Dragonball had, but they ultimately failed. In later parts of the story, they tried to recreate the Vegeta Saga, and later the Android Saga, but they have failed to keep me entertained. Overall, the story was full of disappointment. Instead of seeing other characters beating the enemies, Goku ends up doing so, which gets kind of repetitive.

Now i understand that the majority do hate GT, i don´t and i will explain why. I first started with DB, then i moved unto DBZ and then finally DBGT. As far as i can see, most people who hate DBGT have never even watched the OG DB. Why is this important? Because DBGT has the same kind of adventure feel like OG DB has, but with fights resembling DBZ so one might say that DBGT is a hybrid between DB and DBZ. Which is probably why most DBZ fans do not like it.  Now the arcs aren´t...perfect and not executed well, but i think they are still pretty good. The ending was very good and left me satisfied. Yes GT is no longer canon, but i do not consider DBZ and DBS canon either because i don´t like them and they are very different from the OG DB. ( Yes i know DB manga has both DB and DBZ in it, but not my point. ) I really loved the characters and the voice actors. ( I watched GT in Japanese, also the English dub has the same issue as DBZ that they change the dialogue which sometimes even change a character! It´s important that you understand this before you decide if you want to watch sub or dub. ) Well i´m pretty sure everybody has already watched GT by now.

Despite what everyone says about the anime, like the fact that it wasn\'t related to Akira\'s manga, I can\'t just say that I didn\'t enjoy watching it.Story changed its main line suddently, but the ""essence"" didn\'t fade, in my opinion. The  fighting theme still remained, as well as many other values, like hope and family. Strong bosses and great battles are also featured in it.Of course, it can\'t be compared to DB and doesn\'t even get close to DBZ, but I laughed, I cried, I believed...Since I watched it as kid (like DB and...DBZ), all those critics looked weird and I gave it a shot.

Being filler doesn't automatically make a show bad.GT doesn't just repeat arcs with little twists to make you think it's original like Super does, like Trunks coming from the future or a martial arts tournament, GT is creative and doesn't try to copy anything. Plus it has strong and interesting villains! Baby who can take over everyones bodies and Omega Shenron who absorbs the dragon balls to gain power.Also the transformations are wayyyy more unique, not just recoloring Super Saiyan to blue.

It had good characters, quirky humor, and epic battles, but it also had WAY too much filler, lazy animation, and could often get repetitive.What would happen if you took everything charming and lovable about DBZ and left just the flaws? You would get the absolute disgrace that is DBGT. No wonder Toriyama sama disowned this piece of shit!The plot starts out with the admittedly interesting choice to reintroduce Emperor Pilaf from the original Dragonball series. After Goku defeats him once again, Pilaf uses his wish to make Goku...into a little kid once again. GT desperately tries to recreate the youthful innocence of Dragonball, but fails without Toriyama's writing and humor. Although SSJ4 was sort of cool at the time, DBGT really adds very little of value to a Dragonball story and universe that was already nicely wrapped up. GT creates new villians for our heroes to fight, but none of them are very interesting or captivate our imagination. They don't terrify us as first form cell or Freeza did for many younger viewers. They don't get us to hate them passionately and long for their demise. They don't make us laugh like the villains from Dragonball often did. The newest Z warrior is Pan, but she is honestly pretty bland and not nearly as interesting as some of the female characters from Z like Cyborg 18. Gt's plot also creates about 20 plot holes a minute and clearly wasn't created by anyone who really gave a shit about the Dragonball franchise. It just wanted to squeeze as much money as it could out of fans' pockets.The music is admittedly alright. It isn't as good as DBZ's soundtrack, but it had a few decent opening and closing themes. The art is not susbstantially improved, nor is the animation quality. If I were to bother rating the art and sound, I suppose they would recieve decent scores, but I think some of that might just be because the story and characters were so bad that everything else seems good by comparison.Overall, DBGT is just a huge slap in the face to all Dragonball fans and everyone who grew up loving Mr. Toriyama's shonen classic. It is sad that we had to wait 20 years until Battle of Gods and Yo! Son Goku Returns to get a continuation of this beloved franchise.

I gave this show a real chance after years of avoiding it and it has become my favorite of the db series (3rd best behind Kai and original db imo). I love how they mixed original DB’s adventure with DBZ action and the art style is probably my favorite next to Cowboy Bebop. The soundtrack is top notch and really makes an impact as opposed to the dubbed version. The villians...are great and the fact it is only 64 eps makes it an easy watch. The dubbed version gave it a bad name and that is where these negative reviews come from. To be honest with you i’d rather have all the original team continuing DB right after dbz without Toriyama instead of 20 years later Toriyama helping just for a money grab and no passion. are great and the fact it is only 64 eps makes it an easy watch.

Don't take it too seriously.DB and DBZ where based on the mange, they had finished, along with the manga.After the series ended, a new range of games in Japan where due to come out, his is the reason why this mediocre-at-best series was released, in order to keep the franchise frest in people's minds.Breifing over...DBGT focuses a lot on Goku's granddaughter Pan, a vaccant, needy teenager who freeloads on Trunks' spaceship as he prepares to go into search in serach of the dragonballs, universewide, with Goku.The reason behind this...adventure is...

And considering it is a continuation of an existing franchise, it won\'t be possible for me to evaluate it based on its own.I will use Japanese Terms mainly because I watched it mainly in Japanese. Whenver I know the English Terms, I will use them.StoryDragon Ball GT is a sequel to the original Anime Adaptation of Toriyama\'s Dragon Ball manga and thus the third series following Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z.An old enemy of the Main Character Son Goku discovered the existence of another set...of Dragon Balls in the Heavenly Realm also called the Lookout.These Dragon Balls have been sealed away for reasons not even the eldery Prince Pilaf knows. By accident he wishes from the new Dragon Balls Son Goku back into a kid.These new sets of Dragon Balls created by the Former God before he split into Kami and Piccolo have the downside that they destroy the planet they were last used. And to stop that, they need to be brought back in time to their resting place before that happens to prevent said destruction.Thus Goku, Trunks and Goku\'s granddaughter Pan have to travel through space to collect the now scattered Ultimate Dragon Balls aka. Black Star Dragon Balls.Dragon Ball GT decided to make the Dragon Balls the focus on the story and they did several things to fix this problem. First is giving them consequences. While these consequences aren\'t big, it is a reasonable reason to start the adventure.Another thing is obviously the Dragon Balls splitting to space. Space is vast and not much of it was explored in Dragon Ball, including in Dragon Ball Z filler.Lastly is turning Goku into a kid. Goku as that point was a completely different tier of fighter. He is the strongest fighter in the Universe and can teleport anywhere under the right circumstances. To fix that issue, Goku was nerfed with an immature body restricting him to use the most powerful techniques and the ability to control his full power. As in one episode Goku accidently blew up a volcano instead of stopping the eruption.It also made him fit better to comic relief scenes. But his character itself wasn\'t affected by his new body.But trying to do such a story comes at a price. Fans of Dragon Ball have become used to the action and high stake fights in DBZ. Thus an adventure series, regardless how wholesome it is, felt boring.GT had a good atmosphere the early episodes, but a lot of questionable things happened around episode 6 or so. The transition to the high stake fights fans were looking for wasn\'t done that well and the fight against God of Destruction Luud raised a few eyebrows regarding the crews strength.However, the ending of this arc and pretty much ever GT arc is very satisfying. There is at least 1 or 2 very engaging battles such as against General Rildo and the first major antagonist following to the next arc, Baby.GT would eventually switch from DB adventure mode to DBZ\'s punching a badguy invading earth very hard. Many would consider GT to be a series with Good Idea and Bad Execution. The Baby Saga doesn\'t just have good ideas, but has also good execution.It has some parallels to the Saiyan and Frieza Saga focusing on Saiyan\'s history. But unlike the Saiyans being the enemy, they are the ones surpressed. Unlike in the Frieza arc where the enemy is just an aggressor of the Saiyans, it is a victim who wants justice.It is a very engaging story with very high stakes. Goku\'s best move is almost sealed in the Genkidama aka Spirit Bomb. Most allies are enemies. The Dragon Balls aren\'t as accessable to immediately solve everything. And Goku can\'t use his Teleportation to ask help from specific allies.The next arc is mostly considered the worst arc since its idea doesn\'t appear to be original. In hell, the scientist Dr Mu meets with Dr Gero. They team up to create a new enemy with their combined technology: Hell Fighter 17. An enemy that looks like Android 17. In the Japanese version it was stated that Android 17 has hidden powers that apparently surpasses Cell\'s and they want to brainwash and awaken him with his new technology. That leads to the Gate of Hell opening in the living world where old foes terrorize earth.The goal is to stop the scientist, the old nemesis and both 17 who merged to Super 17.The arc is insanely short. While many characters are involved and are useful, we don\'t see much to get a lot of this arc. Most of it is wasted on comic relief with Goku.The final fight is a double edged sword with a strong beginning, a mediocre middle part and ok ending.The last arc is one with the most potential. The Dragon Balls got cracked and all the negative energy was released creating the Shadow Dragons. Their power is independent from Dende and their power wary based on how much negative energy was generated from the wish generated.GT gave all Dragon Balls a negative consequence and thus this arc raises the stakes to a level not seen before. Now all problems can\'t be solved with just wishing them away since each wish could generate more negative energy and more Shadow Dragons in the future.Sadly the arc has a weak beginning. The first Shadow Dragons were defeated by plot convinience. Most allies sat back while Pan, Goku and Giru did most the work.The only ones excused are Bulma and Vegeta.Emotional conflict and good action would eventually happen once the 7-Star Dragon appeared. There were still some questionable fights inbetween, but overall the last 3 Shadow Dragon fights are considered the highlight of the final arc.GT\'s ending is bombastic and many consider it a satisfying conclusion to Dragon Ball. Including fans that don\'t like GT.Baby arc is without a doubt the reason to watch GT. The Shadow Dragon arc has a good concept with bad execution, but its highs are very high.The other arcs are mediocre but both end either satisfying or aren\'t too long to cause much damage.CharactersAnd Pan has been shown to be a very unreliable member. She only exist to be a damsel in distress but eventually saving her helped the crew to find another piece of a puzzle. Pan has been shown to be a good aid when it came to defeat Luud and also came in clutch in many other fights. However, not for the reasons fans would hope. And she never reached the potential anyone hoped her to do like her father Gohan in Dragon Ball Z.Pan starts off looking down on her grandpa Goku who became a child. Over the course of the series she would eventually respect him and help him to overcome some of the most difficult challenges.Besides the 17 arc, she has been very prominent in all of GT so far. I heard she is annoying in English, but in the Japanese version I felt her far more tolerable.Trunks is not very prominent besides the first arc. Unlike his future counterpart, he is taking more a mechanical role in GT and the member who keeps the group together. For people expecting him to get amazing fights, Trunks won\'t be satisfying. But he is coming very clutch when it was about to stop Dr. Mu in the Ultimate Dragon arc.He also showed courage in the face of an enemy like Yixinglong aka. Omega Shenron trying to buy time for Goku and Vegeta to perform fusion.Giru is a Machine Mutant who merged with the Dragon Radar. He was very suspicious but eventually became a core member of the crew. Solving certain issues and helping Pan out. He also helped Trunks\' plan by acting as a double agent to expose Dr. Mu.Son Goku is not very active character wise in the first arc. He is more like the wise mentor type of figure in the group. Able to analyse and adapt to fights as he was portrayed in Z. But most of it is seen best in the fight against Rildo and after.Goku went through several character arcs where he overcame challenges and misconceptions people have about Goku in Z. He overcame the Golden Oozaru. A powered up version of his giant monkey form in which he killed his grandpa in as a child. He learned to embrace and accept his Saiyan heritage fully and killed the last Tsufuru (or Tuffle). Mainly because Baby dared to lay his hands on his family.Goku would also take responsibility at the end for the Dragon Balls and honestly for a lot of things.If anything, with GT Goku\'s character went full circle ending his story in a very satisfying way.Vegeta despite not being a main character had a lot of prominence. He overcame his obsession with Goku since the Boo Saga and adapted to his earthly lifestyle. As a character he is very enjoyable to watch.Sadly Vegeta has no major victories as per usual. But also has not a lot of prominent fights.In the English version they took all that away with makes it awkward to watch.Baby is probably one of the best antagonists in the franchise. After losing his home planet to the Saiyans, he created Dr. Mu to collect him energy for several decades. Baby\'s goal is to create a new Tsufuru race and take revenge on the ones that wronged them. Sadly that have to be also the now peaceful descendants of the Saiyans.Baby contrary to his people is portrayed as pure evil. But to rebuild his race and being part of a royal bloodline, it can be argued that he feels its justified. Baby stopped seriously harming people after his evolution completed and he took over Vegeta\'s body (as he is a parasitic lifeform).We see how the new Tsufurus look up to Baby, how he greets them and appreciates them. But when he sees a Saiyan like Goku, his trauma kicks in where he would become the devil and even use his own underlings as a shield.Baby is the kind of villain that learns from his mistakes. Each confrontation he lost, he got something different and tried a new strategy to get what he wanted. Eventually he succeeded.Seeing that Goku has things he cares about, he is willing to use them to get the upper hand. For example a scene I liked is when Baby turned his back on Goku and fired an attack on earth. Purposely failing so Goku would stand before him to take the next attack full on.There are several scenes like that that keep the fight engaging.Super 17 started off as a generic underling character. He is a fusion of Hell Fighter 17 and the fully awakened Android 17. His design and fighting style is almost elegant. Even if the fight isn\'t very entertaining, it is beautiful to see him react. Even during the least enjoyable portion of his fight against Goku, he was vibing. He screams ""I am too cool to lose to you."".My favorite moment is his interaction with Android 18. 18 so far didn\'t do anything in GT. She lost her husband again and was beaten up by her brainwashed brother. She tried to reach his heart once more her own way which allowed 17 to regain his freedom from Dr Mu\'s control and try to do his own thing. It was a very satisfying moment for an antagonist with ""no"" character.Shadow Dragons are a mixed back. Yixinglong is the leader and has a similar presents to Frieza. He is willing to kill his own kind if it is to get what he wants. But he is also prideful giving his opponents a chance to fight him as long as he knows they can\'t win.Suxinglong aka. Nova Shenron is the most selfless dragon born from the most selfish wish. He represents the 4-Star ball and is the most honorable member of the dragons. Prefering a fair fight and sparing children and woman. He is one of the characters who gained Goku\'s respect. His brother Sanxinglong aka. Eis Shenron is the polar opposite. He as the 3-Star dragon and the 7-Star Dragon use others as a shield and tries to win by any means.Other characters have minimal roles. It would be a waste to talk about each. There are some really good arcs inbetween some, but I think I mentioned the most important ones with as little spoilers as possible.I am not much into using music to evaluate shows. The opening of Japanese GT is probably one of the best with Chala Head Chala. Music is placed in the most appropiate scenes. I personally like the use of silence in some scenes to create tension before a fight or after. One just has to watch Goku vs. Ledgic to get what I mean.The Shadow Dragon OST feels like beings from a different realm appeared or mystery. It is not clear what they truly want and what dangers awaits us.It is very enjoyable if one doesn\'t simply watch for the battles. The battles are short and bite sized. It has some really good jokes. And while there isn\'t much slice of life, when those scenes appear especially with Vegeta, they are enjoyable to watch.Art... I don\'t really care much about it. But GT may be the best looking Dragon Ball series so far. Very few episodes look awful and animation is pretty fluid.With this I end my review of Dragon Ball GT. Like Toriyama-Sensei would say, it’ll make me happy for us to watch and enjoy it together. of Dragon Balls in the Heavenly Realm also called the Lookout.These Dragon Balls have been sealed away for reasons not even the eldery Prince Pilaf knows.

But that SSJ4 transformation was  a little weird, because their pants changed, and somehow their shirts were removed. Baby had some good artwork put into him, but wasn't that creative storywise. The 7 dragons were quirky and weird, not all of them though, the final 3 were really good. But with everything comes its...flaws, Uub just didn't really fit in with the whole story. And the dragonball overusage doesen't make sense. With Piccolo's sacrifice, and plenty of deaths in the end, it was weird, but good in its own right, so next time you see it, take these things into consideration. flaws, Uub just didn't really fit in with the whole story.

I\'ve grown a distaste for pretty much of this to the point that all I like from this series is Krillin and Piccolo, which makes Dragonball GT even more annoying since they\'re not in it, but I\'ll get to that. GT is, simply put, a gigantic insult to anyone who loved Z.First off, I don\'t consider this a direct sequel or even a spin-off, it\'s a what-if made fan-fiction conceived by the unimpressive writing staff who worked under Toriyama. This proves just how flimsy the DBZ plot...was with him in charge, watching how this festering pile of feces made it into production. The biggest hurdle these clowns probably had was ""how do we manage to come up with a plot that is just coming off of the heels of the epic Buu story arc?"". Asking that question alone should\'ve alerted these nitwits that ANYTHING you attempt to create will be nowhere near as gripping as the Z Fighters battling the most powerful villian ever. Even turning Goku back into a child (a feeble generalization to make him weaker?), adds nothing more than short term laughs. I\'ll get to the kid Goku thing in a bit, back to the plot.They try early on to return to quest-based adventures that made Dragonball so enjoyable, but this clearly doesn\'t work, as the audience has been overexposed to the mind-numbing action of it\'s predecessor, and this new/old direction didn\'t sit well. So, with no substance or wit, GT quit being a light-hearted adventure and clumsily returned back to an action show. But the fights aren\'t the same. they lack the polish and pace of Z, and honestly, after watching Goku dispatch stronger enemies in the past, seeing him struggle with these interstellar geeks and dancing Par par Brothers (EEARRGGHH!!!!!) is quite insulting. If the writers were banking on the viewers saying ""Oh well the universe is huge, so strong enemies can be anywhere"", then nobody bought it. The story arcs just play out with little reason to care, especially the Baby story, which drags for what seems like an etenity. The Super 17 arc make little to no sense and is a bastardization of one of my favorite characters (17), but it\'s really short. The final arc is only story with credibility and makes some pretty solid reasoning in regards to the Dragonballs and their usage. The big downside to this in retrospective is just how utterly terrible these ""heroes"" are at saving the world, or anyone\'s lives for that matter. To have to run to a mystical dragon everytime they fail to protect their fallen comrades or an innocent race of people on a quaint little planet and wish them back to life makes the Z Warriors look very pathetic, and watching all of this come back to bite them in the ass was a little satisfying for me. By the way, constant revivals really cheapens the drama of a fight when we know they\'ll just be back, idiots!!For as bad as the story is, the characters is where GT really takes a nosedive. To start, i\'m going to get this out of the way: Goku has become my most hated shonen lead ever and is a strong candidate for the most despicable character in anime history. I know I\'m over-analyzing this, but this has bugged me for years about him. Back when he was a kid in Dragonball, his fish-out-of-water antics and tactlessness was kind of funny. In Dragonball Z, it got very annoying watching this karate bum ignore being a responsible father figure or a decent husband drove me crazy. ""But it\'s alright,"" people would say. ""It\'s Goku being Goku!"" NO. NO, no, no, NO! This mantra is drillied into not only the fans\' heads, but the characters as well! Am I supposed to give him a pass because beats up a couple of bad guys long after the heroes have been beaten to within an inch of their lives? I started to feel bad for Chi Chi for having to put up with this neglectful son of a bitch, but the writing ""convinced"" people into thinking she was just a nagging shrew who needed to step aside and let men hit each other! Hooray for objectifying women in such a one-demonsional tone!! So anyway, Goku is still the same miserable little golem in GT, just smaller and the act has worn thin. Trunks is no better, really serving no real purpose that I could speak of. He\'s not as funny as young Trunks from the Buu arc, and not as deep or interesting as Future Trunks, so he\'s dead weight. And then there\'s Pan, an annoying, grating, beastly little girl that\'s about as comfortable as sandpaper in your underwear. She\'s even more irritating than Bulma in her prime, and I can only conclude that this writing staff hated women in general. Oh, and all of your favorite other characters from Z? Not present!!! The entire damn show just focuses on those three. two characters that are burnt out and an original character that adds nothing you haven\'t seen already from Bulma in the past. The only other original character worth noting is Uub, who would\'ve been better suited joining the quest in the beginning instead of Trunks. He had potential to be a pretty cool character, but is quickly forgotten about and is tossed aside like any other character who isn\'t a damn saiyan. Long time favorites like Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo, Vegeta, serve little purpose outside of punching bags for the new uninspired and rehashed villains until Goku shows up and pulls the same tired act we\'ve seen before, only worse.IN CLOSING: I honestly could rant forever about this, but I\'ll spare you. I chalk GT up as a prime example of a franchise that has long overstayed it\'s welcome. Even DBZ Kai just looks like a decrepit old man at a party with hip kids like Soul Eater and Tiger & Bunny trying to talk about how cool he was when he was in school, GT is a complete debacle to anything that would make an anime entertaining. Tired characters, lazy writing, poor attention to detail, does nothing new, lame villains, same scenery, bad jokes, awful Funimation soundtrack, lame animation, stupid-looking Super Saiyan 4, mediocore ending...All of this combines to make a hideous amalgam  of a once decent and enjoyable franchise.STORY: 4ART: 5SOUND: 4CHARACTERS: 3REWATCHABLIITY: 2OVERALL SCORE: 2 out of 10PROS: The Don Don Kokorou opening theme is one highlight of this messCONS: For cons, scroll to top and reread was with him in charge, watching how this festering pile of feces made it into production.

As in, if one hasn\'t watched DB AND (not or) DBZ, chances are, they are not gonna understand DBGT. This series is mainly a nostalgia ride, that wants its audience to experience all the charms of DB and DBZ one last time, all over again.Dragon Ball wasn\'t all about fighting and beam clashes, it was more about the adventure. As a kid I was so amazed by the creativity. Elements inspired by ""Journey to the West"", ""Chang\'e"", a world where dinosaurs and high tech coexist, demons, martial arts, and etc. All of those elements don\'t sound coherent at all, yet in this series they blend together so well. Some series can\'t even tackle one theme properly.Then DBZ came in, took a huge turn, and decides to focus on the real shounen fighting aspect. They stood their ground, albeit having a few issues such as unwanted fillers, dragged out battles and etc.Now onto the DBGT part.(Spoilers alert)(Although I don\'t think it is that important here, in the world DB, There aren\'t much twists, and it always ends with ""and then Goku killed them"".)Story:We start off with Goku training with adult Uub in Kami\'s Lookout. Right off the bat they showed that they gave more fucks about continuity than DBS ever did. Ya remember Uub? The prodigy that appeared at the end of DBZ that never appeared in DBS for some reason despite it being the ""CANON"" series????Then we see old Pilaf and its gang encountering the Black Star Dragon Balls by accident, and after a series of events, turned Goku into a kid. It turns out, now, thanks to that, the Earth would explode in a year unless they collect them back. A brilliant setup for another dragon ball seeking journey if you ask me. Collecting Dragon Balls had become such a minute task in DBZ thanks to flying and Dragon Ball radar. So if the Earth won\'t cut it anymore, how do we setup another journey to seek for the Dragon Balls? Simple: IN SPACE!And of course, nerf Goku, so he can\'t Instant Transmission his way to the balls in minutes.Now there are plotholes regarding the origins of the Black Star Dragon Balls, but they aren\'t THAT serious.-Didn\'t Super Buu destroy the Lookout? Didn\'t Kid Buu destroy the Earth? Isn\'t Dende the only one that can create Dragon Balls now that Kami has fused with Piccolo?Chances are, Porunga restored the Black Star balls along with the Earth during the final Buu fight.-What does the Black Stars balls have to do with Piccolo? Why does him dying deactivate the balls? Even if the former God made them, and the ability got passed on to Kami, shouldn\'t the balls already deactivate the moment Kami fused with him?I have absolutely no way to explain this. Definitely a fuck up in the writing department.But it is a plothole I am willing to look pass.Onto the space stuff.This is the part where most people hate, they think this part is pointless and stuff, and honestly, I understand. But I absolutely disagree. This is where the passion really shines. (The music plays a part too. I\'ll get to it later.)I adore how this time around they not only wanted to write a creative adventure, they wanted to add in a few messages as well, which is something DB or DBZ never did. Back then it was mostly ah shit, trouble, and boom Z fighters save the day, period.The first planet, Imecka, was about greed and dictatorship. The scene where the gang realized every furniture in the hotel room had their prices rising exponentially; terrifying af. Seeing the citizens, living like prisoners on the planet where everything costs a fortune, saying how they would love to fight back if they could, like I mean, when did DB or DBZ ever attempt shit like this?And this arc ended with Ledgic, the bodyguard, betraying the dickwad dictator that is Don Kee, after being impressed by Goku\'s fighting prowess and humility. Just shows how although money is powerful, relying entirely on that ain\'t gonna get you far if you are weak.The second planet, Monamaasu,is pretty boring.But it does tell you to not judge a book by its cover, and don\'t be someone you\'re not.Pan dressed up as a bee, to only regret being seen as a bee by actual bees.The giant they avoided, turned out to be a very nice guy.That is cute.The third planet, Gelbo, is an interesting one.The story here is very similar to Oolong\'s in DB: Insecurity making one use their talents for evil, by pretending to be someone much more intimidating.The story here is inspired by a Japanese myth, which I am too lazy to talk about here.Now, this is a concept that has been done before, except in Zoonama\'s case, I felt for him. Oolong was just a pervert, from start to finish. Zoonama, however, imagine being a monster that can predict disasters, but have no way to stop it at all. Not only that, well, you are A MONSTER, people most likely won\'t believe you even if you approach them nicely. That is scary.(Glad to see Princess Trunks is not just an idea from a parody.)Next, fuck the bon para brothers, they suck.Next up, we have Luud. And oh boy I love this part.Having a bunch of blind followers worship a God, making them think this God can bring them healing and salvation, only to have them find out the God is a MAN-MADE MACHINE, AND THE APPARENT LEADER OF THE CULT HAS A HOBBY OF KEEPING CUTE PUBESCENT GIRLS AS DOLLS??? Like yo I don\'t remember Dragon Ball being this ballsy with its messages, THEY FUCKING MOCKED THE TOXIC PART OF CHRISTIANITY! WHY ARE PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THIS??!!And it is so hilarious to see how the ""real leader"" keeps changing.Is it the guy with the whip? No, it is the whip itself.Wait no, here comes a dude with a doll fetish.Wait no, there is a scientist.Wait nope again, the scientist is man-made.So many people thought that they are the ones with the leading role, only to find out they are just vessels in the end.Brilliant writing. 10/10.Up next, Rudeeze.They focused more on the emotional stuff here with Pan. Not wanting to be treated like a kid, misunderstanding, rebellion, all that jazz. Considering DB franchise\'s target audience, I can totally imagine people finding this part annoying. But I love the way they care about their characters here, unlike FUCKING DBS.(I will shit on it a lot more in this review)Giru>>>>>>>>Jaco. Fuck Jaco.Next up, M-2, Giru\'s home planet.This arc kinda blows.Very slow paced, dragged out for too long, Giru\'s ""betrayal"" wasn\'t fun to watch, the mecha pals were stupid and Rilldo sucks.Why have Goku say Rilldo has a ki stronger than Buu\'s, only to have him being obviously weaker/less intimidating than Buu?Giru wanting to see its home planet is a good idea, but the execution is kinda flat.Too bad THIS is the arc that leads to the grand reveal of Baby.The Baby stuff is the part where the series wants to shift from DB style to DBZ style, they brought back the whole ""Saiyans used to destroy planets"" part to tell you, yup, shit is gonna get real now.The concept of a different race wanting revenge on Saiyans has been done before in a DBZ OVA, but Hatchiyack sucked anyway.The Baby arc is pretty good.The despair when Goku and Pan realized they did all that work for pretty much nothing, and now the whole world is against them; that was powerful.I do not want to talk about the Otherworld board game part.Fuck the racoons.I will talk about Uub and Majin Buu in the ""Characters"" part.After a series of events, bam. Super Saiyan 4. What a glorious form. Spending 20+ episodes with Kid Goku, then seeing him snap, and turn into an adult again. THAT is a transformation. NOT A TINGLE IN THE BACK. NOT A FUCKING TINGLE.Super 17 blows.They needed a reason for the gang to use the Dragon Balls again, so they can actually get to the best part.Like what the fuck man I thought Myuu was an android HOW DID HE END UP IN HELL? Oh wait, he is a ""machine mutant"", ok maybe it is my bad-Oh wow Android 19 is here as well, why fuck me, never mind.It is nice to see how Android 18 actually cares for Krillin after seeing how she treated him in the Baby Saga, but that\'s about it.The Evil Dragons part though. What a way to end the series.Actually caring about what the Elder Kaioshin had said, rather than have him go ""oh I forgot the Potara Earrings only last 1 hour for non Gods""? Hell ya.Goku wanted to leave it to the new generation at the end of Cell Saga, and now they brought it back. Gone along with Shenron, but you know he\'ll always be around. Like how Pan believed she saw him towards the end decades later. That\'s an adventure.(Why the fuck does Vegeta Jr\'s mom look like Bulma though? The more I think about it the more wrong it gets.)Overall, clunky at parts, but I love the spin they took on this series.Art:OH WOW, ACTUALLY BUFF MAIN CHARACTERS WITH FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THAT DON\'T LOOK LIKE GARBAGE! AMAZING.Ok, the art here is weaker than that of DBZ, but it is still ok.The worst parts? Some scenes are obviously Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V\'ed.The design for Super Saiyan 4 is magnificent. Great to see a real transformation that isn\'t just hair dye of a different color.The fight scenes are meh. It doesn\'t have the highs that DB and DBZ had, but it doesn\'t take 5 episodes to charge an attack, so it is not all bad.Sound:If you watched this with Eng Dub and the action-y music, I can understand why you hate this. That bullshit ruined the whole purpose of this series. This series is not DB, not DBZ, but a ""final ride of nostalgia"".Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku is one of the best anime OPs.A good enough standalone love song, that also fits the theme.""Looking indifferent on the outside, but look, I am in love with you.""This ride allowed me to love Dragon Ball all over again.(If anything the Jap dub of Oozaru Goku\'s roars are dumb, but hey they didn\'t last long.)Character:Another proof that this series gave more fucks than DBS.Goku:Same ol\' Goku, who is a dumbass, and loves fighting. Although he hates underhanded tactics, when it comes to it, he will get shit done and only asks for challenges when it DOESN\'T CAUSE TROUBLE TO THE WHOLE FUCKING MULTIVERSE.Vegeta:DBS didn\'t ruin Vegeta , but DBGT still did a better job.Both have him becoming softer thanks to life on Earth, but they went a step further in DBGT.That scene where Vegeta believe Goku had died, and asked the younger Saiyans to leave the planet, as he decided to sacrifice himself? The part where he hated how he was going to witness his home being destructed AGAIN? That hit home.Gohan:Also nerfed like in DBS.Though not gonna lie, DBS Gohan towards the end is better than GT Gohan.He has nothing noteworthy here except being Pan\'s dad.Goten:Is the second son of Son Goku.But hey, he actually grew up like a normal person would, so... Yay?Trunks:His friendship with Pan and Giru is cute. Having him seeing her as a hindrance at the beginning, not realizing he hurt her feelings, and then apologizing, good stuff.After the space travel he is pretty much just like Goten though.Piccolo:The motive of his sacrifice is great (disregarding the plotholes).His talk with Gohan before his death is great.Seeing Piccolo going to hell to help Goku out is great.Nothing extraordinary, nothing stupid like getting kicked out by a bug.Pan:Second best 10-year old character after Gohan.Apparently people found her annoying.Dude she wasn\'t raised by a green man at the age of 4, never had to deal with his daddy leaving out of nowhere, she was pretty much an ordinary girl.It is impressive how she isn\'t scared to get her hands dirty for the sake of what she loves.Hell, she was the reason Goku was able to reach Super Saiyan 4.The part where Pan asked Goku to kill the Seven Star Dragon even if it means killing her? Come on.Giru:Pan\'s best buddy.Krillin and Android 18:Fine in DBS, fine in DBGT, like how the turtle poked fun at Krillin for dying so many times, that\'s about it.Uub, Majin Buu and Mr. Satan:Who the fuck is cutting onions?Buu in DBS is a disgrace. Of all things, sleep? Really? BUU WASN\'T EVEN LIKE THIS IN DBZ!!His friendship with Mr. Satan in DBGT is wonderful. His goodbye to him after being buddies for so long, before becoming one with Uub again, amazing.One of the filler eps in DBGT features Mr. Satan feeling down because he left, he even wanted to retire from being a ""hero"", only to regain confidence after ""defeating Uub"", THANKS TO BUU IN UUB\'S SUBCONSCIOUS. So good.Too bad Uub then received the Ultimate Gohan treatment though.Baby:Menacing as fuck.Many people make fun of his name, but to me, being beaten by a villain with THAT name is a much scarier thought.Obliterates Super Saiyan 3 like it is nothing, and if it wasn\'t for Supreme Kai intervening, he would\'ve won.Super 17:Ugh.They wanted to pull that whole ah, siblings, can\'t kill in the end after all shtick but God.I have nothing to say about this villain.He is nothing.Just a tool for the people to use Dragon Balls again so we can get to the good part.The Shadow Dragons:Does their job well.One thing I gotta commend though.Nuova Shenron ACTUALLY DISRUPTS GOKU WHILE HE WAS CHARGING THE KAMEHAMEHA, LIKE FINALLY SOMEONE WITH THE INTELLIGENCE TO DO IT!And Syn/Omega Shenron? YES! DON\'T JUST STAND THERE AND WATCH THEM FUSE/CHARGE THE SPIRIT BOMB, FIRE AT THEM! DO SOMETHING!Enjoyment:Ya I like DBGT a lot. It definitely got its stinkers, but cramming DB and DBZ elements into 64 episodes is very difficult, and I believe they pulled it off pretty well.As someone who grew up with DB and DBZ and actually gave a shit about the characters, I think this series paid a lot of respect to its prequels.Easily the weakest among the trilogy (GT is my head-canon, fight me), but I find it as enjoyable as the other two.Hell sometimes even more than DBZ, I can see myself re-watching DBGT, but not DBZ. I don\'t mind it being long, but I mind it dragging.Overall:7/10 objectively, but this is my list, and I can\'t stand its score being lower than DBS.8/10. Wonderful ride. And it is fucking obvious.This is not a series that can be enjoyed as a standalone. As in, if one hasn\'t watched DB AND (not or) DBZ, chances are, they are not gonna understand DBGT. This series is mainly a nostalgia ride, that wants its audience to experience all the charms of DB and DBZ one last time, all over again.Dragon Ball wasn\'t all about fighting and beam clashes, it was more about the adventure.

Oh wait, he is a ""machine mutant"", ok maybe it is my bad-Oh wow Android 19 is here as well, why fuck me, never mind.It is nice to see how Android 18 actually cares for Krillin after seeing how she treated him in the Baby Saga, but that\'s about it.The Evil Dragons part though. What a way to end the series.Actually caring about what the Elder Kaioshin had said, rather than have him go ""oh I forgot the Potara Earrings only last 1 hour for non Gods""? Hell ya.Goku wanted to leave it to the new generation at the end of Cell Saga, and now they brought it back. Gone along with Shenron, but you know he\'ll always be around. Like how Pan believed she saw him towards the end decades later. That\'s an adventure.(Why the fuck does Vegeta Jr\'s mom look like Bulma though? The more I think about it the more wrong it gets.)Overall, clunky at parts, but I love the spin they took on this series.Art:OH WOW, ACTUALLY BUFF MAIN CHARACTERS WITH FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THAT DON\'T LOOK LIKE GARBAGE! AMAZING.Ok, the art here is weaker than that of DBZ, but it is still ok.The worst parts? Some scenes are obviously Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V\'ed.The design for Super Saiyan 4 is magnificent. Great to see a real transformation that isn\'t just hair dye of a different color.The fight scenes are meh. It doesn\'t have the highs that DB and DBZ had, but it doesn\'t take 5 episodes to charge an attack, so it is not all bad.Sound:If you watched this with Eng Dub and the action-y music, I can understand why you hate this. That bullshit ruined the whole purpose of this series. This series is not DB, not DBZ, but a ""final ride of nostalgia"".Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku is one of the best anime OPs.A good enough standalone love song, that also fits the theme.""Looking indifferent on the outside, but look, I am in love with you.""This ride allowed me to love Dragon Ball all over again.(If anything the Jap dub of Oozaru Goku\'s roars are dumb, but hey they didn\'t last long.)Character:Another proof that this series gave more fucks than DBS.Goku:Same ol\' Goku, who is a dumbass, and loves fighting. Although he hates underhanded tactics, when it comes to it, he will get shit done and only asks for challenges when it DOESN\'T CAUSE TROUBLE TO THE WHOLE FUCKING MULTIVERSE.Vegeta:DBS didn\'t ruin Vegeta , but DBGT still did a better job.Both have him becoming softer thanks to life on Earth, but they went a step further in DBGT.That scene where Vegeta believe Goku had died, and asked the younger Saiyans to leave the planet, as he decided to sacrifice himself? The part where he hated how he was going to witness his home being destructed AGAIN? That hit home.Gohan:Also nerfed like in DBS.Though not gonna lie, DBS Gohan towards the end is better than GT Gohan.He has nothing noteworthy here except being Pan\'s dad.Goten:Is the second son of Son Goku.But hey, he actually grew up like a normal person would, so... Yay?Trunks:His friendship with Pan and Giru is cute. Having him seeing her as a hindrance at the beginning, not realizing he hurt her feelings, and then apologizing, good stuff.After the space travel he is pretty much just like Goten though.Piccolo:The motive of his sacrifice is great (disregarding the plotholes).His talk with Gohan before his death is great.Seeing Piccolo going to hell to help Goku out is great.Nothing extraordinary, nothing stupid like getting kicked out by a bug.Pan:Second best 10-year old character after Gohan.Apparently people found her annoying.Dude she wasn\'t raised by a green man at the age of 4, never had to deal with his daddy leaving out of nowhere, she was pretty much an ordinary girl.It is impressive how she isn\'t scared to get her hands dirty for the sake of what she loves.Hell, she was the reason Goku was able to reach Super Saiyan 4.The part where Pan asked Goku to kill the Seven Star Dragon even if it means killing her? Come on.Giru:Pan\'s best buddy.Krillin and Android 18:Fine in DBS, fine in DBGT, like how the turtle poked fun at Krillin for dying so many times, that\'s about it.Uub, Majin Buu and Mr. Satan:Who the fuck is cutting onions?Buu in DBS is a disgrace. Of all things, sleep? Really? BUU WASN\'T EVEN LIKE THIS IN DBZ!!His friendship with Mr. Satan in DBGT is wonderful. His goodbye to him after being buddies for so long, before becoming one with Uub again, amazing.One of the filler eps in DBGT features Mr. Satan feeling down because he left, he even wanted to retire from being a ""hero"", only to regain confidence after ""defeating Uub"", THANKS TO BUU IN UUB\'S SUBCONSCIOUS. So good.Too bad Uub then received the Ultimate Gohan treatment though.Baby:Menacing as fuck.Many people make fun of his name, but to me, being beaten by a villain with THAT name is a much scarier thought.Obliterates Super Saiyan 3 like it is nothing, and if it wasn\'t for Supreme Kai intervening, he would\'ve won.Super 17:Ugh.They wanted to pull that whole ah, siblings, can\'t kill in the end after all shtick but God.I have nothing to say about this villain.He is nothing.Just a tool for the people to use Dragon Balls again so we can get to the good part.The Shadow Dragons:Does their job well.One thing I gotta commend though.Nuova Shenron ACTUALLY DISRUPTS GOKU WHILE HE WAS CHARGING THE KAMEHAMEHA, LIKE FINALLY SOMEONE WITH THE INTELLIGENCE TO DO IT!And Syn/Omega Shenron? YES! DON\'T JUST STAND THERE AND WATCH THEM FUSE/CHARGE THE SPIRIT BOMB, FIRE AT THEM! DO SOMETHING!Enjoyment:Ya I like DBGT a lot. It definitely got its stinkers, but cramming DB and DBZ elements into 64 episodes is very difficult, and I believe they pulled it off pretty well.As someone who grew up with DB and DBZ and actually gave a shit about the characters, I think this series paid a lot of respect to its prequels.Easily the weakest among the trilogy (GT is my head-canon, fight me), but I find it as enjoyable as the other two.Hell sometimes even more than DBZ, I can see myself re-watching DBGT, but not DBZ. I don\'t mind it being long, but I mind it dragging.Overall:7/10 objectively, but this is my list, and I can\'t stand its score being lower than DBS.8/10. Wonderful ride.', 'Toriyama had gotten so fed up with the franchise, he only made the character designs and left Toei to make whatever plot they could think of. The result was a mediocre show many came to hate as non-canon, since Toriyama, the genius of good storytelling, did not write a bunch of bullshit for somehow making the show any less terrible that it had already become. It’s kind of hypocritical on part of the fans to call it awful when most of them kept making fan fiction and fan art out of GT, regardless of not being canon. All it mattered was getting more damn Dragonball...goddammit, so let’s stop complaining about something most eventually accepted as an excuse for writing and drawing. Toyotaro included.The beginning of GT was somewhat promising, as it had to do with looking for the dragonballs all across the universe, with a time limit before Earth blows up. Goku becoming a kid again was an attempt to power him down, so he wouldn’t be spamming his teleport ability, or defeat everyone with SSJ3. There were still issues with the premise, such as retconning an extra set of dragonballs, found by Pilaf in Kami’s palace. Entering a place no mortal can simply walk in, was a plot hole.But it was not the first time the plot didn’t make any sense and not even the biggest problem of GT. What really damaged the overall was how plain it was. Toriyama may have foddered everyone who was not a saiyan in Z, but he still bothered to show them trying to do something, as useless as it was. Toei didn’t even do that. By now there were two dozen super powerful heroes on Earth, aware of the situation, and nobody seemed to care much. They just send three children to gather the balls and did nothing thereafter, as if it wasn’t a big deal. That was the actual problem with GT. It didn’t know what to do with its cast.Even if you tired to evaluate the story as a simple adventure with a small cast, like back in the beginning of the franchise, it was still not good, because the characters were not selfish jerks with character flaws, trying to backstab each other for personal gain. They were a team of generic good guys, facing every danger with a common goal in mind. And even the challenges they were encountering weren’t threatening, as the villains were easy to defeat.It became somewhat more interesting when Baby was introduced as a major threat, a life form who could not only steal powers, but also possess anyone he was touching. His goal of avenging the deaths of his civilization at the hands of the saiyans was also very interesting, as it was leaving an opening for the heroes to have a personal connection with something from their past once again. Technically, he was a much better version of Cell.Vegeta in particular could be facing the demons of his past when confronting this guy. Unfortunately, nothing of the sort happened. The only change Vegeta got was a lame moustache, and Baby didn’t force anyone to consider the vanity of fighting, since he was simply brainwashing them with a touch. Mind control doesn’t leave any room to get philosophical.As if that wasn’t enough of an issue, Goku was the one defeating him, as always, and not only he didn’t think about the constant problems his battle frenzy was causing, he also defeated Baby with another power-up that came seemingly out of nowhere. SSJ4 was, again, an interesting concept, as it was bringing back the saiyan tails and, in theory, was the next logical step in their evolution, as they could stack their giant ape forms atop their SSJ forms, while also having control of their battle frenzy. This could have been the ultimate answer to what Baby was representing. And again, nothing remotely smart came out of it, it was just another generic power-up Goku used for defeating a villain.The ending to this arc was bizarre, since they failed to save the Earth. This could have been the chance to make humanity turn against the Z warriors in their frustration for losing their planet and having to relocate elsewhere. And not even that was treated like something important, since they kept living on a completely different planet and that was the end of it. So basically, this entire arc was a constant middle finger, as it kept throwing all these great concepts at you, without even bothering to do something with them.The next one about Super 17 was so lazily written. Somehow the gates of hell open, somehow the bad guys build another android 17 in hell, and it somehow needed to fuse with the original for getting a power up. What was that bullshit, other than an excuse to show Goku fighting Frieza and Cell again? And even that wasn’t any fun, since they only used a freezing machine of all things, the lamest thing ever. And as before, the dead came back to life, which was technically the apocalypse, yet it meant nothing for the characters or humanity as a whole. There was no gravity behind these events, as if everyone had been completely desensitized. So what was the point of even making this crap? Because the shonentards wanted to see more damn Dragonballs goddammit.Predictably, the last arc with the shadow dragons, suffered from the same issue. The dragonballs became evil after being abused for so many years and turned into monsters aiming to destroy everything. The heroes were facing the consequences of their pride and vanity. What did they do about it? Nothing. They just send the same kids to fix everything, since nothing matters. And seriously, as the strongest and final opponents, the shadow dragons looked so lame. How were you supposed to take them seriously when they looked like shit and were waiting to be defeated one at a time by a bunch of kids?The final showdown between Gogeta and Omega Shenron was fun on a superficial level, but it had none of the energy of the earlier arcs. Everybody was moving so slowly despite getting constantly stronger, SJJ4 was nerfed to the point it can be achieved with a simple machine, and Pan was a useless addition, being there just for making embarrassing jokes. Even at the very end, GT proved to be full of good ideas that were never used properly. It was a shameless cashgrab with no passion for whatever was going on in it. That’s why it’s so bad and deserves no more than a 1/10. goddammit, so let’s stop complaining about something most eventually accepted as an excuse for writing and drawing.

Why are they in outer space?  I later watched it on DVD and it fell into place for me.  Dragon Ball GT isn't cannon.  I watched this before most people, me included, didn't know or care.  This was one of the first series I watched about ten years ago.This series is all about fun and finding the Dragon Balls in the cosmos.  Why because the Dragon Balls got scattered across the galaxy.  The...series is fun a lot like Dragon Ball, but lacks the character depth and perhaps relevance (now with the cannon Dragon Ball Super).  It's not a waste of time, if you liked Dragon Ball you will like GT.The art is on par with the other Dragon Ball titles.  The sound is great as I love the opening (my second favorite song in the Dragon Ball series).You can skip this series, it's not cannon, but you'll be missing out on a memorable galactic adventure.  Also the ending is satisfying even though Akira Toriyama didn't write it. series is fun a lot like Dragon Ball, but lacks the character depth and perhaps relevance (now with the cannon Dragon Ball Super).

So you may ask: ""how can a claimed number 1 fan cangive such low score to DBGT?"" well here is the answer:Am I the only one who noticed that goku is the ONLY fighter that still into fighting?? everyone continued with their lives and quit fighting. Ghoan is now studing and look nerd as ever, Goten is a teenage boy who only wants girls, nobody doesn\'t know where piccolo is witch is kinda sad if...you ask me, they turend Trunks to some gay kid and not the badass trunks we saw from the future in DBZ, and the worst part of it is that EVEN VEGETA has quit fighting!! how vegeta can quit fighting when all his dream is to be a better warrior the Goku (or Kakarot as vegeta would have prefered)!He doesn\'t even trying to achieve super saiyan 3 how he can be so calmed about this?!?!In DBGT we see a new form of Goku, that\'s right SUPER SAIYAN 4! the scene where he\'s transforming is absolutely AMAZING but when he finally achieved the form he only uses super saiyan 4, the series neglected super saiyan 2 Completely.Goku became very selfish and he doesn\'t fell the same person in DBGT.

It was one of the best moments of my life', 'This is my personal opinion, so when reading, please, do not get personal.Some of the qualities that DB (DB, DBZ and, as a more or less full-fledged successor to DB - DBGT) differ from Naruto and similar shonens are:1. The absence of unnecessary chatter.This is a huge plus for me personally. Tired of listening to this endless stream of words, in which there is more water than in a student\'s diploma. Heh, ironic, isn\'t it?2. Characters and their motivation.One of the main components of any work is its characters and their motivation.The motivation of opponents should not be told to them, but shown by his...actions, along the way, if necessary, clarifying the details. What makes it brighter and more alive.A prime example is Frieza. What is his motivation? Obviously - the desire to achieve absolute power over the universe. That is why he flew to Namek, since the most terrible enemy of the ruler, in addition to his personal problems, is old age, and therefore death.He is powerful, smart, strict, restrained, cold-blooded. However, what is inherent in a realistic antagonist has flaws that have a logical explanation (after all, the strongest and most dangerous enemy that the Z fighters faced), and not the typical stereotyped childhood drama (Jiren, well, 80% of Naruto characters). That is what draws us to him.In DBGT, there are not that many such characters, but at least two can be distinguished: Baby and Syn Shenron.Motivation 1- revenge for the destruction of the tsufurujin race, 2- show what comes with the excessive use of pearls.At the same time, there are antagonists who have a code of honor, such as Su Shenron. He could have taken the pearls, killed Pan, but did not, preferring a fair fight, unlike his brother.What\'s in Super? There is not a single character that would be interesting to watch, based on this, we can conclude that ""Super"" is more a product than a work. And then everything falls into place. And it\'s sad.3. Fights.Combat in DB has always been something special, because it was in them that the hero became who he is.There is no whining in them, like: ""This world hates me, so I will destroy it! Aaaaaa!"" (Quote from Naruto).There were some good fights in Naruto though. A striking example is the fight between Might Guy and Madara. This is where the atmosphere of DB is felt. Guy puts his life on the line to protect what he holds dear without whining about hate. He just goes and fights, giving his all for what matters to him.These are the fights that are interesting, but, unfortunately, there are only a few of them.Personally, I get bored watching fights just for the action. This creates a feeling of tension, lack of motivation, which is what the last Dragon Ball Super movie showed.Take as an example the fight between Goku and Vegeta from the Saiyan Arc.In this battle, the battle was not so much between them, but rather between their ideals. One is a member of the elite, the other is a low-class member of their race.Vegeta, being a nobility, by the standard believed that since he was an elite, then an ordinary Saiyan was not able to surpass him and underestimated Goku to the very end. That is why Goku\'s phrase: ""Even a commoner, with sufficient effort, can surpass the elite"" puts an end to their battle and the balance is tilted in the direction of Goku.This shows Goku\'s growth as a person, which later became the reason for Goku\'s constant superiority over Vegeta throughout the Saiyan Arc and Frieza.In DBGT, especially in the fight against Super Syn Shenron, this atmosphere is very clear.As a result, I will say this: DBGT, although not up to its predecessors, but to some extent was able to maintain the atmosphere, the spirit that the original had.That is why the ending of DBGT, the final battle between Super Syn Shenron, I think is the best end of the entire franchise as a whole, so to speak, the result. In Super, not only is there no point, there is no introduction, just like the main part. There are a lot of ideas for implementation, since the Dragon Ball Universe is very plastic, but as long as the authors are led by profit, nothing worth waiting for is worth it. End! actions, along the way, if necessary, clarifying the details. What makes it brighter and more alive.A prime example is Frieza. What is his motivation?

This creates a feeling of tension, lack of motivation, which is what the last Dragon Ball Super movie showed.Take as an example the fight between Goku and Vegeta from the Saiyan Arc.In this battle, the battle was not so much between them, but rather between their ideals. One is a member of the elite, the other is a low-class member of their race.Vegeta, being a nobility, by the standard believed that since he was an elite, then an ordinary Saiyan was not able to surpass him and underestimated Goku to the very end. That is why Goku\'s phrase: ""Even a commoner, with sufficient effort, can surpass the elite"" puts an end to their battle and the balance is tilted in the direction of Goku.This shows Goku\'s growth as a person, which later became the reason for Goku\'s constant superiority over Vegeta throughout the Saiyan Arc and Frieza.In DBGT, especially in the fight against Super Syn Shenron, this atmosphere is very clear.As a result, I will say this: DBGT, although not up to its predecessors, but to some extent was able to maintain the atmosphere, the spirit that the original had.That is why the ending of DBGT, the final battle between Super Syn Shenron, I think is the best end of the entire franchise as a whole, so to speak, the result. In Super, not only is there no point, there is no introduction, just like the main part. There are a lot of ideas for implementation, since the Dragon Ball Universe is very plastic, but as long as the authors are led by profit, nothing worth waiting for is worth it. End!', 'I hadn\'t watched anything dragon ball related until this year and i marathoned every dragon ball series. the only breaks I took were when watching some annoying fillers in the original dragon ball and the constant breaks I had to take while watching this show.The best way to describe this anime is with the title of episode 6:""Like Pulling Teeth""  it hurts seeing how they take the characters, world and ideas from the previous stories and just ruin them while desperately trying to recapture what the original and z did.I remember a friend telling me that there was some good things near the end...but it honestly feels like taking out the sprinkles from a poop ice-cream. they still taste like poop because of where they come from.if you want to know if you should watch it to enjoy a show? then the answer is no. if you want to watch it to know what a bad anime is? then go right ahead. but it honestly feels like taking out the sprinkles from a poop ice-cream. they still taste like poop because of where they come from.if you want to know if you should watch it to enjoy a show? then the answer is no. if you want to watch it to know what a bad anime is? then go right ahead.', ""As a massive franchise, Dragon Ball maintained its status as the father of shonen because of its uniqueness, single handedly creating the battle genre. Even with the occasional bumpy rides of Dragon Ball Z (mostly on the Buu Saga), it managed to have an interesting story with memorable moments, about interesting characters. And GT learned nothing from it.Watching the show knowing beforehand that Akira Toriyama only managed the character designs, i was curious of how Toei would guide the story. Short answer; it had great potential, but failed hard in the execution. Leaving few redeeming qualities (one of them being the opening, the best in...the series).The story starts off showing everyone after the end of the original series, it's a great way to start, sure, but right after, the hunt for the black star dragon balls begins, and it's just a more mature morning kid's cartoon, almost as if capitalizing the name of Dragon Ball just so its relevance doesn't die out after the original ended, just so it could putt and sell as much merchandising as possible.The Baby saga is where things start to kick it, it has an overarching plot, so the episode by episode ordeals are left out, but the rest of the story just feels like it wasn't planned out, with predictable writting and poor pacing.In everyway it feels like a downgrade in terms of story; Goku being a child, feels like his progression was haulted with no believable purpose (a character that we are shown every step of his growth from the beginning), the rest of the cast are just a shadow of their former self, only for Goku to safe. Even the SS4 transformation is the least memorable one story wise, no build up like SS1 or SS2 Gohan. The action is pretty generic, with no interesting interactions between the characters.The animation is good, receveing an upgrade, with a more defined line quality and animation. The quality manages to maintain the same throughout, and the characters design are passable, except for SS4, it has a great design, being the only way it stands out from the previous Super Saiyan transformationsCharacter wise, the main trio (Goku, Pan and Trunks) have an interesting dinamic, but nothing really hits home. Especialy Pan, she doesn't have any growth and only causes trouble, we are left expecting in many occasions her moment to shine but it never shows up. Trunks is no better, just forgettable throughout, and overshadowed in the end by literally everyone else.Overall, it feels like a show trying to be and feel like Dragon Ball but not achieving it. Fights and transformations don't cut it, i was not invested because nothing really meant anything, there were no stakes involved in most of the fights, the few good scenes relied on nostalgia (the ending comes to mind), and don't get me wrong, it is a good ending and a fitting one, but the way it reached that point was forgettable and a chore to watch. the series).The story starts off showing everyone after the end of the original series, it's a great way to start, sure, but right after, the hunt for the black star dragon balls begins, and it's just a more mature morning kid's cartoon, almost as if capitalizing the name of Dragon Ball just so its relevance doesn't die out after the original ended, just so it could putt and sell as much merchandising as possible.The Baby saga is where things start to kick it, it has an overarching plot, so the episode by episode ordeals are left out, but the rest of the story just feels like it wasn't planned out, with predictable writting and poor pacing.In everyway it feels like a downgrade in terms of story; Goku being a child, feels like his progression was haulted with no believable purpose (a character that we are shown every step of his growth from the beginning), the rest of the cast are just a shadow of their former self, only for Goku to safe.

"", ""Ah Dragon Ball GT, the series us DBZ fans try to utterly ignore.While it's no secret that DBZ holds a special place in my heart, considering it was the first show that got me hooked on anime.  DBZ had an alright plot, great characters, full of awesome moments, badassery and hammy as all hell, and that's why Dragon Ball and DBZ both have charm, and are beloved by millions.DBGT manages to take such a lofty reputation and do nothing with it.Overall as far as the art, I have no complaints.  It shows a fair grasp of skill and detail, and I wish such...a talented animation team actually created an anime worth watching.Overall, the voice acting is fine.  The characters are recognizable to both sub and dub watchers of the series, which is why I give it a thumbs up.  What brings down the voice acting, in my opinion, is the rather lackluster music.  DBZ and DB had catchy tunes happening in the background, and during epic moments, the music fit and added to the tension of the scenes.I find none of the former in this series.  The best way I can describe the soundtrack is generic.However, these are small fish to fry compared to the biggest, glaring problems that plague this anime.  The plot and characters.If anyone is starting to notice a trend here, I mostly judge a series based on the consistency of the plot, the setting, the pacing of the plot, and more importantly, the characters.While I love the characters in DB and DBZ, as each of them were relatable and enjoyable, even the villains, DBGT takes great characters and puts them in plot that's full of inconsistencies, completely unbelievable, full of comedic moments that just aren't funny, and it doesn't properly build tension leading up to action moments.Speaking of action, let's talk the fights.  They are boring!  There's no impact to any of the punches kicks and such, the transformations are lackluster, and the action scenes lack a proper flow.Anyone learned in action sequences, knows that they have to be entertaining and have an overall flow.  Compare action sequences in DBZ to DBGT.  DBZ has proper flow, tension, and resolution when Goku finally wins.I could go on and on about just how bad this series is, and I have a theory as to why it is as bad as it is.  While the series had great potential to be a different take on the series, the executive producers wanted to milk the cash cow that the Dragon Ball franchise was at the time this was released.  DBZ at the time, was one of the most popular shows on the network, and when the series inevitably reached its end, the producers quickly did a mash up plot to continue making money off the series.Which isn't surprising as Toriyama had no hand in writing this series.  Even he describes it as non-canon.I may be wrong or right about that, but it doesn't stop DBGT being a complete and utter waste of time.Overall, the series gets a 1/10.  The relatable characters and admittedly good animation isn't enough to save the absent minded plot.Watch Dragon Ball, DBZ, or Dragon Ball Z Kai if you want the true Dragon Ball experience.

If Goten did ride that spaceship, hopefully the story will be different and more cooler than this, no cap.Anyway, in the beginning Dragon Ball GT attempted to recreate the feeling that the original Dragon Ball had, but they ultimately failed.

The plot actually has some promise, it\'s a standard ""we have to collect the mcguffins"" plot, but that served to take the show off Earth and show off some new planets. It\'s a shame that none of the ones I saw were very interesting. The new characters are annoying. Pen is a whiny brat and they meet a robot along the way who cannot go two minutes without repeating his name. The returning characters do not get...off light either (without going into spoilers).

In my opinion the saga which followed was not that bad although it could have grown in length by another 10+ episodes giving other characters such as Gohan and the rest a shot or giving meaning to unless Pan other then nagging the entire time, however if you\'ve watched DBZ and DB You\'ll find it nostalgic...and decent for a normal story line.The art was improved as seen by mainly transformations, although don\'t take it the wrong way it was made over a decade ago. The Super Saiyan transformation has at some points really gained that gold glow and the blast such as the Spirit Bomb was fairly good in my opinion even the aura surrounding the characters was powerful for a 90\'s anime. The scenery was fairly good as the Hell setting was much better than in  the DBZ anime well can\'t blame it cause it was filler.While I haven\'t listened to the japanese soundtrack the dubbed version was not that great it didn\'t get you into the moment as when the story ended on the final episode it was a great way to end this anime and the entire franchise, however rock music at most doesn\'t suit well with DB in my opinion.The characters have quiet frankly fallen such as mainly Gohan who was one of my all time favourites he developed from a cowardly shy individual to a beast who and I quoted told Super Buu ""Fight you? no I wanna kill you."", but GT just ruined his character as he got his ass handed to him many times in this series and he wasn\'t a useful character at all. Others like Vegeta, Krillin, Trunks and Piccolo were of no use as well, however it seemed that (Spoiler Alert!!!: Piccolo\'s death actually served quiet the purpose in the following saga and Krillin\'s death which showed the bond between him and 18 as well as giving her a purpose later on). The character who is one of my least favourites is Pan she\'s a nagging and annoying girl that\'s all that can be said who just fills up dialogue.Enjoyment!? Well since I\'ve seen both DB and Z I think that anybody who\'s seen these two won\'t necessarily enjoy this series, but will enjoy it with spare time to just kick back and watch something when these nothing else to do.Overall these are my ratingsStory - 6/10Art - 8/10Sound - 6/10Characters - 6/10Enjoyment - 7/10Overall - 6/10 and decent for a normal story line.The art was improved as seen by mainly transformations, although don\'t take it the wrong way it was made over a decade ago.

And the fact is Goku had to take Dende in order to replace Kami because the fusion between Piccolo/Nail and Kami made the Dragon Balls with red stars useless.2) You can\'t turn into an Oozaru if you\'re watching the Earth, the Moon has special waves which are transforming Saiyajins in Oozaru. If Moon = Earth then Radditz, Nappa and Vegeta would have died when they arrived...on earth because they would have turned into Oozaru in their spaceships.3) The staff forgot the ultimate state, Gohan was, is and always will be in his ultimate form. His ultimate form IS his base form since the end of the Buu saga. All of his powers were unlocked, he\'s always at his max, he could most likely turned into a SSJ again but he wouldn\'t be stronger, only his look would change but his power remain the exact same and on top of that it\'ll affect his life time. So it can make him weaker but there shouldn\'t be any reason for him to use SSJ because like I said he\'s suppose to be at his max already and all of his strenght is unlocked so even with a SSJ4 or 7 or 8 his power should be the exact same. And in GT nobody (old Kai, Gohan himself or whatever) is referring to this form again, nothing is explained and nobody is surprised... It\'s like ""nothing happened"".4) The lack of SSj2 doesn\'t make sense, even for Goten and Trunks. They\'re clearly able to turn into SSJ like nothing and they mastered the SSJ3 in fusion (a fusion that GT forgot...again) and they can\'t use the SSJ2 20 years later? Ok...It seems the others forgot about that form too anyways.5) Villains don\'t keep their bodies in hell, it\'s stated by Piccolo when Vegeta was against Fat Buu so Dr.Gero and Myu can\'t drink wine in hell, can\'t create a second android 17, can\'t bring villains on earth, can\'t connect two androids 17 and they can\'t keep their memories in hell.This whole saga doesn\'t make sense.And on top of that we can see Coola when the villains are coming back next to android 19 (which can\'t be here according to the book \'cause dolls have no soul).6) Another thing, Shenron can\'t turn Goku into a kid again. He can\'t because Goku is stronger than he is, Shenron couldn\'t kill the Z-warriors ennemies or make changes on android 18\'s body for the exact same reason.7) And in SSJ4 Goku\'s adult for no particular reason except for the look but other than that there is no explanation whatsoever.8) The power levels don\'t make sense at all. It\'s creating inconsistencies everywhere. Goku losing to a regular child at the Tenkaichi Budokai doesn\'t make sense and was the most frustrating scene I ever witnessed. GT has inconsistencies and plotholes, and there are too many choices which are wrong and even when they\'re trying it\'s not funny, it was only done for marchandising and for money.9) Plotholes and inconsistencies aside many are out of their characters, Tien and Yamcha at the very end when the Dragon Balls weren\'t here anymore did not help the people, Tien was taking a shower and Yamcha was reparing his bike (from the end of episode 64). Even if they are useless in the context it\'s pretty hard to argue or to prove that at such time they wouldn\'t show up at least to help the GT-warriors (give their strenght) or the regular peoples who were threatened by the fight against Li Shenron. Even in the Baby saga they didn\'t do a damn thing, even if it\'s hopeless Tien\'s character would help in vain (Buu saga for exemple, Fukkatsu no F) same goes for Krillin, Yamcha AND Piccolo.10) Gohan one shoted Piccolo but come on, Piccolo unlike Gohan is still training and it doesn\'t take weeks for someone like Piccolo to regenerate himself and to help the non-Baby elements (what was he doing the whole time?).That\'s the problems I had with GT, then Dragon Ball Super came out and did a worst job in many aspects. Now I look at GT and I\'m like, was it really ""that bad?"". Maybe but the animation was outstanding, the musics were ""ok"" and many fights were entertaining, the series had a different approach and moral than the earlier works and manages to deliver it through an impactful and emotional ending.

If it was just another random anime, it would've been pretty good. But for it being Dragon Ball, it's a mega fail....Is It worth a watch?

I'm not a particularly critical person but I know about GT's reputation, it's hard to miss.While the overall story is lacking, trying to look for a direction to go in and failing most of the time, there are some very good components especially in the Baby Saga. This saga is a huge step up from the black star dragon ball saga and manages to remain tense throughout as you watch Baby become what he swore to destroy (something that the Goku Black arc did later on). The shadow dragons in...the following arc introduced an interesting concept that makes you question the morals of the events of the entire franchise, but is ultimately inconsistent in fighting sequences towards the end. The ending of GT feels undeserved and more like pandering to fans of Z rather than fans of GT, but despite this the ending is admittedly a good one.The Cell animation holds up pretty well, and character designs are actually nice! But at times the character's eyes look distant and.... weird. As much as I love Trunks I really didn't love his vacant expressions and lack of that classic Vegeta Forehead. Goku's face is also pretty inconsistently animated.Pan is pretty annoying to start with, but I think she gets less so as the series progresses. Her relationship with Giru is very sweet. I spent most of the time feeling sorry for Trunks as he had to put up with a little girl trying to prove her worth, and a literal manchild who only thinks of food. He was pretty entertaining but he's been done better. Goku has a pretty distinct disconnect between child form and SSJ4, going from dumbass to serious just from the transformation; the playfulness of Goku is lost in this transformation (but I have to admit when he ate the dragon ball I was laughing). Vegeta was ignored until the end, and I feel like this version of his character is a believable rpogression of his character shown in the Z ending (if a bit too nice, for him I mean).  I also feel like Goten and Gohan got skimmed over, though I can understand why as Trunks is a fan favourite and Pan is a younger character to pass the mantle onto.While this series had some pretty low lows, it was enjoyable to watch when everything  was taken with a pinch of salt. I kept in mind that it wasn't canon and just enjoyed it for what it was. It's not amazing, but I wouldn't say it's as bad as people say. I'd recommend it to people who are into DB and have nothing better to do. The opening is a bop and some of the ending songs are bangers.TL;DR: I thought it was fine with some boring parts, but I'd say don't watch it with a serious look at it. the following arc introduced an interesting concept that makes you question the morals of the events of the entire franchise, but is ultimately inconsistent in fighting sequences towards the end.

Vegeta was ignored until the end, and I feel like this version of his character is a believable rpogression of his character shown in the Z ending (if a bit too nice, for him I mean).  I also feel like Goten and Gohan got skimmed over, though I can understand why as Trunks is a fan favourite and Pan is a younger character to pass the mantle onto.While this series had some pretty low lows, it was enjoyable to watch when everything  was taken with a pinch of salt. I kept in mind that it wasn't canon and just enjoyed it for what it was. It's not amazing, but I wouldn't say it's as bad as people say. I'd recommend it to people who are into DB and have nothing better to do. The opening is a bop and some of the ending songs are bangers.TL;DR: I thought it was fine with some boring parts, but I'd say don't watch it with a serious look at it."", ""Finally got to buy and watch GT. I watched it with my girlfriend and both of us enjoyed the show. I understand how people can be upset about it not being like Dragon Ball Z but I thought it was a good and enjoyable show. The beginning when Trunks, Pan and Goku are in space I wasn't really feeling. After they came back to earth with the dragon balls is when I really started to like the show. There was a ton of action in this show and SS4 Goku was cool. There are a ton of repetitive things though just like there was in...DBZ such as characters saying the same things over again. In DBZ there was always spirit bomb and in GT there is always kamehameha. DBZ such as characters saying the same things over again.

It was easily one of the worst anime I've seen to date. I watched it a few years ago in the hopes that it was better than people said it was, and I almost immediately found out it was even worse. It took me over 3 months to watch it when I would have finished it in a week. It was a slog the whole way through, with almost no redeeming qualities. It tried to recreate the original series but lacks all of the charm, humor, and enjoyable fights. Most...of the events could have easily been left out, as a good 50% of the series felt like filler. It left a nasty blemish on an otherwise enjoyable franchise. of the events could have easily been left out, as a good 50% of the series felt like filler.

As I understand it, Toei Animation tried to link the first two seasons and create something mixed between them, but their work failed miserably. The ""Dragonball with Black Stars"" and ""Super 17"" arcs are rubbish. The rest are a little better, although all arcs contain a number of plot holes and inconsistencies so much that it is impossible to watch with the brain turned on, as everything looks like some kind of circus.Animation.The drawing is worse than it was in the...first season. Everything looks faded, which is why the perception of the picture is almost at zero. Thank you at least for maintaining the style of drawing that is characteristic of the franchise.Sound.I only liked the opening. This is where the good music ends and the garbage wakes up.Character.Here I would like to put 0. Goku was turned into a child, making him retarded, who even forgot about his trademark teleportation technique. Thank you! This is why I hate this season. The rest of the characters are dumbfounded too. Vegeta completely forgot about fusion. Pan is just annoying. Uub is useless. Oh, hello Piccolo and Buu. Goodbye Piccolo and Buu. Baby was the only one I more or less liked, he has at least some charisma. Super 17 and Omega Shenron are empty shells. Even a log like Jiren is more interesting than them.Enjoyment.The first 63 episodes were painful, looked with great difficulty. The transformation process to SSJ4 and the ending of episode 64 is the only thing I really liked, for these moments, I give this season 1 point, without them - 0.

It's the anime that got me into anime, I've been lucky enough to meet 5 of the voice actors for it, I cosplay as DBZ character frequently, and DBZ merchandise is my weakness.What went wrong with GT? Well I've heard that Akira Toriyama didn't write the story, but after some research I've learned that he outlined the story, designed SS4, drew out designs for all the villains and was in fact very involved. There are even quotes from him saying that he enjoys GT. Check out: http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_GT...for more on that.The ideas in GT did have potential (SS4, relationship bonding between Goku and Pan, etc.) However, it just wasn't executed well.So here is what went wrong in my opinion:1.  Goku becoming a kid: I think Goku never should have been reduced down to a child. All throughout DB and DBZ we watch Goku grow. He gets older, stronger, slightly smarter ;P , and he is always moving forward as an individual. He needs keep climbing higher and faster. That's just who he is as a person. So when he gets turned into a kid, that's a huge step back, and it didn't make any one happy.2. Losing the competitive relationship with Vegeta: The friendly/not-friendly relationship between these two Sayain warriors is one of the most iconic relationships in all of anime. Their competition is what drives them to become stronger, faster. The DBZ community loves Goku and Vegeta whether they are fighting together or with one another. So it was a huge mistake to reduce Vegeta down to the level of a supportive character rather than a lead.3. Losing the DBZ family. In addition to hardly any Vegeta, there was very little of the other beloved DBZ characters. Some of them had a few moments, but nothing really worth watching. I know the huge reason I love this anime is for the Z fighter interactions and relationships. I want to be a part of their family. Without them all being together, there is no family for me to want to be a part of.4. Lame fighting. We all know there is nothing like a DBZ fight sequence! They are awesome! GT.....not so awesome. I guess the coolest thing that happened was the SS4 fusion, but it was out of character for Vegeta to transform not by his own power and the fight itself drug on for so long that it almost became boring. Every other fight in the show was predicable and repetitive.I could go on, but these 4 points are what I believed killed the show. If you are watching Dragon Ball Super now you can see that all of these have been corrected which would be the reason for it's success as well as the success of Battle of the God and Resurrection F. for more on that.The ideas in GT did have potential (SS4, relationship bonding between Goku and Pan, etc.) However, it just wasn't executed well.So here is what went wrong in my opinion:1.

I was just coming off the back of DBZ and Super and I actually thought Super was much better than I had been led to believe, so with that in mind, I kept my mind open when it came to taking in Dragon Ball GT.What I witnessed in the first 17 episodes of the show was by far the WORST Dragon Ball content I ever had to sit through.  There were moments, specifically involving the para-para brothers, where I was worried this...would lower my opinion of the entire franchise.  As I mentioned in my DBZ review, I think it's a masterpiece.  This however, is far from it.However the show has one saving grace, one thing, character, that stops it from being complete trash unworthy of being seen by the human eye.  Baby.The Baby Arc in Dragon Ball GT, spanning from episodes 17 to 40, is probably one of the most enjoyable arcs to come out of Dragon Ball since the end of Z.  I enjoyed seeing the familiar faces come back, Baby Vegeta had a cool design, and SSJ4 Goku I think is just really cool.  The Baby Arc is at least at the same level as a Super arc.Sadly, once we get past the Baby Arc, we are once again thrown to the gutters as we have to sit through the Super Android 17 arc.  The best part about the arc is that it's the shortest one only being 7 episodes.  And I must say, I don't think I hate this arc as much as other people do.  It was still better than the Dark Star Dragon Ball arc the show started with.  However, that isn't really much of an accomplishment.So once again, for the next 20 episodes, the show is extremely boring.  The only time that GT picked up again for me was the last 4 episodes, 60-64.  These episodes were very enjoyable to me and the end of the show was definitely something to think about.Besides the Baby Arc, GT has one more thing going for it, the last episode.  In my opinion, the last episode of Dragon Ball GT is a great send off to the series as a whole.  Of course, the main problem with the ending is that it doesn't really have anything to do with Dragon Ball GT.  The only reason I felt emotional watching it was because it was showing me clips from Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, shows I actually DID care about.  Plus Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku is an amazing song.That's another thing that I will give GT credit for, the music is amazing.  Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku is a great opening for the series, invoking a sense of adventure and nostalgia, as if to let the audience know that this is the end of the Dragon Ball story right from the beginning.  Meanwhile once you've finished sitting through another boring episode, you get the treat of watching the credits which ALSO have great music behind them.  Hitori Janai caught me immediately, and Blue Velvet is just as good.Overall, Dragon Ball GT was the worst entry in the Dragon Ball Franchise.  The Baby Arc and final episode were not enough to save the show for me.  I don't think they ever could be.  With the first arc of the show being the most boring schlock I ever had to sit through, and the Android 17 arc being shoved in right when the show would've maybe got good... it's just a trainwreck.  Not to mention the Shadow Dragon arc isn't even good until Omega Shenron appears.So yeah, Dragon Ball GT.  If you aren't a hardcore Dragon Ball fan, or trying to binge watch the Franchise like I was.  Just skip it.  You don't need to watch it at all since Super retcons it.  Peace! would lower my opinion of the entire franchise.  As I mentioned in my DBZ review, I think it's a masterpiece.

But, it has a slow start which already made it pretty boring compared to the likes of Z even from the saiyan Saga let alone its peaks. The main crew is a child Goku, pan and older Trunks basically just running around gathering dragonballs from shallow boring villians.If you're expecting it to start with a main villians being hyped up or introduced clementine in a big fight that formula takes a...while to start up.

It serves as a sobering reminder of how a beloved series may veer off course when its foundations are neglected.There are several and obvious issues with GT. The narrative comes first, and it feels like a clumsy attempt to reproduce the magic of the first Dragon Ball series. Finding the Black Star Dragon Balls is a dull endeavor that lacks the grand scope and significance of its forerunners. The writing of the series reads as uninspired and frequently uses clichés, with fabricated plots and unmemorable villains.Another significant failure is characterization. The...endearing characters from DB and DBZ lose their charm and depth. Goku's transformation into a toddler comes off as a cheap stunt with no real character growth, and the new characters that are presented are at best forgettable.The quality of animation varies and is frequently poor. The exciting and graphically beautiful battles that characterized the series' predecessors are absent. The character designs are drab, and the action scenes lack the fan-expected enthusiasm and vitality.The most aggravating feature of GT may be its unrealized promise. The rich lore and characters created in the prior series may have been expanded upon, but it choose to neglect or improperly handle them. The anime loses the wit and charm that made it so attractive because of the darker, more melancholy tone, which feels forced and out of place in the Dragon Ball universe.In conclusion, Dragon Ball GT is a letdown in practically every way. It falls short of capturing what made Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z so renown. It's a bland and subpar addition to the series that shouldn't have been made, and it serves as a sobering illustration of how even the most adored series may falter when carried in the wrong path. You're better off sticking with the earlier or later series and ignoring this stupid error if you're a fan of Dragon Ball. endearing characters from DB and DBZ lose their charm and depth.

Most my actual memories of GT was with the DBZ games when they would cover GT. So watching this series after so many years, how does it hold up? Honestly? It\'s not that great, not the worst anime I have ever seen and it\'s not 100% deserving of the bad rep it gets but at...the same time, there are a number of issues with DB GT that prevents it from being consistently enjoyable for me. The best way of describing GT is that it feels like an anime where the writing staff was getting fired every couple of episodes and as a result the whole show feels like an oddly disjointed experience and the show does eventually reach a point where I can sit through an episode without asking questions every 10 seconds but at the same time, GT\'s underlying problems still persistent. I will be going over the series Saga by Saga and rating them individually and then giving the series an overall score like past DB anime reviews.Black Star Dragon Ball Saga - 5 out of 10. Jumping into GT right after DBZ and things get jarring right away. So many odd inconsistencies and random jumps from point a to c rather than smoothly transitioning from point a to b to c. First of all, Dende forgets that he has the ability to heal people and literally asks Mr. Popo to give Goku first aid. Then even more questions I start asking, like how did Pilaf and his crew know where the Lookout was? The Lookout was a closely guarded secret and you would have to be an A class detective to figure out where it was, and Pilaf magically knows where it is and even finds the means to get there with everyone smoothly getting past security to boot. This is like the Joker or a Batman villain figuring out where the Batcave was, knows Batman is Bruce Wayne and is able to bypass security with ease and it\'s all done off screen. It doesn\'t even end there, oh no, it turns out Kami had a dark secret with the Black Star Dragon Balls and he never once told Goku or Mr. Popo about it and they are super dangerous yet so easily accessible that Pilaf is able to find it without even looking hard. I know Dragon Ball was never was the most planned series throughout it\'s run but this is just stretching it. Then Goku becomes a kid again because Red Shenron did not know what a figure of speech means. And it doesn\'t end there, after this Roshi is in the city for some reason and Goku decides to randomly eat food instead of going to his family about his problem. What truly annoys me about this Saga is the fact that the whole idea is actually sound on paper but the writers find a way to screw it up with the Z fighters going on a intergalatic space adventure to find them even if the whole story is lacking in agency since no one seems to be that concerned that earth will blow up in a year. Vegeta has to drag Goten and Trunks to go and no one seems to be that concerned overall. But the set up is still there, but the writers lazily write Goten, Vegeta and Gohan out of the story since they didn\'t know how to write a dynamic with 6 characters so they have Pan magically hit the launch button on the ship as if it was easily accessible because someone would design a ship that way. Okay, I ranted on the early episodes of GT enough, but it is so bad to the point where I consider it some of the worst content DB has ever produced. This Saga does get better after this but not by a whole lot, the lack of agency still persists with the show never once keeping track of time to when the earth will explode and they spend multiple episodes wasting time on other planets not even knowing if a year will slowly past by. The adventures themselves are okay and the character interactions are decent enough to get me through it, but the lack of agency still persists. That and I am not a fan of how the series has done the Star Trek and Star Wars thing of having aliens be stand ins for human civilizations like a Space Middle East or Space Native Anericans, it\'s not enough to ruin the series for me, but it tends to be grating when stories do this. The story does start to have more tension and agency when they get to Giru\'s home planet even if General Rildo\'s plan which is really Trunks and Giru\'s plan to figure out Dr. Myu\'s plan can be rather convoluted when you think too hard about it. Goku\'s fight with Rildo was also pretty enjoyable. And well time to time to move on to the next Saga.Baby Saga - 6 out 10. This saga starts off as promising but GT being GT finds a way to make this an idea executed awkwardly. This 6 out of 10 is a generous one. We get introduced to first major overarching villain through Baby, and his abilities are pretty interesting with him being a body takeover parasite, and the early episodes with him are okay even if Baby does come off as a bargain bin Imperfect Cell since they both have a horror gimmick and need to outwit their enemies before they can get stronger, but after the episode where Baby fails to take over Trunks at the Space Hospital, the writing goes downhill almost immediately. After this, Baby manages to learn mind control, get a power increase AND learns where earth is entirely off screen, it almost feels like these episodes were cut out because this can be bizarre, and comes back to my issue of GT feeling it never smoothly transitions from a to b to c. Not only that but while Baby\'s backstory of him being connected to the Sayain race is interesting, it feels like a retcon of sorts because the Tuffles was never mentioned when Dr. Myu was trying to keep Baby alive, and it\'s never explained where Dr. Myu fits with Baby\'s grand design and how he came up with Myu\'s schemes, this is what I mean when GT\'s writers were getting fired every few episodes. Not only after all this Baby manages to take over Goku\'s friends and family and take over the world in a short period of time off screen as well. And my issues don\'t even end here either. Remember how I made a big deal about Dragon Ball\'s use of the worf effect and how important it is to establish how threatning villains are? Well GT, takes this concept and takes away any of the balance Z had. Every character Baby fights gets beaten very easily, Piccolo, Vegeta, Goten, Trunks, and Uub get beaten with ease and it rarely ever feels like Baby could even loose where Frieza, Cell and Buu got push back from the characters I mentioned minus Uub, Baby never once even has a challenge, this is everything people assiocate Z for having but miss the point. As a result everything in this Saga before Super Saiyan 4 gets introduced is dull. I might as well get to that, what pushes this Saga to a 6 and not a 4 or 5 is Super Saiyan 4. I will admit, when Goku transform into the Giant Ape and then Goku realizing he has family and friends to fight for to get him to snap out of it was well done. It\'s one of GT\'s better moments up until that point. Super Saiyan 4 is also one of the better moments of GT because Baby actually is faced with a challenge. From here on out the writing is actually okay, even if it has GT\'s bad habbit of having one sided fights and of course GT\'s really bad habbit where the series even has a on he nose metaphor, of the other characters besides Goku getting ""buried"" in the ground. The ending of the Baby Saga while sound on paper lacks any impact since Piccolo dies in his second appreance and he no showed in the story for quite some time. It lacks any kind of emotional core since Piccolo got one shotted by Baby the last time he was seen before the scarifice. This Saga is saved by Super Saiyan 4 mostly.Super Android 17 Saga - 5 out of 10. Not a whole lot to say on this Saga, it\'s the shortest Saga of GT, and it features all of GT\'s questionable writing antics from the start. How did Gero and Myu was able to hypnotize 17 on Goku\'s earth to being evil? He wasn\'t evil in Goku\'s time and he never killed innocent people, so you would need something great to have him turn evil, and it comes back to GT\'s underlying issues from not smoothly transitioning from point a to b to c. Also, how was Gero and Myu able to build an Android in Hell with recources they had and with Hell being on tight security? How is two 17s stronger than Perfect Cell? I still never understood that. Outside of those issues, the whole Saga feels like a rehash of the DBZ movie Fusion Reborn and it\'s not even handled as in that since it\'s GT being GT, all the characters besides Goku are useless and all they can do is beat up characters that are bigger jobbers than they are. And out of all the villains who come back get beaten really easily and Vegeta\'s reunion with Nappa is less than a minute, if this is supposed to be ""fan service"" it\'s not handled that well. Goku\'s fight with Super 17 is okay and Android 18 does get decent closure here but that\'s the only praise I can give this Saga.Shadow Dragons Saga - 7 out of 10. What? What is this? After all the complaining about GT thus far I am giving it some praise, yes, this Saga is by far GT\'s magnum opus and is the thing that prevents me from calling GT completely ""unwatchable"". The Saga at the start was decently foreshadowed with negative energy making the Dragon Balls crack which already is writing above the standard that GT has shown thus far. I also love the concept on paper, and it feels like the writers were doing a decent job at understanding how overused the Dragon Balls were and how it erased any permanent consequnces the DB series ever had. There is a weird meta involving this Saga and I like it all the more for it. I also like how each Dragon gave Goku a challenge and he had to outsmart all of them in order to win. And while a bit too OP for my tastes Omega Shenron does a good enough job at feeling like the series ""final boss"" of sorts which is rather fitting since much of my exposure to GT was the DBZ games. It does suffer from GT\'s problems of every character besides Goku being one note jobbers, and aspects of it feel rushed like how the Shadow Dragons took over the world, learn their abilites and got personalities in the span of a few hours, but this I can ignore this the actual overall writing feels competent now even I wonder why Bulma couldn\'t make a new Dragon Radar for Goten, Gohan and Trunks to use to help Goku and even Vegeta needing to use Bultz Waves to catch up to Goku was decently foreshadowed and is about as close to interesting characterization for Vegeta GT will ever give.Overall, I get why GT gets it\'s bad reputation but I do feel the Shadow Dragons Saga somewhat saves it and the ending is a better conclusion than what Z provided and it\'s brevity compared to other DB shows is one big reason why I was able to finish it at all. The show is mediocre but not completely unwatchable. the same time, there are a number of issues with DB GT that prevents it from being consistently enjoyable for me. The best way of describing GT is that it feels like an anime where the writing staff was getting fired every couple of episodes and as a result the whole show feels like an oddly disjointed experience and the show does eventually reach a point where I can sit through an episode without asking questions every 10 seconds but at the same time, GT\'s underlying problems still persistent. I will be going over the series Saga by Saga and rating them individually and then giving the series an overall score like past DB anime reviews.Black Star Dragon Ball Saga - 5 out of 10. Jumping into GT right after DBZ and things get jarring right away. So many odd inconsistencies and random jumps from point a to c rather than smoothly transitioning from point a to b to c. First of all, Dende forgets that he has the ability to heal people and literally asks Mr. Popo to give Goku first aid. Then even more questions I start asking, like how did Pilaf and his crew know where the Lookout was? The Lookout was a closely guarded secret and you would have to be an A class detective to figure out where it was, and Pilaf magically knows where it is and even finds the means to get there with everyone smoothly getting past security to boot. This is like the Joker or a Batman villain figuring out where the Batcave was, knows Batman is Bruce Wayne and is able to bypass security with ease and it\'s all done off screen. It doesn\'t even end there, oh no, it turns out Kami had a dark secret with the Black Star Dragon Balls and he never once told Goku or Mr. Popo about it and they are super dangerous yet so easily accessible that Pilaf is able to find it without even looking hard. I know Dragon Ball was never was the most planned series throughout it\'s run but this is just stretching it. Then Goku becomes a kid again because Red Shenron did not know what a figure of speech means. And it doesn\'t end there, after this Roshi is in the city for some reason and Goku decides to randomly eat food instead of going to his family about his problem. What truly annoys me about this Saga is the fact that the whole idea is actually sound on paper but the writers find a way to screw it up with the Z fighters going on a intergalatic space adventure to find them even if the whole story is lacking in agency since no one seems to be that concerned that earth will blow up in a year. Vegeta has to drag Goten and Trunks to go and no one seems to be that concerned overall. But the set up is still there, but the writers lazily write Goten, Vegeta and Gohan out of the story since they didn\'t know how to write a dynamic with 6 characters so they have Pan magically hit the launch button on the ship as if it was easily accessible because someone would design a ship that way. Okay, I ranted on the early episodes of GT enough, but it is so bad to the point where I consider it some of the worst content DB has ever produced. This Saga does get better after this but not by a whole lot, the lack of agency still persists with the show never once keeping track of time to when the earth will explode and they spend multiple episodes wasting time on other planets not even knowing if a year will slowly past by. The adventures themselves are okay and the character interactions are decent enough to get me through it, but the lack of agency still persists.

DBGT takes me to a time when i was still a kid, ive already then watched most of DBZ just following the episodes on the TV. When i first saw DBGT i was always like why does Trunks look so pathetic, why does everything look wrong and so on, i never got the chance to watch all of it aswell or from the start back then.So when i did eventually watch it all online without knowing any of the hate for it i enjoyed it alot, was driven by the story and...i didn't mind all the cringe that much even tho i was feeling it. Some characters i hated and the first half of the show was a bit boring SOMETIMES, not always. So yeah i like DBGT, and as for the whole Dragon Ball story overall i would highly prefer if DBGT was canon and dbs was put aside. And also if the GT ending movie wasn't canon either and GT got some more breathing space, there was alot they could still make of it. It would be much better than dbs and all that cringe. i didn't mind all the cringe that much even tho i was feeling it.

Those who only watched Z might be disappointed.Dragon Ball GT tries to bring back the nostalgia from the time when Goku was a child, introducing classic elements such as adventures in search of the Dragon Balls, a group, new places, and of course, the child Goku. The child Goku is already a disappointment because you would think that when Goku becomes a child, he becomes weaker, but he still transforms into SSJ without any problem, which is unrealistic.I liked Trunks\' personality, but I...didn\'t like his outfit, which looks like that of a rich playboy. His outfit from the end of Z would have been better.Goku maintains the same personality, with obvious differences in his physique.Pan, Goku\'s granddaughter, is the most irritating and annoying character in the work. She is unbearable and spoiled, ruining several good moments in the series and hindering the tension of the fights. Pan could have been a much better character; being Goku\'s granddaughter and having the blood of the warrior race, I think if Goku trained her while venturing in space, she could have turned out better with moments that could be used for a SSJ transformation.Secondly, there are those space dancers who don\'t pose any threat to the group.The anime\'s soundtrack is beautiful and emotional; I highlight ""DAN DAN Kokoro Hikarete ku"" and ""Hitori Ja Nai,"" not to mention the music when he uses the Genki-dama.The iconic transformation of SSJ4 is a beautiful transformation that shows the true natural and controlled form of a Saiyan. The way it emerged is beautiful and emotional because Goku cries upon seeing the state of the planet he protected for many years, which was vital for the transformation to occur.Regarding some villains, Baby is sometimes a bit annoying, but the fights are exciting and destructive, with well-made scenarios and a well-crafted context.Android 17 is a weak villain, but the fight is good, and the anime brings back the same move that defeated an iconic villain from the past.Omega Shenlong is a powerful villain with a cool design, but part of the fight with the fusion is disappointing. I expected a much more serious and destructive battle.The fusion design is quite ugly, and the worst part is how she fights in the battle. It seemed more like a weak comedy show than a serious fight to save the world. It doesn\'t resemble the serious fusion from the movie at all.Despite the excellent villain conclusion, the ending can be confusing for many.But I like Goku reminiscing about everything he went through and saying goodbye.In conclusion, the main flaw of the anime is the lack of development in some fights, story development, and especially character development. didn\'t like his outfit, which looks like that of a rich playboy.

It's been a goal of mine for a while to finally go back and watch it all the way through as an adult, form as unbiased an opinion of it as possible.Long story short, GT was a tale with a lot of good ideas but poor execution.The universe has an established afterlife where people retain their memories, consciousness, and the ability to continue to grow stronger. So the idea...of all the past villains breaking out of hell, stronger than ever, to fight heroes who've gotten older and stagnated a bit in an era of peace? That could be a really great storyline.

Evil dragons spawned from the abuse of the Dragon Balls over the years? If they ever decide to end DB for real... I would love to see that idea revamped with more emotion and just taken a bit more seriously. Because most of the dark dragons were jokes, but what sparked their creation is such a valid complaint. And accidentally abusing a power out of a desire to explore it, always needing to be even more powerful, is such a Dragon Ball thing...I feel like this series could have been done well.

Fuyu no Sonata: Joshou - Hatsuyuki no Negai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7377/Fuyu_no_Sonata__Joshou_-_Hatsuyuki_no_Negai,[]
Ginga Shippuu Sasuraiger,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4244/Ginga_Shippuu_Sasuraiger,"['Sasuraiger might hold the record for the western anime release to go out of print the fastest, being available for less than a month before Discotek discontinued the J9 Trilogy of which this is the final series (though no prior knowledge of the other two shows is required, since they\'re only a trilogy in a loose sense). So the questions fans of 80s mecha shows may be asking themselves are: should you be kicking yourself for missing out, and is it worth paying horrific scalper prices for? Read on and draw your own conclusions.The premise is interesting in theory: turn Around the World in 80...Days into Around the Solar System in 365 Days, then throw in a train that transforms into a giant robot. In practice, the execution is variable. Despite being tasked with travelling to 50 planets (they do eventually explain why the solar system has that many by the 30th Century), it often feels more like a road trip across 20th Century America, with a few stops in the wild west and planets inspired by other countries. There are times when Sasuraiger goes full space opera, and those tend to be fun, but on the whole it suffers from a lack of imagination.The characters are an atypical bunch for an 80s super robot show. There\'s no Earth Defence Force here, and not a Japanese name in sight. You know that one outgoing, happy-go-lucky and perpetually cheerful American character that used to show up in 80s and 90s anime a lot? Everyone in Sasuraiger is like that. They\'re constantly throwing each other a thumbs up, and ""Yay!"" is their version of the Thunderbirds\' FAB. Maybe this is just what Japanese people think all westerners are like. You\'d think this would grate on the nerves after a while, but surprisingly it works.Sasuraiger\'s strongest episodes tend to be those highlighting individual members of the JJ9 team taking part in the journey. Everyone seems to have half a dozen different tragic backstories, since they keep running into ghosts from their past everywhere they go. Thanks to these episodes, and the JJ9 team\'s infectiously upbeat personalities, Sasuraiger was a show that grew on me after its shaky first few episodes.Unfortunately far too many of the other episodes fall into one of two predictable patterns. Either:a) The JJ9 team land on a planet where there\'s local unrest. They\'re immediately held up by a gang of thugs with machineguns who capture them and either try to blackmail them into doing something illegal or threaten to hand them over to series villain Bloody God (the kind of villain who remains permanently concealed in shadow even when he\'s standing next to normally lit people in direct sunlight). JJ9 escape, transform the train into Sasuraiger and kick their butts.orb) The JJ9 team land on a planet where there\'s local unrest. They\'re immediately held up by local law enforcement, who blame them for crimes that happened before they arrived on the planet and arrest them.  JJ9 escape, transform the train into Sasuraiger and kick the butts of whoever really committed the crime.As for the action, it\'s a mixed bag. There are some good battles and chases, but in general the Sasuraiger is too over-powered for the typical thugs to stand a chance against it. The enemies don\'t even start wheeling out their own mechs until half way through the series. Up to that point the hero mech is just stomping on cars and tanks that might as well be toys. After a lengthy transformation sequence, Sasuraiger often lays waste to the opposition all too easily. Also, for a super robot show, it\'s oddly low-key about fetishising its titular mech. It has various weapons, but they\'re deployed with no fanfare; I couldn\'t tell you the name of a single one of its attacks. It may have been trying to ride the line between super robot and real robot a bit, but considering that it\'s basically a transforming Galaxy Express 999 it\'s definitely a super robot.The series does reach a satisfying conclusion, and I waver on whether it\'s a 6 or 7 overall. It\'s a show I chipped away at over several months, but ultimately enjoyed and will probably watch again. In the end though, the mediocre episodes outnumber the good ones. There\'s the backbone of a solid 26 episode series scattered throughout Sasuraiger\'s run, but the other episodes that pad it out to 43 weigh it down.

There\'s no Earth Defence Force here, and not a Japanese name in sight. You know that one outgoing, happy-go-lucky and perpetually cheerful American character that used to show up in 80s and 90s anime a lot? Everyone in Sasuraiger is like that. They\'re constantly throwing each other a thumbs up, and ""Yay!"" is their version of the Thunderbirds\' FAB. Maybe this is just what Japanese people think all westerners are like. You\'d think this would grate on the nerves after a while, but surprisingly it works.Sasuraiger\'s strongest episodes tend to be those highlighting individual members of the JJ9 team taking part in the journey. Everyone seems to have half a dozen different tragic backstories, since they keep running into ghosts from their past everywhere they go. Thanks to these episodes, and the JJ9 team\'s infectiously upbeat personalities, Sasuraiger was a show that grew on me after its shaky first few episodes.Unfortunately far too many of the other episodes fall into one of two predictable patterns. Either:a) The JJ9 team land on a planet where there\'s local unrest. They\'re immediately held up by a gang of thugs with machineguns who capture them and either try to blackmail them into doing something illegal or threaten to hand them over to series villain Bloody God (the kind of villain who remains permanently concealed in shadow even when he\'s standing next to normally lit people in direct sunlight). JJ9 escape, transform the train into Sasuraiger and kick their butts.orb) The JJ9 team land on a planet where there\'s local unrest. They\'re immediately held up by local law enforcement, who blame them for crimes that happened before they arrived on the planet and arrest them.  JJ9 escape, transform the train into Sasuraiger and kick the butts of whoever really committed the crime.As for the action, it\'s a mixed bag. There are some good battles and chases, but in general the Sasuraiger is too over-powered for the typical thugs to stand a chance against it. The enemies don\'t even start wheeling out their own mechs until half way through the series. Up to that point the hero mech is just stomping on cars and tanks that might as well be toys. After a lengthy transformation sequence, Sasuraiger often lays waste to the opposition all too easily. Also, for a super robot show, it\'s oddly low-key about fetishising its titular mech. It has various weapons, but they\'re deployed with no fanfare; I couldn\'t tell you the name of a single one of its attacks. It may have been trying to ride the line between super robot and real robot a bit, but considering that it\'s basically a transforming Galaxy Express 999 it\'s definitely a super robot.The series does reach a satisfying conclusion, and I waver on whether it\'s a 6 or 7 overall. It\'s a show I chipped away at over several months, but ultimately enjoyed and will probably watch again. In the end though, the mediocre episodes outnumber the good ones. There\'s the backbone of a solid 26 episode series scattered throughout Sasuraiger\'s run, but the other episodes that pad it out to 43 weigh it down.', 'Watched March 2023. This review contains no spoilers.A space ""80 days around the world"" with high stakes is a great premise for an anime, and the characters here are presented as so cliché that they\'re fun and likeable from episode one.Unfortunately, the writing and development of the plot is shoddy and while I can excuse most caveats of watching an aging show, there\'s a lot of wasted potential here, in the sense that most issues addressed are superficial and most would-be dramatic climaxes are completely irrelevant to the character development that ensues.When this lack of effort demonstrated by the writing is joined by the...dated and dubious cultural references shoehorned in as an attempt to portray the future descendants of current ethnic groups (was this meant as an inclusive gesture?), I think most viewers will pause and ask themselves why they\'re watching this series.The occasional fun and ridiculous moments coupled with the nostalgic style that Sasuraiger is presented in are the saving grace of  the show, justifying it being watched as a window into what an unexceptional 80\'s anime looked like and thus what the production status quo for the time was.All in all, watchable if curious, detached and critical. And maybe with a couple beers in you. dated and dubious cultural references shoehorned in as an attempt to portray the future descendants of current ethnic groups (was this meant as an inclusive gesture?), I think most viewers will pause and ask themselves why they\'re watching this series.The occasional fun and ridiculous moments coupled with the nostalgic style that Sasuraiger is presented in are the saving grace of  the show, justifying it being watched as a window into what an unexceptional 80\'s anime looked like and thus what the production status quo for the time was.All in all, watchable if curious, detached and critical.

It's one of the rare kinds which gets better with each episode! At first I didn't thought it'd be anything exceptional but it got really great with it's humor and wholesomeness as the episodes progressed! A great show with a lot of laughs and wholesome feeling which is hiding a very cruel world! It gives you the glimpse of the cold blooded world we live in but does not shift it's genre, a thing which I Loved the Most!Although, the last episode was an...exception! It shows the story of a very different cat and a very different owner! But, that doesn't bore you! Rather makes you praise the thought process of the creator and makes you fan!Give it shot!

Gundam: G no Reconguista Movie II - Bellri Gekishin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40890/Gundam__G_no_Reconguista_Movie_II_-_Bellri_Gekishin,"[""Unlike the first film where the artifacts of it being a TV series felt seamless, yeah, this movie felt like an actual compilation of episodes, not a movie. The merch push from the TV show is clearer, especially with the various backpacks G-Self equipped across the film, and there are clear cuts on where the original TV episode ended or ran. It didn't help that the movie felt sluggish at times, both in pacing and in plot.There are times I felt like I should stop watching the movie due to the amount of information dump in a lot of scenes, and times that it...felt like I should watch the TV episode that this part of the movie is based on, and this is coming from the guy that dropped G-Reco as early as around episode 4 or 5! That said, this is one of those films wherein the first viewing puts me off, but later viewings might make it better. felt like I should watch the TV episode that this part of the movie is based on, and this is coming from the guy that dropped G-Reco as early as around episode 4 or 5!
