Osomatsu-san: Hipipo-Zoku to Kagayaku Kajitsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49119/Osomatsu-san__Hipipo-Zoku_to_Kagayaku_Kajitsu,"['This could\'ve very easily been a 20 minute episode. There is constant filler and jokes that stretch on and on and fucking on even though they are not THAT funny and the animation while very good is mostly on the same level as the TV anime.I get it, it\'s the 60th anniversary and they wanted to do something special but...this ""special"" is rather mediocre.It isn\'t all that bad though, the plot is alright and the twist was hilarious. Todomatsu has some really golden moments and even the Riceballs got to shine, ngl I expected them to fade into the background after their screen time...has ran out but it seems like they\'re really commiting to them as permanent tsukkomi characters.I don\'t want this review to be pure bitching as it\'s not a bad movie, but in all honesty I vastly prefer the first movie and Takoyaki Party more. Those two are just much funnier and have better pacing, as well as actually somewhat caring about the story.One last compliment I could give...I liked the setting? It was nice to see them in non-city surroundings. The backgrounds were great (however again, pretty much on the same level as the TV anime) and I liked seeing the detail of the brothers getting more and more tanned the longer they stayed on the island.That\'s all I can say really without revealing major spoilers, again it\'s a fine film but the first is way better. has ran out but it seems like they\'re really commiting to them as permanent tsukkomi characters.I don\'t want this review to be pure bitching as it\'s not a bad movie, but in all honesty I vastly prefer the first movie and Takoyaki Party more.

Naisho no Tsubomi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3641/Naisho_no_Tsubomi,"[""Please don't care my little mistakes around this review :3 !I was looking one anime download page when I saw title &quot;Naisho no Tsubomi&quot;. I wanted to know what kind of anime it is, so I clicked the title and read what kind of story there was. &quot;Fifth graders thinking about pregnancy, period and the strange feeling around boys...&quot; It sounded pretty interesting to me, so I downloaded all three episodes and watched. I guess that fifth graders are little too young to have period and first kisses, but ~Animation style was really cute ! It wasn't the same as almost every anime has...nowadays, it was cute and definitely different. Even if you think it cute, it was sometimes pretty annoying and some face weren't looking right to the moment. Their hair and clothes were cute, mut face... not so cute as I could have thought. But the first kiss was really cute !When I looked the voice actor in MAL, I noticed that there were many good names around. I knew almost all of them, or I have heard their voices somewhere, so it was nice to watch their speak in little different anime. But it was little shame that there weren't backgroundmusic. It would have bring some new atmosphear to this serie.Because of the number of episodes were so small, you really don't get to know all the characters. It is just a scratch. Even if Tsubomi is almost in every act, you don't know what kind of things she really likes or how she became friends with Rea or why she was so good friend with boys. Saya was the only one who you could get known better, but in the end you don't know why she just disappeared sometimes. It would be so much better if there has been some more information about characters.This anime is not really funny. It's hilarious is all about that, that fifth graders are shouting &quot;penis&quot; all over the school. Or that, that Tsubomi is watching her friends tits and thinking why there is hair in the &quot;special place&quot;. But there isn't any other funny things so you can't enjoy it really much.But still, it was some new experience in anime so I just had to give it eight points. And maybe it was that too, that Saya resembled Nadeshiko from Shugo Chara! ? I don't really know, but this was something new for me and I guess that there isn't really much animes, which are similar to this. nowadays, it was cute and definitely different.

Years later, after being bored to death and losing a lot of the anime I want to watch thanks to the closure of MegaUpload (like Digimon Adventure, Emily of New Moon, and live-action With The Light), I decided to seek out more titles and broaden my anime horizons. In doing so, I ran back into this and, seeing how it's only three episodes long, decided to take the plunge...and I came out alive, but with a weird taste in my mouth.Apparently, this is based on a very popular shoujo...manga, and it's about a sweet girl named Tsubomi who's learning about adult things like pregnancy (in the form of her mother getting pregnant), the male and female body (Yes, sex, in the form of a sex ed video being shown to a classroom full of fifth graders), her period, and falling in love. You'd think this would be an almost fan-service free anime, right? Uhh...no.Well, there's definitely no boob-grabbing, undie flashing, or straight out nudity in this show. It's DEFINITELY not a Kodomo Jikan, Mitsudomoe, or Ro-Kyu-Bu (ugh), which I laud them for not becoming, but...it's still very flawed. The show's biggest flaw: the subject matter. Okay, a sex education anime featuring fifth graders? An episode with kids watching a video about sex? What? I wasn't taught this stuff when I was in fifth grade! I mean, I could see this working with teenagers, but...with little fifth grade kids? Seriously? Aren't they a little young to have to learn stuff like that? What the heck were these producers, and the mangaka, thinking?! What the freak?! I honestly don't approve of kids learning about sex at that age. No I do not, though to its credit, it is rather realistic in its portrayal of boys, showing them (or most of them) getting all excited about the video, talking about sex, and shouting the P word (had to deal with this in high school). People, if you're gonna do an anime about sex education, can you at least pick the right AGE in which to show them?! Showing fifth graders this kind of thing is just downright lewd! In fact, I think it should be against the law! I mean, sure if they do experience these things then they have to be told them some time soon, but not like this!Another flaw lies in half of the cast. Now don't get me wrong, I liked most of the cast, like Tsubomi, Saya, Daiki, Yae, and Yoh. In fact, my favorite character out of this entire series is Yoh, and not just because he's voiced by Mitsuki Saiga either (though I do kinda wish he had more lines. He only got ONE LINE in the first episode alone!). The other half...well, I do think Futoshi is a very realistically portrayed boy...though as a fifth grader in general, I can't picture it. I mean, I can understand his behavior if he were a high schooler since, y'know, high school boys nowadays do nothing but shout inappropriate things regarding sex, but has ANYONE ever seen a fifth grade boy act like he does? I know I haven't! I kinda found Rea to be annoying. Seriously, WHO is interested in that sort of thing?! Why is she interested in knowing what a boner is?! She shouldn't be taught that kind of stuff until she's of age! I really didn't like her. But the rest of the cast: approved! *thumbs up*Okay, now that's all the bad stuff (and part of the good stuff). Let's get to the rest of the good stuff, the first being the animation. Sure some shoujo-haters might think it's a bit too sparkly and extravagant and too shoujo, and sure movement is minimal and there are a few still frames, but I never found this to be a problem. It did what it did and nothing more. It's not trying to be anything it's not, and being an OVA, I think it did okay. The music isn't particularly memorable, but it was nice and it fit the show, though I do wish there was an opening and ending theme. I just can't picture anime episodes without proper intro and outro songs and videos. It just seems weird to me. My favorite episode out of all of this has to be episode 3. It did just about everything right, even if some parts of it were a tad cliche. I especially liked the twist at the end. More anime should do stuff like that, though I wouldn't recommend it for all anime.While it isn't great or mind-breaking, Naisho no Tsubomi is a nice little time killer...though stay away from it if you don't want to see fifth graders learning about sex. I don't want to see any more like it anytime soon. manga, and it's about a sweet girl named Tsubomi who's learning about adult things like pregnancy (in the form of her mother getting pregnant), the male and female body (Yes, sex, in the form of a sex ed video being shown to a classroom full of fifth graders), her period, and falling in love.

This was a lot more useful than the book my mom read to me when I was a young teenager.The Story:The story was very good and relatable for me. As, a lot of what happened in there, I can still remember going through pretty well. So it was also pretty nostalgic! The story though isn\'t anything special compared to other animes. To be honest, it really lacks luster. That being said though, I won\'t take back saying the story was very good, because of the type of story it is. Most things like...this are very gross and boring, and I just wanted to get away from all this type of stuff when I was small. Now, I\'m an adult so I might be wrong, but I think this would\'ve held my interest as for every ""gross thing related to growing up happened"" it was paired with cuteness! And extra points for there being a baby and romance! Yes, I was even a hopeless romantic as a child and I always loved babies. But that\'s just me :pI\'ll give the story an 8.The Art:The art was very cute! That\'s the whole reason I watched it! I didn\'t think it would be about puberty, lol. That\'s all I really have to say on it, just understand I liked the cute characters.I\'ll give this a 6The Sound:The sound was okay, just that, I don\'t remember any of the soundtracks though...So I guess another 6The Characters:I felt the characters were really well done, of course, I\'m older now, but I related to the main character a lot concerning somethings, of course, though that\'s all I\'ll say on that :pNow back to the review.The characters all felt like children to me, not like loli\'s and whenever something a bit perverted happened it felt natural as it was. They\'re just human beings going through puberty which anyone can say is rough. Considering this is anime, I was pretty surprised by it. Now, of course, there are some really perverted things concerning two characters. But really, what do you expect from someone that age, it\'s also part of growing up and puberty to think of things like porn. So I wasn\'t to bothered by it. I would\'ve been though if they really lewd the characters.I\'ll give this one a... 7Now, before I get to enjoyment lets talk about the elephant in the room, I left out someone really big, and that is Saya. All I will say is that she is very mysterious and to watch for yourself if you want to know, cause talking about it will just cause spoilers.The Enjoyment:I\'m an adult, so I didn\'t enjoy this as much as I make it out to be. Just I feel this was really well done for what it is, and actually thinking about buying a copy now and saving it for if I become a mother one day. Although I think girls would like this more than most boys, after all, it\'s really cute and mainly deals with what girls have to go through. But there are still things about boys too though.I say I enjoyed this about... hm... I\'ll say a 5Overall:Overall I feel like this short series is amazing for the type of anime it is. For my list, I rated it either a 9 or an 8 due to how impressed I was at it. So I will say a nine here as well. Just understand this isn\'t for everyone and I wouldn\'t really tell someone to go watch it.Thank you for reading my review and have a nice day!

Otogi Story Tenshi no Shippo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/682/Otogi_Story_Tenshi_no_Shippo,"['This seems to be an underrated series.Of course it is not really original, but it is cute and well developed, with beautiful art and really good voice actor/actresses, and nice humor as well. The romance in the series is cutely done and the lack of real violence is a nice turn if you are in the mood of something cute and nonsensical but not outright silly and childish (something the series is not).It is a cute series without being brainless, and with nice and cute characters. A sure watch to lighten up and relax.I sure recommend it. ', ""This is a review of the dubbed version.Tenshi no Shippo, or Angel Tales as the dubbed version is called, is a supernatural, harem, romance series that is the least bit original. However despite the low score here on MAL and an seemingly ugly artsyle, I did find it to be a decent series in the end.Story 6/10The story starts off with this typical loser-guy Goro, who has no job and little money. A rather unlucky young fellow, who doesn't seem to have any promising future. Then suddenly he meets a fortune teller, and before you know it there are three angel girls coming to serve...him as their master. Heard something similar before, perhaps? Well from here on the story is basically about Goro and the increasingly amount of angel girls that come to serve him. Each of the first 5 or so episodes introduces new angels, and after some time there are a dozen of them living together with their master. However, all these angels care for him with a reason, since they used to be his animal pets earlier in Goro’s life. At one point in the series it seemed that the story would take a cliche direction, with some bad guys appearing to fight Goro and his angels, but it never gets that serious, and eventually it goes back to concentrating on the daily life of Goro and his angel girls again.So, what does a guy do with a dozen of girls in his apartment o_O?? Well nothing special really. Buying food, doing the laundry, going to work, and eating together with his 'servants'...all the usual stuff you find in shows like these. There is hardly any fan service or action, and the comedy consists mostly of easy jokes and small misunderstandings, it never goes over the top, like tsundere beating up guy for instance. All the girls really care for their master Goro, and there are plenty of romantic feelings developing, though it never becomes too serious. 'Calm and cute' is what best describes this anime, and personally I liked it that way.Characters 5/10Since there are plenty of characters and only twelve episodes, there is not much time for any character development. Goro the main protagonist stays the same during the whole series. He's your typical loser-kun, who cares about his angel servants. A kindhearted guy that often is indecisive with the girls, but determined to protect or help them whenever there are troubles.As for the angels, they each have their own personal trait, since they all used to be different animals earlier. Some of them are small girls, and their affection for Goro is more like that of children, where they look upon him as a father like person perhaps. Then we have those who are about the same age as him, and it’s mainly these girls that are romantically involved (in one episode there's a childhood friend romantically involved as well). But the angel girls and all other characters are quite simple and two- dimensional, you don’t really get to know them well. Sure, some of the girls get more screen time than others, but that's basically just to even further express their already obvious feelings for their master. Everyone loves Goro, simple as that.Animation 4/10The artstyle is very simplistic. The character design looks average and pretty much the same for all the characters. What separates them from each other is hair colour, body size and clothing, other than that they share about the same face and facial expression most of the time. The background aren't put much detail into either, with simple colours and little variation.Also the animation is below average. Characters stand still when talking, and sometimes when they turn their face it looks out of proportion. But since there isn’t much happening anyways, you won't notice this so much, except during maybe one episode where there is some fighting.With all this said though, the animation really isn’t that bad, there are worse animated shows out there (ever seen Hanaukyo Maid-tai? Ugh...)Sound 8/10The OP has a positive and catchy tune, where all the girls are singing what sounds almost like a parade song. It’s damn nice, actually one of better opening songs I’ve heard in a while. The ED has a calmer tone, with melody from a harmonica. It’s the same song that you will hear Goro play several times on his own one, so guess you can also call it the main soundtrack, since there are hardly any other soundtracks. I think this is a good thing, since it suits the mood to be more silent when the characters are talking and such. No complaints about the voice actors either, they did a decent job with the dubbing.Enjoyment 7/10The romance was what made this series enjoyable for me. Seeing the angel girls wanting to get attention from Goro, and hearing how they care about him was pleasant. Occasionally nothing really happens, and it might get a little repetitive and boring, but at least there are no annoying moments with over the top comedy. I rather prefer it like this, where the characters are talking and acting in a more relaxed way, not doing all those crazy stuff you would see in other slice of life harem series like 'Hayate no Gotoku' or 'Koi Koi 7'.The episodes with the 'bad angel guys' were totally uninteresting, so during those episodes I felt pretty bored. Actually the only thing that I did find entertaining was, as mentioned, the romantic harem elements of the show, and fortunately that's what the story focuses on most of the time.Overall 6/10Overall I can say that as a harem fan, this was a good enough anime for me to bother finish. Calm and relaxing, where everything is quite simple to follow... sometimes I just feel like watching these shows in between all the bigger series out there, and Angel Tales was a nice little watch that didn't take much of my time. What drags down is the animation and those girls that hardly got any screen time, otherwise this could have gotten a 7 or 8... I recommend it for all those who like series with plenty of girls wanting the attention of a guy, and who doesn't need comedy or action to be entertained. him as their master.

It's just that. No huge plot-twists, no useless drama, useless elements, nothing. It's just a king of a harem anime.Shortly put, our story starts with Goro Mutsumi, a young man with a bad luck. In his past, he took great care of lonely, stray, wounded pets, (in total 12 of them) and they wanted to repay his kindness by being his guardian angels. Simple, no?Art is nothing outstanding, since it was a 2001 anime, still it was not outdated for it's time. Bandai Visual was lovely again.Sound, this is where...anime goes north and south. Pros, some of the angel's voice actors was good and elegant. Some of the angel's... well, was not on the spot. And Goro's acting... I do know it was low on budget and it's kinda hard to find actors for all the 12 girls, so I'm letting it pass. Opening was mediocre, ending was pretty good. I downloaded it to my phone and still listen to it.Character, this is where Angel Tales shines... yeah no. Like I said, it's a simple harem anime, and with 13 characters, it's clear that one can't develop characters. It's just Goro was a real good guy and remained that way the whole time.Enjoyment-Overall: Well, it should be clear now that Angel Tales is a simple anime. And other than increasing the girl's number in the harem, it was nothing new. Still, the anime was full of little things that made you love it; like Goro's harmonica, or finding out that he wasn't a pussy despite his first appearence (that was a relief for me, first impressions are bad indeed) or Goro's father's last bow to the girls in episode 12. Anime was full of those little things, and it kinda made you attached to it. Of course it had it's bad moments, but pros over cons with this anime.If you like harems, go for it.

Having said this, it’s good to note that this show is pretty much a copy cat of every other harem out there. The story line is not that much different then all the others and it gets hard to keep things in line with 12 girls all over the place. It was hard to keep them all straight though because it seemed that there were more characters coming out of the wood work as the story went on. I don’t want to have to have a list with every...girl’s names and animals in front of me when I am trying to watch it. There is a reason why this show isn’t fully well known.Goro is so bland that he just makes it hard to feel for the guy. There really seems to be no personality and is completely shallow and he can’t even feel for the girls feelings at all. Even the girls talk about this in part of the show as his screen time seems to be cut down as more girls come in.The girls… I can pretty much pick out one piece of their personality and use that to give them a name. Seriously, when you’re going to do a harem anime, limit the characters down to at least 6 or 7. Not a whole 12! I mean, it doesn’t even make much sense, it would of made more sense if it was the twelve Japanese Zodiacs instead of us getting the frog, the gold fish, the hamster and so on. Then it would work much better to the story of the 4 gods.The art style is alright, though it felt like the characters have rather flattened heads; especially when they look right at the camera and when they turn, their heads seem oblong too. It’s well… mediocre at best. I’m not sure what the artist was trying to do but it’s not really well done.The music was alright, though a bit tinny and music box-ish. The other music really does not stand out except for one song they play over… and over… and over… and over… again. It’s annoying and I felt like having a drinking game to that song, it happened so much.I mostly only watched if for the story line that seemed a little different then the other shows. girl’s names and animals in front of me when I am trying to watch it.

Reading the information the case provided (about the boy\'s dead pets coming back to him as ""servant"" angels) intrigued me. I\'m not often a fan of harem anime, but this sounded like a legitimate storyline, original even.So I picked it up. It was cheap, so why not. The first volume (that I bought) was only four episodes, so I watched those. The music was decent, I thought, even if the art...or harem-likeness wasn\'t anything to rave about. The major thing that bothered me about this series was just one thing. Just one: the end of the first episode felt like it should have been the end of the series.He\'s reunited with his pet, they\'re loving toward one another, all is right...it seems like an amazing endearing short story. And it would have been quite well-off. But no, someone decided that it had to continue. That it had to introduce even MORE pets, and had to be a harem anime. This was the fatal flaw. You see, once they crossed that path, the whole series fell apart.Now, don\'t get me wrong. It\'s a cute idea in theory, and not the worst anime out there. But if you\'re thinking of purchasing this anime...don\'t. Unless, I suppose, you really like it. But if harem/ecchi anime are your thing, there are ones that are much better made. or harem-likeness wasn\'t anything to rave about.

I found tenshi no shippo quite enjoyable and nostalgic.It is about a young man named Goro who is your typical kind harem protagonist. He is a loser who recently lost his job and quite unlucky but his luck starts to change when he meets three beautiful girls who turns out to be his guardian angels. We later find out the the girls are reincarnated versions of animals Goro helped or took care of in the past so they decide to repay...his kindness by being his caring guardians. He then meets more guardian angels who live with him and serve him. Plot wise it is decent but it gets repetitive and boring. The art is fine for an old anime. Even though the plot and art was not as good as I wanted it to be I still enjoyed it because it's not like normal harem romcoms which focuses too much on echii or on typical characters but don't get me wrong I normally enjoy harem romcoms. Tenshi no shippo won't make you laugh out loud or drown you in echii fan service but will give you a light heart warming harem that will give you a pleasant change to your typical harems. his kindness by being his caring guardians.

Night Head 2041,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43767/Night_Head_2041,"[""Night Head 2041 (2021)What a show, inspired me to watch the original show now.Things of note:Episode 4 has a real nice siren sound use that really makes you feel the effect of the emergency.The OST is spectacular especially the piece Sacrifice. Has the real classical emphasis on it....The show also doesn't have too many 'ahhhhhh' scenes.The story at first I was unsure about but it definitely has become spectacular by the end especially with coming full circle. You get some unexpected situations during the show that really push you back into your chair.The art for this show is brilliant. Characters and many effects use CGI and backgrounds are a mixture. I honestly think it is great to look at and will really stand the test of time superbly.The sound is the best part and I don't mean the OP and ED of which are both good, I mean the SFX sound and the composed music to lift you into every situation are just so powerful and do such a great job.The characters are 2 sets of brothers both with roles to play. Most other characters also have roles to play but they are the most seen. Shouko Futami is a really complex character since she is at the forefront of the story itself. I honestly think she was superb even with her underlying tones of knowing it really is goodbye in some cases to who can or cannot exist.The show was superb in the end, the first episode and I mean maybe 10 minutes of it had me hanging a bit but then it really caught me. I think for me this is the best show of the season that I have seen. I obviously didn't watch every show that came out.Also, Shouko Futami is the best girl and not just because of her character design with that unusual hair style but her entire characters story and her voice are so superbly chosen.9/10.

On one hand you can create a really good looking fight scene, or make a scene pop out and make it breathtaking. On the other if you entirely use CGI in a 12 or 24 episodic series you can end up with varied results. Night Head 2041 is one of those series that does end up using CGI in a well used and ok'ish way.Action and fight scenes are well played and bring out a lot of visualization to what's going on, characters are really well made and actually make...them more interesting to look at instead of a boring model with shades, and to top it all off, the environment in this world almost looks movie- like.I'm no movie critic or someone who can call themself having a good sense of judgement of what's good or bad anime, but i think it's safe to say this will be a series i'm gonna be enjoying to the end.Really and truly i don't actually mind the CG, it makes the series all the more interesting.

Such example of this are the Beastars and Ajin series, which is also something that this anime manages to pull off, if not better.Not to mention, most of the scene transitions from CGI to 2D are actually really smooth and subtle. Almost imperceptible if you're watching this to enjoy it, instead of looking for every single crevice to critique. Whether...they will retain these qualities or not in the future will be another different debate altogether. But for now, it's only fair for me to give kudos to the studio and the animators.When it comes to the story, the blunt exposure at the start of the story immediately gives you a solid world-building on what the plot revolves around. But what distinguishes this anime from other anime that uses the same type of introduction, is that it provides a clear direction in which the story is going. Furthermore, the unique characteristics and circumstances of each character and the relationships they have with one another will inevitably lead to some interesting conflicts down the road. As a result, the way that the story will develop is surely going to be an exciting one, giving you that sense of curiosity and eagerness to come back for more episodes in the future.Thus, from my conclusion, I can assume that this series has an enjoyable experience if you're willing to overlook the fact that they used CGI. This concludes my review. Thank you for taking your time to read this, and have a nice day. they will retain these qualities or not in the future will be another different debate altogether.

While I was hesitant to watch the anime due to it using CGI, but I quickly changed my mind after the first episode and caught me by surprise. The CGI is used properly and mixes well with the action! Sometimes the CGI can be jarring but the majority of the time It's good.The sound, SFX and music are not out of place and mixes well with what's happening and keeps on giving me goosebumps. Very pleasant!Some of the characters are interesting, and the other ones feel kinda...bland at the moment, but that is expected since It's only been 4 episodes.The action so far has been a delight to me and I love the double brother characters. Looking forward to more episodes! bland at the moment, but that is expected since It's only been 4 episodes.The action so far has been a delight to me and I love the double brother characters. Looking forward to more episodes!"", ""I expected another Ex-armInstead I got Akira that was just way too much on the nose.(And worse in every other aspect as well)At first I thought it would be a political story considering the genre, but then it suprised me when the show started inclining towards more religious route. In the second half it went back and connected it with the political aspect.Don't get me wrong. In it's core the idea is decent enough to follow and expand upon. The problem lies with its terrible execution and abysmal handling of its own characters. If you can even call them that.Show started in...a rather mysterious way with too much exposition. Exposition that will keep on not only repeating but also multiplying. I mean, why would you even relay an information to your brother that he has already been well aware of for MANY years ? Like he gets it. The water is wet and our parents are sacks of shit. Shocker.Instead of slowly explaining the themes and meanings of the show, the story just drops everything on you in one episode out of utterly nowhere. Up until that you could have interpreted it in couple of ways and theorize about your own possible interpretations.. But worry not ! There is no longer any need for using any percentage of your brain power. It could have been handled so much better. The entire thing was just couple of dudes sitting in a room and explaining what the story is about. What an easy way out of good writing.The other thing that really grinds my gears is the Noah's ark bit.Ark, rapture, dying for sins of humanity, return of Christ, crusifixion and all the other good christian stuff can be found in here. But Noah's ark showcases a big problem with the show. Instead of remaining as a painting in the big exposition scene, the show later draws attention to its own symbolism and that just makes me role my eyes. Don't tell me. I get it. I get the meaning. Why do you have a need to explaing everything ? Just shut up you. Leave something to my imagination. I know this feels like a minor thing but like I said. Its like this the entire time.Of course its capitalism that gets the most amount of shit. I was suprised that the word capitalism wasn't actually mentioned. Words like competition, equality and new version of the word materialism get mentioned all the time. And its pretty obvious on whose side the story is considering what religious figures represent each side. I liked it more when there were subtle mentions of war in middle east (that is still going on in 2041(cringe) ) and ways how China and Usa distabilize those regions. Not that I disagree with criticism of capitalism but it could have been handled better. Just because I agree with some of its messages that doesn't mean it makes for a good show. For a while I also got the feeling as if atheism was getting blasted as well but I don't actually think its atheism itself. More like the act of not believing in utterly anything. Neither God/s nor reincarnation or not even something like nature. More than atheism it was criticising Nihilism. Some of its better ideas felt like an afterthought. I actually really like the ending to the Prophet character.Overall it was as if the author thought of ideas and messages they wanted to put into their story and instead of actually making a story they made a numbered list of why this and this is good or bad.The characters are utterly laughable. Well I would laugh if there was something to actually laugh at. They don't exist. There is not a single thing I can tell you about them other than the brothers like each other. And even those very strong bonds are showcased to us by the brothers calling each others names from a long distance. But trust me. They have like really strong bonds. But you don't wanna know about it here. It's something really special. They're not your usual brothers. They care about each other.With that said. I still ship the blue haired brother with the brother of the pink haired guy. You know ? The black haired guy. I thought they were about to kiss at some point and like a droplet of blood actually started pumping through my veins only to have been wasted on nothing.Also the designs. I know that rule of cool stands but since I am already at it I might as well mention it. An authoritarian world that supresses not only religion but also fiction and music has no absolutely no reason to allow its poster boys to wear such punk inspired clothing. Punk has always been going hand in hand with anarchism. Which is absolute opposite of what the government wants. Because you know....they want to keep on existing.Also why do the soldier uniforms glow in the dark in such vibrant colors. Or why make them glowy at all ?!Art is fun to look at. Might take a second to get an used to. But once you do its pretty ok. I actually like it. Reminds me of Dorohedoro. Sad thing is that it is so forgettable because of its lack of important and memorable character moments.I really love the voice acting. Its filled with well known voice actors. Feels like home right away if you are familiar with them which you probably are. Too bad they had such terrible script to work with.The dialogue is bad. Very bad. I refuse to elaborate.Night Head 2041 was many things. But let it be know that it was not boring. I had fun. Wasn't enjoying myself. But I had fun. If you are going to watch it remember that it DOES NOT care about its own characters. But only themes and messages. Which they also don't really do a good job of presenting. They do this coming full circle at the end but its just not earned at all.At least I learned something about how not to write a story. a rather mysterious way with too much exposition. Exposition that will keep on not only repeating but also multiplying. I mean, why would you even relay an information to your brother that he has already been well aware of for MANY years ?

What an easy way out of good writing.The other thing that really grinds my gears is the Noah's ark bit.Ark, rapture, dying for sins of humanity, return of Christ, crusifixion and all the other good christian stuff can be found in here. But Noah's ark showcases a big problem with the show. Instead of remaining as a painting in the big exposition scene, the show later draws attention to its own symbolism and that just makes me role my eyes. Don't tell me. I get it. I get the meaning. Why do you have a need to explaing everything ? Just shut up you. Leave something to my imagination. I know this feels like a minor thing but like I said. Its like this the entire time.Of course its capitalism that gets the most amount of shit. I was suprised that the word capitalism wasn't actually mentioned. Words like competition, equality and new version of the word materialism get mentioned all the time. And its pretty obvious on whose side the story is considering what religious figures represent each side. I liked it more when there were subtle mentions of war in middle east (that is still going on in 2041(cringe) ) and ways how China and Usa distabilize those regions. Not that I disagree with criticism of capitalism but it could have been handled better. Just because I agree with some of its messages that doesn't mean it makes for a good show. For a while I also got the feeling as if atheism was getting blasted as well but I don't actually think its atheism itself. More like the act of not believing in utterly anything. Neither God/s nor reincarnation or not even something like nature. More than atheism it was criticising Nihilism. Some of its better ideas felt like an afterthought. I actually really like the ending to the Prophet character.Overall it was as if the author thought of ideas and messages they wanted to put into their story and instead of actually making a story they made a numbered list of why this and this is good or bad.The characters are utterly laughable. Well I would laugh if there was something to actually laugh at. They don't exist. There is not a single thing I can tell you about them other than the brothers like each other. And even those very strong bonds are showcased to us by the brothers calling each others names from a long distance. But trust me. They have like really strong bonds. But you don't wanna know about it here. It's something really special. They're not your usual brothers. They care about each other.With that said. I still ship the blue haired brother with the brother of the pink haired guy. You know ? The black haired guy. I thought they were about to kiss at some point and like a droplet of blood actually started pumping through my veins only to have been wasted on nothing.Also the designs. I know that rule of cool stands but since I am already at it I might as well mention it. An authoritarian world that supresses not only religion but also fiction and music has no absolutely no reason to allow its poster boys to wear such punk inspired clothing. Punk has always been going hand in hand with anarchism. Which is absolute opposite of what the government wants. Because you know....they want to keep on existing.Also why do the soldier uniforms glow in the dark in such vibrant colors. Or why make them glowy at all ?!Art is fun to look at. Might take a second to get an used to. But once you do its pretty ok. I actually like it. Reminds me of Dorohedoro. Sad thing is that it is so forgettable because of its lack of important and memorable character moments.I really love the voice acting. Its filled with well known voice actors. Feels like home right away if you are familiar with them which you probably are. Too bad they had such terrible script to work with.The dialogue is bad. Very bad. I refuse to elaborate.Night Head 2041 was many things. But let it be know that it was not boring. I had fun. Wasn't enjoying myself. But I had fun. If you are going to watch it remember that it DOES NOT care about its own characters. But only themes and messages. Which they also don't really do a good job of presenting. They do this coming full circle at the end but its just not earned at all.At least I learned something about how not to write a story."", 'As a whole, I feel like this anime is underrated. It gives a good message of people having roles in life and how it can influence those around them. Though, it does have its weak points.I feel like this anime was mainly showing off the capabilities that 3D animation could do; the animation was clearly the show’s strongest suit. The animation quality amazing and it’s such a shame that people look down on this anime because of its animation. I feel like it’s really the best 3D anime so far.The anime’s weakest aspect is the story. There were many instances where the story was confusing...or not very consistent like with the sudden drop that everyone has psychic powers and the craziness that was episode 7. I know it’s hard to condense a long story into a seasonal show and there should’ve been a lot of consistency to explain everything, but I feel like George Iida didn’t really do that in this iteration of Night Head.The characters were either enjoyable or not. I enjoyed watching the Kirihara brothers trying to find a place in the world only to realize that the world they live in isn’t theirs. Their connection with the Kuroki brothers made the mystery very engaging. Naoto and Naoya’s bond is very wholesome to look at. Takuya and Yuya were enjoyable to watch towards the end of the show, but they were very frustrating in the beginning, especially Takuya. Fortunately, the Kuroki brothers were redeemable by the end.The mystery behind Shoko Futami was also very intriguing. I wanted to know what role she played in all of this every time she appeared and her end was a very satisfactory one as she finally did fulfill that role.The side characters are divisive to me. On one hand, the side characters that aren’t a part of the SWE are fun to watch while the ones in the SWE were a bore. Characters like Miki, Masayuki, Yui and Kazama were all interesting to watch given their role in their story whether it be their connection with Shoko, their being an anomaly to society or how the depravity of the world twisted them. It really gives off the core themes of the story well.The losers from the SWE, on the other hand, are such a bore to watch. Michio and Reika are not very developed and not very interesting. They just exist to be the Kuroki brothers’ allies. Michio’s rivalry with Takuya felt one-noted and his desire for power was very hypocritical with how he’s persecuting his own people. Reika was like the snarker to Michio’s antics, but the way she suddenly becomes chummy with Takuya and calls him “Taku-nii” like he’s her brother felt kind of weird. I know it’s out of friendly affection, but it really has no importance, as Reika and Takuya’s relationship isn’t really fleshed out.Heck, the villains of the anime aren’t that compelling either. We’ve got Honda who was suspicious from the get-go, but turned out to be a disappointing villain. Kimie, who was ambiguous, ultimately held back on being a threat. Okuhara suddenly showed up as the prophet and decided to destroy the brothers felt out of place as the story never foreshadowed having a prophet. Kazama was the most interesting “villain” of the show and he dipped out after two episodes. Imagine being less interesting than a character that dies in two episodes.Heck, I feel like the main villains of this story are Misaki and Mikuriya for they were the ones that made Naoto and Naoya take on a role they never asked for or wanted. The fact that they had to accept this fate really did seem as if Misaki was the true “villain” as he got his way in the end and overcame Okuhara.The soundtrack and the voice acting were amazing, however. The chemistry between the voice actors is top-notch. I’d love to see Daisuke Ono and Nobunaga Shimazaki play brothers in another anime show, same with Takahiro Sakurai and Kensho Ono.  The show had a lot of well-known voice actors play supporting roles, and I felt like they did a great job. Some of the characters had voice actors that are not as well-known in the industry like Shoko’s but I think they deserve praise. Everyone played their roles to the upmost potential and it felt like they were alive.The anime is pretty and all and if one were to rewatch it, it’d be for the graphics and character designs and not the story. It’s not a bad thing to watch an anime for those aspects, however. The anime was creative, however, with it being one that didn’t stick to a norm. or not very consistent like with the sudden drop that everyone has psychic powers and the craziness that was episode 7.

say that i was having it under my radar since the anouncement of his release when i watched the teaser but it took me a little bit of time to actually watch it.This is gonna be my humble opinion about it and im gonna compare it with his predecesor in some areas wanting to bring to those who until now didnt hear any about it and were planning to watch it (or already did it) the approaching of this new installment in...how good or bad was.This is not an secuel of the original series and neither is an remake of any nature but an reinterpretation with the inclusion of many new elements that in many ways tries to adapting the original story with the inclusion of complete new characters that takes an good chunk of spotlight even going so far to say that to an degree taked the same (if not more) screen-time than our main protagonist this time with characters like kuroki yuuya and kuroki takuya (who wasnt in the original one) , differents settings and an direction that although respect most of the main plot desviate just because the incorporation of so many new cast.I could see the direction in which they wanted to take this series trying to appeal maybe an more broad audiencel, because though i can see that keeped many of the origins and events in this series with our protagonist kirihara naoto and kirihara naoya (that had an completly new design btw ) and we can see them from the begginig, the pacing was too fast almost aboviating many things going straigh to the point and is due to the narration that had in comparision with his predecesor an more accelerated and less darker one losing many subtleties in how was told and really in this aspect the attention span that they might had in mind when they were making this series was probably focused to people who was declining to an much more aciton based series with some touches here and there of mistery.There is always an lack of good narration and compressed many revelations in just one episode which makes it confusing and pretty clear how little importance and care had in the mistery aspect and overall plot.Many could attribute this faults to his format of 12 episodes but the reality is that if you see it can realize how at his core wasnt pretending nothing very elaborate but rather simple from the beggining.Character development was ok with at least our four protagonist because the rest of the characters mostly were discarded without any proper treatment  and used just to serve some purpouse to move with the plot, which also leaves to the next thing many key characters like misaki for example were just mentioned a couple of times and just like most of the elenct in this installment everything just handle really superficialy wihtout to much though about it.To newcomers who never heared about night head i think gonna find very interesting the overall premise to even some going too far to say that was very good or amaizing  but i would reccomend you after you finish this one to give it a try to the old one (night head genesis) so you can grasp  the charm and the essense that was lost in this new installment.What i find very strange was the use of cgi which in general terms was good (making me to remember another series like ajin or knight of sidonia) with 2d animation and i say this because in many scenes there are times were our protagonist are in cgi and intereacting with another character that its 2d feeling pretty off in my opinion i mean in both cases the quality if not bad but not the most smart decision if you ask me.Sound wise worth to mention the sound effects are dope as f@ck there are a couple of them that just sound epic like the sirens or the power itslefts and the quality is top notch, the ost was mehh not bad neither good the op and ending was good though.RESUMENigh head 2041 in general terms is an decent series that although might not be close to the old one (night head genesis) losing so much of what made the series good wasting to much of the story with a pretty fast pacing and focused in the action for most of the time which leaded to a pretty confused narration and dissapinting way on not only handling key character but also giving them a proper screen-time yet managed to hold an good quality in the animation and at least in general terms was enjoyble although i could reccomend that when you finish it give it a try to his predecesor and see how much of a difference are in between these two. how good or bad was.This is not an secuel of the original series and neither is an remake of any nature but an reinterpretation

Merc Storia: Mukiryoku no Shounen to Bin no Naka no Shoujo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37232/Merc_Storia__Mukiryoku_no_Shounen_to_Bin_no_Naka_no_Shoujo,"[""Dear readers, dont let the overall score make u miss this amazing journey, if you enjoy fantasy and advanture, this show is actually one of the best of his kind.I'm actually questioning who's voting and if these idiots watched at least 1 min of the show.When I'm saying this is one of the best show of his kind I'm taking in consideation all my list of anime and manga, my opinion might actually be a little bios considering i grow up watching anime like digimon, pokemon,... in fact this show reminds me of a little bit of them (minus the the action, which is not...that important as much the journey and the growth of our main protagonist).Story (8):In a world where magic and monsters exist, life got better thanks to mages called healers, which have the ability to calm down monsters and make them friendly.Our main protagonist Yuu, has the same ability as is father, the first episode like usual, introduce us to the world we are about to explore and in part tell us why Yuu starts his journey and why he s scared of monsters (not implicit, I got to that conclusion after finishing the first episode, everyone can come with their own conclusions, is not that important for the enjoyment of the show).Art (9):The art is really beautifull, we have some pastels drawnings in a lot of episodes, nevertheless is always consistent and breathtaking on most of the scenaries and monsters scenes.Sound (9):Very fond of the intro/outro music and the choice of the background music, also I kinda feel the voice actors do and amzing job to interpret all the cast.Characters (8):- Yuu is our main protagonist which we will follow trough his journey, he has the ability to heal, he s also very timid around people and dont like to show his ability around them, for some reasons he s scared of monsters.- Merc is a special monster that is gifted fom his father, we dont know nothing about her, that's why she wants to travel to find clues about her past and who she's. She's, on the contrary, full of herself and put Yuu most of the time in troubles.Enjoyment (9):This is really a charming anime, every episode is captivating and makes you intrigued for the next one, It s' really all about the journey, the interactions between characters and the eventual growth, and realization of the objectis of the main characters.Altough i love shounen, martial arts and action anime and manga, I cant stop myself from watching this show, that's why even tough it has little if not none of the genres i like the most I find this show strangely captivating, beautifull and relaxing.Hope I change few of your minds and make you give a shot of this one.Thanks for reading. that important as much the journey and the growth of our main protagonist).Story (8):In a world where magic and monsters exist, life got better thanks to mages called healers, which have the ability to calm down monsters and make them friendly.Our main protagonist Yuu, has the same ability as is father, the first episode like usual, introduce us to the world we are about to explore and in part tell us why Yuu starts his journey and why he s scared of monsters (not implicit, I got to that conclusion after finishing the first episode, everyone can come with their own conclusions, is not that important for the enjoyment of the show).Art (9):The art is really beautifull, we have some pastels drawnings in a lot of episodes, nevertheless is always consistent and breathtaking on most of the scenaries and monsters scenes.Sound (9):Very fond of the intro/outro music and the choice of the background music, also I kinda feel the voice actors do and amzing job to interpret all the cast.Characters (8):- Yuu is our main protagonist which we will follow trough his journey, he has the ability to heal, he s also very timid around people and dont like to show his ability around them, for some reasons he s scared of monsters.- Merc is a special monster that is gifted fom his father, we dont know nothing about her, that's why she wants to travel to find clues about her past and who she's.

Well look no further, Merc Storia is the anime for you!Plot (3/10):The story is about a boy setting out on a journey to recover his water fairy memories. Well not really, it’s an excuse for them to travel around the generic fantasy world to help people because plot. As a result the premise is really weak and aimless.The story follows a episodic monster of the week format, where each storyline  revolves around some annoying, little girl or some misunderstood monster.Characters (1/10):I find all the characters to be annoying, one dimensional stereotypes, so...I never bothered remembering any of their names.The MC is a healer who’s a coward and afraid of monsters. He really needs to grow some backbone. He doesn’t have to help anyone if he doesn’t want to, however it feels like he’s being pushed into everything by the fairy.The fairy in the bottle is annoying and useless.Toto is useless throughout the series.Animation & Sound (4/10):The animation is subpar at best. The opening, ending and osts are forgettable.There are no cool fight scenes. The choreography is bland. The healing sequence is a rehashed scene for every encounter against monsters. I’ve skipped it every single time after the first episode because it’s a waste of time.There are no interesting villains in this series to look forward to. The lore behind magic is lame and it’s limited only to healing. While the side characters get some form of development in their little stories, the MC hasn't learnt anything and is still the same pathetic kid he was from the beginning. The MC suffers from a fear of monsters, but it doesn't lead to any interesting exploration and instead is more of a running joke. There isn’t even a reason given why he’s scared of them.Overall (1/10):I didn’t enjoy watching this show. Every episode felt like torture because it’s so excruciatingly boring. Had I not been several episodes in, I would have dropped this anime in a heartbeat.One of the scenes that pissed me off was when the fairy could have gotten her star reading taken to potentially get her memories back, but decided not to because it would be ‘cheating’. So when is not cheating? It’s a convenient bullshit excuse the writer thought of to extend this terrible story because any sane person would want to have their memories rather than go on a stupid journey where you have no idea if you’ll be able to regain them.Merc Storia is too cute and childish for me, like a Disney anime with cliche short stories.

(how will they pro-STOP!!!)And I was like \'Hey accessories what cha doin in there? B-)\' (How did they get in there? Does Merc got hurt putting acc in her bottle even when tumbling down the stairs? And falling underground?)What I liked or loved about the Sounds:For me it was perfectó, even more to the 2nd last arc that was shown in the anime (or was it 3rd?).Where Bird people (were they even bird people?) have a city and have great voices and having a great voice will make you a D--- Ahem, forgot not to spoil the fun.I was in awe and impressed in how well they put singing in Anime (how about Mangas do they have like music in it? or just lyrics?)The Opening Theme was great with a melodramatic piano and of course the Ending Theme as well, Its like I can\'t get enough even though I do not understand the lyrics because of language walls(is there another term for it? I forgot) but the way the music was created was UNIQUE and Calming. It purifies my heart so badly that I want to buy it for sure.What I liked or loved about the Characters:The characters are good enough for my expectations, I really don\'t know what to say about them...Yuu is good enough to be the main character, he has the quality- and the pure innocence soul to be good to others, he is potrayed to be a kind and understanding boy and as well as Merc.Merc is a cheerful girl, and I love her VA really well, it suits her.Even not knowing of her past, she still believes she may find it someday which is very heartwarming.Toto was very cute and I want some more Toto-Merchandise!!The way the VA did it, is more than Pikachu\'s VA which is superb.My Overall Enjoyment to this is 9 or 10. (Maybe 8)P.S. In the last part, I wished they could have portrayed that.""Even if he doesn\'t have wings, even in different form- they could learn to accept each other whatever kind they may be, as well as well as the monsters who eat their cloud or rain and can still be accepted as an Angel even without wings, remove the old and bad culture""Is what I would like to have in my Opinion for the last arc in the anime.I really wanted to have more episodes where in the last part he could finally reunite with his father (even in a grave with a last parting letter) and a heroine other than Merc.And the way he heals every monster was REDUNDANT, it doesn\'t have any uniqueness which is very much unsatisfying. This was really an interesting production for ALL AGES that tells you ""There is more to life than this, get out off your shell and seek happiness"" (Sorry for my grammar or Terms used because I\'m just a newb so forgive me).Me: There were many teachings that I forgot in my journey(in reality) and found it in this anime, even if this is a fictional creation, you can still provide or produce or give it a more profound meaning in many stories like a picture book, yes this is more like a wonderful picture book other than being a Manga.What I liked or loved about the Art:The Art is Good but not great, I was actually expecting that Merc could have a human body (like a Genie in a bottle) but nope, she doesn\'t have any bottom which is very...

And falling underground?)What I liked or loved about the Sounds:For me it was perfectó, even more to the 2nd last arc that was shown in the anime (or was it 3rd?).Where Bird people (were they even bird people?) have a city and have great voices and having a great voice will make you a D--- Ahem, forgot not to spoil the fun.I was in awe and impressed in how well they put singing in Anime (how about Mangas do they have like music in it? or just lyrics?)The Opening Theme was great with a melodramatic piano and of course the Ending Theme as well, Its like I can\'t get enough even though I do not understand the lyrics because of language walls(is there another term for it? I forgot) but the way the music was created was UNIQUE and Calming. It purifies my heart so badly that I want to buy it for sure.What I liked or loved about the Characters:The characters are good enough for my expectations, I really don\'t know what to say about them...Yuu is good enough to be the main character, he has the quality- and the pure innocence soul to be good to others, he is potrayed to be a kind and understanding boy and as well as Merc.Merc is a cheerful girl, and I love her VA really well, it suits her.Even not knowing of her past, she still believes she may find it someday which is very heartwarming.Toto was very cute and I want some more Toto-Merchandise!!The way the VA did it, is more than Pikachu\'s VA which is superb.My Overall Enjoyment to this is 9 or 10. (Maybe 8)P.S. In the last part, I wished they could have portrayed that.""Even if he doesn\'t have wings, even in different form- they could learn to accept each other whatever kind they may be, as well as well as the monsters who eat their cloud or rain and can still be accepted as an Angel even without wings, remove the old and bad culture""Is what I would like to have in my Opinion for the last arc in the anime.I really wanted to have more episodes where in the last part he could finally reunite with his father (even in a grave with a last parting letter) and a heroine other than Merc.And the way he heals every monster was REDUNDANT, it doesn\'t have any uniqueness which is very much unsatisfying.', ""Merc Storia is a late adaptation of an ancient mobage, and as of right now, it’s one of the most overlooked anime of the fall season. I’m writing this review so I can convince you to give a chance to what I personally feel is the best anime of this season, and one of the best animes of 2018.Story/Characters:So here’s the premise: in this world, people and monsters are living together peacefully. However, not all monsters have been tamed. That why healers exist, whose job is to heal those monsters’ hearts. Our protagonist, Yuu – from “yuusha”, a.k.a. hero in English - is one...of them, there’s just one problem: he’s deathly afraid of them, which makes his job quite complicated. And he’s a wimp in all regards anyway. And his sidekick, Merc, is just a tiny girl in a jar whose only power is to float and has lost her memory prior her encounter with Yuu. In the first episode, after a confrontation with one of those monsters, they begin their travelling through the country in order to find a way to restore Merc’s lost memory and for Yuu to overcome his fear.All this setup, which was the first episode, however, is just an excuse. Merc Storia, despite what the title suggests, is not mainly about Merc, but about the unique places they visit through their travels. These mini arcs consist of one or two episodes, and after their problems have been resolved – or partly resolved -, Yuu and Merc moves on to their next destination. And while they’re certainly helping, they’re only there to give an incentive for these mini arc’s main characters to solve their own problems themselves. And the story doesn't shy away from heavy topics: people’s role in their society according to their gender, a father not being able to connect with his own daughter, dealing with loss, keeping up appearances and self-worth, just to name a few. And as I’ve said, each place is very unique: for example, episode 8-9’s mini arc is a musical - I’m not kidding.And don’t expect heavy action. Our hero is not a fighter after all. And sometimes even the monsters themselves play little role in these mini arcs. But if you can get through the episodic premise, you get a damn good story. I ended up in tears multiple times; episode 6-7 is one big tearjerker, you’ll see what I’m talking about.Art:Animation is certainly not this series’ strong suit to be honest, but the backgrounds are gorgeous and more than make up for it, especially later in the series. The already mentioned episode 6-7 is one of the best examples of that.Music/Sound:Let’s start with my pet peeve: the sound effects of the monsters can be annoying and it’s not helping when you’re in the middle of a headache or a migraine. Now that I have this out of the way, I have nothing but praise. The OP, the ED, the background music: it gives the series an aura you could call “comfy” for a lack of a better world. And don’t forget the aforementioned musical episodes. They really outdid themselves on this front.Tl;dr:Merc Storia is a damn good story and if you can overlook some of its flaws, which has nothing to do with its writing, you'll get one of the best anime this year.

Please don’t sleep on this one!"", 'I don\'t know how it goes for kids these days, but when I myself was a kid, my parents made me watch a lot of shows and read a lot of stories that have a lot of educational moral lessons that I can use later in life. For example, the Rabbit and the Turtle tells us that those who think they\'re above all others will be humbled, as well as never giving up despite the overwhelming odds. You get my point. So when an anime combines, well first of all, the anime style of animation that I clearly love so much, and the essence of...these stories that I consumed a lot in my childhood, the nostalgia that resulted from it is simply divine. Before I continue, I will be discussing many parts about Episodes 3 and 4, so if you haven\'t watched the series, please watch out for spoilers.Based on the mobile game of almost the same name, Merc Storia: Mukiryoku no Shounen to Bin no Naka no Shoujo, or in English, Merc Storia: The Apathetic Boy and the Girl in a Bottle, is about a boy named Yuu who has the power to ""heal"" monsters, or in other words, tame them. One day, he receives a bottle from his father. Little did he know, there is a girl in that bottle named Merc, who has lost her memory. Now to help Merc regain her memories, Yuu takes Merc on a grand adventure around many places in the world, healing many monsters and putting an end to various conflicts in the countries they visit in their journey.Sure, the plot might be quite simple, a guy meets a companion, and they go on a journey, helping people along the way. But because of this, the story is light and easy to digest, and the end results of each miniature arc are calming, wholesome, somewhat relatable, and the cherry on top would be the moral lessons I was talking about earlier. For example, the third episode takes us into a setting about a fairy kingdom under the threat of something that could destroy that same kingdom altogether. Here, we get a princess who\'s pompous, lazy, and naive, but for some reason, she wants to tackle this crisis head-on. This is a very, very obvious message that one should not bite off more than what they can chew, especially if it\'s life-threatening. But soon after, we come to know that the princess was the one actually responsible for the kingdom\'s crisis, and is trying to own up to her mistake in her own way. So that\'s another lesson, admit to your mistakes, and take responsibility.So as the princess starts her journey, she meets our traveling protagonists, as well as two fairies who are in opposing clans. Not only did I end up shipping the two of them the first scene they appeared in, but that\'s one more lesson: sometimes, you might not know that one of your greatest rivals might be one of your greatest allies, well, as long as you aren\'t deathly hostile to each other, otherwise that would be a pipe dream.  This is actually a staple in anime, and I will never get tired of this trope no matter how many times I see it. And at last, probably the deepest one for this two-episode arc, is when our motley crew is rescued by what seems to be a dark fairy that claims to be from a separate organization that does not follow the fairy queen. But despite this, he does help the group solve the issue at hand, which proves that even if their loyalty is not anchored on the same leader, they\'re still fairies in the end, and ensuring the survival of their homeland takes precedence over their differences. We humans could take a good example from these fairies for a lot of obvious reasons.Now, it\'s a good thing to note that this is simply two episodes out of twelve, and the things that we can pick up from the story telling, while painfully obvious, and some might say as cheesy, cliched, or shallow, is actually good in relaying to us, the audience, thoughts and ideas that we might be forgetting. The story is so simple that I would even argue that this anime is one of the few that\'s very suitable for a child\'s gateway anime despite being PG-13.Now for the art, in accordance to the claim I said that this anime is suitable for children, is cartoonish, starting with Merc\'s design, as well as the fluffy feel of the various monsters in the series, but it also complements the anime\'s nature as, well, a Japanese anime that I believe is a good indicator that it can be a nice introduction to someone most likely used to Western animation. Similar anime worked with me when I was kid, so I believe it can happen.Music-wise, I am going to give props to how the opening theme completely captures the light yet journey-like essence of the anime as a whole with the progression from a solo piano introduction, to violins, then going electric guitar and drums in the first 20 seconds of the opening theme. Yes, this formula is staple in anime songs, but this anime\'s OP really feels upbeat that I feel happy listening to it, even though I don\'t really grasp the lyrics that much, maybe because of my hearing, but aside from that, the band, Mili\'s performance for this song is really exquisite. By the way, Mili is also the band that played world.execute(me);, which is a super good song on its own and one of my favorite charts in the game Arcaea, but I digress.For the ending theme, however, the solemn feel of the song hits you right in the feels, as if it\'s reminding you that part of the journey is the end, but the bonds you form along the way are irreplaceable. Not to mention it\'s Minase Inori, Merc\'s voice actress, as well as one of my all-time favorite VAs and singers.Atataka na tenohira ni tsutsumare (Wrapped in warm palms)Mebuku hana kigi wa yure (The budding flowers and trees sway)Add marching drums and more strings on that refrain and it would be suitable for an angelic choir to sing it in utmost harmony, as if you\'re in heaven.And at last, character development. I want to focus on our protagonist duo, and I\'ll keep it sweet: an apathetic boy who learned to care not only for his friends but also for the people around him, and a loud boisterous girl who, despite losing her memories, has grown a little bit mature and knowing to think about the effects she might have to the people around her. Isn\'t that simply amazing?Overall, a pretty solid anime that should be watched by children and adults alike. The value it has that goes unrealized due to being obscure is a big waste. The way personal relationships between people who are family, friends, and enemies alike are portrayed in this anime make it an unexpected gem that I didn\'t even see coming when I first watched this.

Truly a Must Watch.', 'If you like a perfectly made sense story with explanation and good plot then this is not for you. There are many plot holes, the characters are your typical one dimensional character, not much progress and even if there is some progress, it happens super fast and without an explanation. Despite all of that, I think the story overall is not bad, you do not need to watch it seriously, just relax and enjoy it. Also, I love the art, animation and the soundtrack. Overall, I enjoyed the anime and find that it is so relaxing to watch, hence I gave it a good score.Story...5/10Art 8/10Sound 7/10Character 3/10Enjoyment 7/10Overall 7/10 5/10Art 8/10Sound 7/10Character 3/10Enjoyment 7/10Overall 7/10', ""To be completely frank, Merc is the best thing about this anime. If she wasn't in it, I probably wouldn't even have watched it. But as for my rating:Story: I can't say I particularly cared for it. It's a rather charming one, but one that I feel has been done to death, except this time it's more progressive as one might say. Ironically, this actually helped to improve it in my eyes, and I'm supposed to be some evil troglodyte.Art & Sound: The art is honestly very nice, and the voice acting is quite good as well. Some of this probably had to do with...the time it took to produce this show, but I feel like what pushed it ahead for me was primarily Merc. She was delightful to watch and listen to. This leads to the next part.Character: Merc gave this a 10. She's tiny, and cuter than a barrel full of puppies. Full of enthusiasm and zest for life. As anyone who knows me can attest; Anyone adding a cute minigirl without any visible legs to something is someone after my own heart.Enjoyment: However, even having best girl 2018 doesn't exactly help elevate a show to peak my interest as a lunatic who actually watched all of and Enjoyed ZeXal of all shows. So, do take this with a grain of salt. For some folks this would be more appealing, but I would much prefer to watch some more Index or Shana.Overall: Not bad, but without Merc, I think I'd drop this show like a brick, instead of just kinda being on-hold. Then again, I'm on hold for a lot of really good stuff, I really should watch more of the stuff from this delightful season.Sadly, this is no Midori Days, but it's a cute show that doesn't do any harm to watch. the time it took to produce this show, but I feel like what pushed it ahead for me was primarily Merc.

Instead, it gives you the sense of feeling that with the main character (and his companion), you\'re experiencing some that is good on its own merit.The story goes of the usual magical fantasy, where humans and monsters exist, and with magic of course. We have our main protagonist Yuu the Healer (considered rare in the world of Merc Storia), with the special ability to heal monsters, something that is inherited within the ""pretense"" family that is the context of the entire show. With that set in mind, The...Apathetic Boy Yuu goes out to adventure on his conquest to heal monsters, but not with his companion Merc, the Girl in a Bottle, trying to regain her memories as well.Story and characters are taken of the context of the game, and given the episodic context of the series, it can be shown that Yuu and Merc, the pair travelling to various towns, and with much danger that they face, they have to be wary of everyone they see. Yuu unfortunately is a very timid, shy person who is scared of monsters (for some reason, IDK if the game explains it), and Merc is something like a gift from his father, and just attempts to pair her up with him to know more about the outside world, aside from just recovering memories alone. And thankfully, when Yuu gets into trouble, each and everytime, Merc is always there to aid him to cut off any form of misunderstandings. The other characters in interaction with Yuu and Merc, regardless of character, personality or form, they provide a way for the pair to understand countless situations and problems: To heal monsters (for Yuu) and understanding what is going on (for Merc). Unforunately, like SSSS.Gridman, the monsters-of-the-week are a weekly recurrence, and that area is where boredom can set in very quickly and make this a forgettable series.I really don\'t know much about Encouragement Films, other than their ONA series and the great series that is Hitorijime My Hero. And I\'ve gotta say, I really am (forced to be) ENCOURAGED to watch this series from start to end. This series was just an eyeopener to their work, with the lush art and beautiful pastel-like backgrounds. Same goes to the music itself. Mili\'s OP (which was quite a shocker for me) and Merc\'s own ED, both are really calm, soothing and although didn\'t feel like a mixed-well appropriate OST, it is what it is.If this had an at least good premise, I would be stoked to watch this. The divide here would be whether at least this had good character context or either an engaging story (which it most likely didn\'t).

I mean the opening is so bright to me.I enjoy of bright Animes like this and I can\'t say that I\'m waiting for a season 2 announcement just to see more of Yuu and Merc\'s journey to the world, even though this is an underrated Anime, I would definitely recommend travelling animes like this. actions.for the Music, how can I say that the opening and the ending are so good too?

The story basically begins in an idyllic cabin near a village. The protagonist, a boy, comes from a lineage of ""healers"", people who help tame the monsters of a world. His father, an oft-journeying healer decides to visit him one day and gives the lad a bottle with a miniature watery girl. As the story proceeds, we find out the boy is actually afraid of monsters unlike his father, who is always gone, much to the dismay of his mother...and himself. Eventually, he decides to go on a journey to uncover the mystery of his friend, the girl in the bottle. During his journey, he tames monsters and gradually overcomes his fear, becoming more empathetic in the process.Now, while this may sound generic, its execution has more charm, much like a wholesome JRPG. The villages he visits on his way all have a story-book charm and great visual appeal. He explores a cheerful fairy village, a bird kingdom where its avian looking inhabitants enjoy singing, and much more. In each village, there is a problem that arises due to a monster that has gone out of hand, which the boy ultimately tames with his healing powers. The anime has about 6 story arcs in separate novel villages, and each one contained nice artwork, an interesting quest, and allegorical message.What makes the anime great is how the background art has so much detail and charm, giving off the same feeling of being lost in Zelda-esque world. Each village looks distinct from each other and truly gives off a wholesome JRPG feeling. Moreover, the various inhabitants of each village have unique designs that makes the world feel alive, as if one is really on a Zelda-esque journey. Likewise, the problems that arise within each village are interesting and resolve in unique ways. The monster designs also have a lot of appeal, which reminded me of Breath of the Fire 4\'s dragons in some respect. They have a pleasant style to them.Overall, I feel as if people should approach this anime as if they want to relax with Zelda or a cozy JRPG. Approaching this anime for a complex story will lead to disappointment. Instead, it is best to keep in mind the stories are minimalist much like Zelda Breath of the Wild\'s quests in Rito, Goron, Gerudo, Kakariko, and etc. villages. They all have their charm and sense of idyllic ambiance, which is really this anime\'s high-point.Besides Merc Storia, I have yet to come across an anime that has captured that wondrous adventurous feeling found in Zelda. and himself.

Each village looks distinct from each other and truly gives off a wholesome JRPG feeling. Moreover, the various inhabitants of each village have unique designs that makes the world feel alive, as if one is really on a Zelda-esque journey. Likewise, the problems that arise within each village are interesting and resolve in unique ways. The monster designs also have a lot of appeal, which reminded me of Breath of the Fire 4\'s dragons in some respect. They have a pleasant style to them.Overall, I feel as if people should approach this anime as if they want to relax with Zelda or a cozy JRPG. Approaching this anime for a complex story will lead to disappointment. Instead, it is best to keep in mind the stories are minimalist much like Zelda Breath of the Wild\'s quests in Rito, Goron, Gerudo, Kakariko, and etc. villages. They all have their charm and sense of idyllic ambiance, which is really this anime\'s high-point.Besides Merc Storia, I have yet to come across an anime that has captured that wondrous adventurous feeling found in Zelda.', ""Merc Storia is one of those anime that at first sight doesn't seem to be anything special. It starts with a typical journey premise, then has a bunch of episodic adventures that involve the two leads helping people along the way and not really finding what they're looking for. There are a lot of series with this premise that unfortunately never really go anywhere. Merc Storia, on the other hand, knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything that it isn't: Just a sweet, fun romp that offers you respite in a difficult world. Let's jump in, shall we?The story centers on Yuu,...a young boy who lives with his parents in a village where people and monsters live side by side. Yuu is a healer, which in this case means he has the power to heal monster's angry hearts and calm them down. One day, his father brings him a present from one of his long journeys, a jar filled with water. At first, Yuu is angry with this...until the jar comes to life and a mysterious fairy named Merc appears, apparently the spirit of the jar. Over the years, Yuu and Merc become best friends, though they're as different as night and day. But Merc has no memories of her time before she met Yuu, so they decide to go on a journey to see if they can find Merc's lost memories. With the help of a traveling merchant, they travel all over the place, from fairy kingdoms to heavenly metropolises ruled by winged people.In terms of production values, the character designs are very stylish, although some older characters look a little too cutesy looking for their own good, and the animation is fairly consistent. I will say though, the water effects on Merc's hair and the visuals for when Yuu is purifying the monsters are all just beautiful, perfectly matching the show's aesthetic. The music isn't much to write home about, but the soundtrack serves its purpose well. But the opening and ending themes are outright spectacular, both of them being soft, sweet songs that not only perfectly fit the show and its tone, but are just really relaxing. Merc's opening theme in particular is especially nice in that it shows you what you're in for and is unlike any other anime opening theme for a show based on a fantasy world. Oh, and did I mention that Merc's design is absolutely adorable? Look at her! Watery hair, sparkly eyes, and her house is a literal jar? Come on!The characters themselves...are kind of a mixed bag. Yuu in particular just isn't a very interesting lead character. I mean, he's not bad or anything, but he's kinda vanilla. His motivations are very basic, he doesn't change much other than having used to be afraid of monsters and no longer being so by the series' end, and he's not very three-dimensional either. Merc is a little more interesting in that she's much more proactive and is the one pushing him to do things in the first place, but I can imagine some viewers finding her annoying because of this, and her high pitched voice as well. I liked her okay, though. The side characters actually have more interesting personalities and backstories, from an angel boy who's hated by his whole race because he was inexplicably born without wings, or a young bird man who's trying to appease a dark being in order to save his beloved's singing voice. We meet all sorts of colorful characters on Yuu's journey, since the show is very episodic in nature and the characters never stay in one place for very long.I really want to praise this show up the wazoo, as it has a lot that I like about it, and I wish it was better than it actually is. But a lot of problems tend to hold it back. Some episodes feel a little overstuffed, resulting in some rushed writing and pacing. One episode in particular about a girl who's ostracized by her family because she was supposedly born under an evil star wants to find a magical beast, and there's a subplot about the characters trying to save the kingdom from a stampede of monsters. That one in particular suffered a lot because, 1. It tries to cram too many storylines at once, 2. The focus characters were poorly written and developed, never really getting a chance to grow because of those many plotlines, 3. The girl's tutor is really annoying and unnecessarily mean to the girl, and he admits he only puts up with her so he can be promoted, and 4. Literally nothing about the main plot of that episode has been resolved in any way. And keep in mind, this is all in ONE whole episode. Merc Storia's arcs mostly take up two or three episodes, so its usually well paced in this manner, but that episode in particular could have benefitted from an extra one or two. The storyline of the series itself is basic, and the anime mostly has the characters going on adventures and helping people. If you like this sort of thing, this can definitely appeal to you, but for those looking for something less episodic, look elsewhere, as this kind of thing will get on your nerves. The end of the show is rather open ended, and the main story never gets much resolution.But despite this drawbacks, I still like this show. It's not like any other fantasy-based anime out there, where the main character fights and kills monsters and instead heals them. How often do you find fantasy anime where the main character doesn't fight? This would be the perfect anime to show to kids if I wanted to introduce them to anime for the first time. It's got a relaxing aesthetic, beautiful animation, great opening and ending songs, and the characters, as undeveloped as they are, are still pretty nice to watch. Sometimes we just need to kick back and relax, and Merc Storia is that kind of anime. It doesn't try to be grand or ambitious. It just comes and goes, like you're on a stroll, and sometimes, we need anime like that. Merc Storia isn't perfect by any means, and some parts of it could have been done way better, but it's a nice, comfy, relaxing anime that'll heal your tired heart if you're willing to go along for the ride. a young boy who lives with his parents in a village where people and monsters live side by side.

It\'s the episodic kind aimed toward kids under 10 years old. And you will see that it really is episodic. There\'s hardly any help from the experiences protagonists gained from previous episodes. Rather, it seems the protagonists aren\'t even needed for the story line to happen. They didn\'t do much each episode and most of the story line just move on, without much need for them. You often see people saying the protagonists need to be put in certain background/story line to shine, but yeah, that ain\'t happening with...this series.Character: 5/10Character developments happen so suddenly, not everything is explained to satisfactory, 1-dimensional characters trying hard to look like they are more than just that and etc. They kind of like giving characters weird verbal tics too. From the girl in bottle with a ""nanodesu/nanodesuyo"", the merchant ""jamo"" and stuff. Really, it\'s rather silly.Art: 6/10Not too bad, but as I said with story, it seems like it\'s made for kids under 10. The color is bright and straight up colorful. Always lighthearted even when it gets dark. Quite the feat if I get to say anything. But for those who have seen stuff like Violet Evergarden or just Kino no Tabi, it\'s really is just a kids\' show.Sound: 7/10To be fair, the sound effect and sounding overall is rather kiddie. Like those you can find in any kids\' show out there. However, the soundtracks have wonderful and at times, powerful melodies. It\'s funny how something like a kids\' show can be so powerful when it comes to soundtracks.If you are going to pay attention to the details, Merc Storia is rather low in production qualities, that\'s a fact you can\'t deny, even if you like it so very much.However, once you get through that, you will find the kind of heartfelt stories you truly have to go on journeys  to actually find. Like the protagonist, Yuu grew through his journey, from a scaredy cat jumping at the sight of a monster to a young man who is able to influence people into seeking their own journey, he grew up so fast, you don\'t even know exactly when and how he grew up as a character (well, you can, but that\'s because you can watch back) - going on journeys can help you grow before you know it too. This journey might not need to be an actual journey, you just need to try something new to then one day suddenly feel like you were doing things you never thought you could do.Or your journey could just be listening to people around you. You will hear bad stuff and tiresome growls a lot. But in the end, if you listen carefully, it\'s rather heartwarming to almost every one of them.That\'s pretty much what happened in Merc Storia. The protagonist Yuu went on a journey and get to see and listen to so many heartwarming story. It\'s very much like life itself, you pay attention once, you see it dark, but if you pay attention twice, it might be the most beautiful sight you can ever imagine. It\'s lighthearted. It\'s the kind of adventure to heal you up. And it\'s the kind of story that can be easily overlooked.That\'s how something so low in production value gets a 9 on Enjoyment and overall scoring from me. this series.Character: 5/10Character developments happen so suddenly, not everything is explained to satisfactory, 1-dimensional characters trying hard to look like they are more than just that and etc. They kind of like giving characters weird verbal tics too.

Even though the narrative arcs may seem a bit redundant, the different stories all tackle complex issues and themes, such...as the ambiguity between consciousness and subconsciousness or the will to transcend physical appearances to attain tolerance, in a relatively interesting way thoughout it\'s staging and the use of iconography (the ""caged bird"" being one of the most important exemple) to emphasize these ideas.On a more technical aspect, Merc Storia unfortunately doesn\'t really shine by its animation and composition of movements. The movements of the characters in some shots often look sluggish (specifically when the characters are moving in the z-axis), sometimes heavily undermining the credibility of the scenes. Camera movements were a bit clumsy as well, though some shots use interesting techniques such as dolly shots in a curvilinear perspective background to generate depth, which are relatively rare occurrences but still relevant to notice.One of the other important flaws, one might think, is the fact the main characters, Yuu and Merc, are often relegated to the background in contrast to the other characters. While this is true, I don\'t think this lack of development of the MCs hinders the appreciation of this anime.

Persona 4 the Golden Animation: Thank you Mr. Accomplice,https://myanimelist.net/anime/26359/Persona_4_the_Golden_Animation__Thank_you_Mr_Accomplice,"[""The Accomplice Ending is something that caught my attention ever since I first heard of it.For those unaware, this was an original ending added for the first time in Persona 4 the Golden which was a 2012 PS Vita port of the 2008 PS2 game. This special adapts that alternate ending which you get if you complete Tohru Adachi's social link.Admittedly, this ending isn't as dramatic as what I thought it was gonna be. What I had in mind was that during the boss fight with Adachi, Yu would betray and turn against his party members mid-battle to join Adachi and take out his friends...one by one LOL. But what we got was more grounded than that and is actually fairly interesting in its own right.This special is just 16 minutes long as you might've noticed and I would've preferred it if it were longer. But any longer than this and I'm sure A-1 Studio would start cutting corners with their animation work again and what we might've ended up with was another disastrous episode. Thankfully the artstyle is pretty consistent as you should expect from an adaptation of such a highly acclaimed video game.There was nothing wrong with the cinematography of the original scene in the video game so you could watch that for a slightly better (and longer) experience. But there's nothing particularly wrong with this adaptation either. If you played the game then you don't need to watch this since it's not very different from the source material like P4GA was.Still at 16 minutes this is an OK watch if you've played the game a long time ago and need a quick refresher or just looking for a timekiller after finishing watching P4GA.6/10. one by one LOL.

I certainly wouldn’t STOPsomeone from giving it a shot if they were interested, but I’d neverrecommend it to this group.[I still wouldn't recommend this to people unfamiliar with the game, as I think there are better anime. But the story is actually pretty OK, and the sci-fi fantasy setting is fairly unique, and may be enjoyable to people who like said genres. It's certainly easier to be objective for the latter half off the anime which contains material I did not play in game already.]For those who have played the game: [Watch it.

It is, so far, a good, approximate recap ofthe PSO2 Episode 1 main story. As a bonus, some side stories are inthere as well (including best side story, with best girl & best song).The environments match those in-game nicely, and the fact that thecharacters look the same as the in-game NPCs is a huge plus in my book.The darkers also closely resemble those found in-game, which isimportant since they are the darkers. Darkers are important.Even not as a recap, this anime still has value for those who like thePSO2 setting. It is expanding upon the PSO2 story in positive ways. Iactually fell quite a ways behind watching this, and probably stillwon’t watch it weekly, but what I’ve seen as of now makes me happy tohave it to watch, not just because I want to know the PSO2 story, butbecause it’s a good anime from my fanboy’s viewpoint. At the very least,one episode will hit you right in the feels. And if it can do that, it’sworth watching. should absolutely give it a try.[Even people unfamiliar with the game could enjoy this anime. It gets a lot better/was better than I gave it credit for.]For those who have never played the game that may be reading this:I really don’t know what to say.  I’ve played a lot of the game. I’veplayed the first third of the three-arc story, so I can roughly comparethe anime and game. And that being said, my viewpoint is hopelesslybiased. [lol yeah it was] I’d like to say I don’t watch anime this bad, but it’s hard tobe objective about this one. [lol yeah it was] It’s certainly not terrible, though theproduction quality is a bit wonky at times. I certainly wouldn’t STOPsomeone from giving it a shot if they were interested, but I’d neverrecommend it to this group.[I still wouldn't recommend this to people unfamiliar with the game, as I think there are better anime. But the story is actually pretty OK, and the sci-fi fantasy setting is fairly unique, and may be enjoyable to people who like said genres. It's certainly easier to be objective for the latter half off the anime which contains material I did not play in game already.]For those who have played the game: [Watch it. Even if you play only NGS.]You should give this show a try. You will find value here whether youdid not bother with the story due to length (but still wish to roughlyknow what happened), or if you cared about the story enough to playthrough the entire thing. It is, so far, a good, approximate recap ofthe PSO2 Episode 1 main story.

At first, I liked it, there really was something capturing, some possible plot that was intriguing - and that something got lost somewhere along the way. Maybe it was silly of me to expect something from a game I have never heared about, but whatever, lets me go a bit into detailes.First things first, the sound - while in action itself it is ""not great not terrible"", I found both openings and endings heavily lacking in quality, none of them...was ""that catchy song that you want to listen to a few more times"". In fact, after hearing them once I prefered to skip, cause they were way too bland.Art. A mix of animated characters and CGI monsters that didn\'t look bad, but I can\'t call it good either. Combat was a bit of simplistic, I\'d say even ""in budget"" as most of the times characters didn\'t even move while casting whatever sci-fi magic that was.Characters - pretty bland, all of them. Those who had some notable trait were completely defined by said trait.Story - welp, and here lies the dead potential. There are a lot of questions about the world itself, as while being 25 episodes long anime doesn\'t seem to give us a whole lot of perspective, so we must accept everything as given. Even worse, all the good seeds of promising development were actually resolved by the simpliest way possible by some pretty questionable means. We got an all-knowing entity that doesn\'t know everything. We got some time travelling shenanigans for no reason. We got a power of friendship like it is some kind of kids show. Why didn\'t the first boss, who was a kind of ""inside enemy"" use clever manipulation for some greater cause but just pressed a button ""I mindcontrol everyone lol""? Why the greatest plan to defeat the biggest enemy is ""Just lets all go for it together lol""? There was so much space to make something outstanding and yet it all was hacked and butchered.While I wrote lots of negative about this anime, I will still give it a 5/10. While it failed it\'s own promissing future, I can\'t say it was bad. It just fell into blandness and mediocrity but I don\'t think there is much to hate about it. Still, watch only if you are in that kind of thing or just want something bland to fill your free time. was ""that catchy song that you want to listen to a few more times"".

Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle from what sources tells IS a retelling of the game and oh boy is it VIOLENT AND DARK.Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle tells of Ash voiced by Daisuke Ono who doesn\'t remember his past but enlist in ARKS, it\'s not until he stumbles across Matoi voiced by Satomi Sato when thing starts ramping up as they battle the Darkers and the higher beings od Dark Falz who puppeteer a greater...evil than themselves to be opened.The plot progression of Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle takes a leisurely stroll in how it\'s paced as the majority of the first half is build up for A LOT of stuff. Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle takes BOTH it\'s character development and world building in strides BUT like a typical JRPG in giving us the majority of the plot twists of the world of Phantasy Star Online or it\'s characters in the latter half. Now is this a bad thing, well no as even though not much happens in the first half, it\'s the building block of some rather well done plot twists to back it up and the revelations to the world of Phantasy Star Online becomes wider and wider you get invested in it more. So yeah, in terms of world building and character development, it was VERY well done, the ONLY flaw would be that you would\'ve need to slog for...like the first 8 ~ 10 episodes or so until things starts picking up.The world building goes hand in hand with it\'s characters and their development BUT the only huge obstacle that the world building had to overcome and slight spoilers here but, what Ash, the main character experiences is...-sigh- time travel is involved. BUT LA will say that it\'s handled in a Steins;Gate way, by that LA means Ash is affected by the ""butterfly effect""..as in he CAN\'T change the past (well as much as he can), so to this end, LA can give a pass on the entire time travel stuff, LA doesn\'t like it BUT time travel has a BIG impact and thus all the build up from the first half had and has a purpose to it all, so LA is satisfied with that in all honesty.So the biggest strength (aside from world building) comes in it\'s characters and their developments with Ash and Matoi having theirs in the final few episodes of the anime. Ash meets a VARIETY of characters who all have reasoning to be in ARKS or their purpose in life with some having links to Ash or Matoi one way or another. An early favorite character LA had was of Melfonsena viced by Kana Hanazawa and she changes ALOT in the anime, though a big shocker happens quite early with her. ANother would be Sarah voiced by Kana Ueda a minor character but becomes a MAJOR focussed character latter down the line and was another favourite character in the anime.

The derps in animation occurs mostly in the battle choreography some of the time as well as the character faces derp ALOT and persists thrghout the anime. Yes latter down the line the aniamtion gets slightly better but the derps are still there and though the 3DCGI use is mainly on the Darkers and robotic humans..it\'s uhhhhh blatant to the point LA CAN\'T ignore it as a detriment.The voice cast is HUGE so LA will more or less point out LA\'s MVP\'s for this anime otherwise LA will be here all day but it\'ll go to Satomi Sato as Matoi, Kana Ueda as Sarah, Kana Hanazawa as BOTH Melfonsena and Risa and Daisuke Ono as Ash, with probably LA\'s favourite seiyuu going to Satomi Sato.Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle IS the TRUE Phantasy Star Online 2 anime not Phantasy Star Online 2: The Animation all things withstanding, LA won\'t lie, sure both anime adaptations have vastly different settings and characters, but Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle follows the game as best of it;s ability as it can, Phantasy Star Online 2: The Animation however is a poor excuse of a slice of life highschool anime literally fanboying over the Phantasy Star Online 2 brand with no just cause of existing if Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle exists.Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle may have it\'s problems with it\'s inconsistent animation and it\'s extremely slow start but man if your a fan of Phantasy Star Online 2 then then anime will do justice to it and this will be coming from someone who ONLY played the PSP Phantasy Star Online 2 game (a bit).

Persona: Trinity Soul,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3366/Persona__Trinity_Soul,"['The Shin Megami Tensei brand has been taking away hours and hours of my life after having played my first Persona game and Digital Devil game 2 years ago. But, and what I enjoyed most, was the transition after I finished Persona 3 and started Persona 4. So, after coming back to the Persona world (encouraged by the Persona 3 Portable game latest release) I thought about watching this series that I had stored on my hard drive since about one year ago. After I finished watching it I was very dissapointed. I definitely expected a lot more from Persona –trinity soul-, an anime adaptation...of one of the best JRPGs ever made.So, welcome to Ayanagi City, a futuristic metropolis where Persona users seem to be more and more frequent. Here is where the young Kanzato brothers, Shin and Jun, are returning to reunite with their elder brother, Ryou, after the disastrous incidents that ended with their parents and their younger sister lives 10 years ago. Ryou happens to be the chief of the Ayanagi police Department. He has been on the track of a Persona criminal group known as Moribito, who he beliefs are the cause of the incidents 10 years ago. This group was apparently inactive, but when Shin and Jun arrive at Ayanagi City the group suddenly starts to take action. This and other events trigger the awakening of Shin’s persona.Most Persona fans must be familiar with the “Apathy Syndrome” and “Persona” terms so I’m not going to explain those. Also, and to clarify, I’ll be making lots of comparisons with the Persona videogames (3 and 4) just because I consider it to be pertinent. This being said, the viewer must know that this is a spin-off story from Persona 3 that holds almost no relation to it.As for the story development goes, the producers failed miserably. The incoherence and slow pace is a constant element that makes the whole story pretty much boring.  Most episodes of Persona trinity soul- don’t start “right off” when the previous one ended; this makes it a little confusing for the audience and tends to be tedious, since one will have to wait to the near end of the actual episode to be able to realize what’s really going on. Sometimes there is not any explanation of what happened previously whatsoever.At the end, the story has it good moments and some awfully and constant monotone passages. The battles are short and a disgrace to those who played the Persona videogames because of the lack of complexity featured. The plot focuses more on the characters as a whole and on their problems. Some episodes might be (to some extent) entertaining to watch, but each episode definitely doesn’t shine on its own amongst the others. The storyline is nothing near engaging or memorable.On the other hand, the animation is very well done. Somehow the quality and style makes me remember Persona 4, since the characters and locations are drawn pretty much alike. Also the high school male uniform it’s similar to the one used on Persona 4 by the main leads. This makes sense, considering that the Persona 4 game was released in Japan one month after this anime started airing on June of 2008.Ayanagi City also looks familiar. One can associate the city town district with Gekkoukan City (Persona 3) and the rural area, where the Kanzato residence is ubicated, with Inaba City (Persona 4). Ayanagi City might be, in fact, a hybrid resulted of the combination of both cities.My only concern with the animation design does come to surface when the personas are ‘summoned’.  Fans hoping to watch little Jack Frost freezing an opponent or gorgeous Angel casting a healing spell will be greatly disappointed. The persona’s design on Persona -trinity soul- seems to be taken out from a mecha genre anime and practically all of them look almost the same with some slight differences in contextures and colors. Plus, the personas don’t have an identity or name, they’re just ""personas""; this really blurs the whole perspective for the viewer who could wonder: “are these ‘personas’ THAT important to the plot?” At least visually the personas are just a nuisance and might anger more than one.If I were to point at the best attribute (and probably the only one) that Persona -trinity soul- has, I would say without a doubt: that’s gotta be the soundtrack. While the show follows the usual fast and strong Opening single and slow and tranquil Ending theme sequence that shounens usually tend to use, the tracks are far above average. Especially the second Opening single, “Word of voice” performed by FLOW, needs a special recognition for its quality. The original BGMs are very good and definitely add more sentiment when the moment requires it. There are some remixed versions of some Persona 3 BGMs that can be heard on most of the episodes. Also an old character from the same game makes his appearance half trough the series.Sanada Akihiko, probably the most popular character from Persona 3 amongst the ladies, appears from nowhere exactly when the anime reaches its second season. Surely a fanservice alternative from the producers to please the audience has to be the case, taking into consideration that Akihiko doesn’t really take any part in the “action”. Even so, he might be one of the few characters that are actually “alive” in the plot.All the main characters and the majority of the secondary characters are lifeless or, simply put, lame. There isn’t a single moment to break into laugher or a single sad moment because the characters don’t really ask for the viewer’s sympathy.  Junpei, Aegis, Yukiko, Fuuka, Yosuke… Persona gamers can find all the previous stereotype characters in this anime roster. Of course, none of the characters share the original’s charisma or seem to be developed to the videogame’s possible extend. The characters could disappear one after another and the viewer probably wouldn’t care or even notice the “change”.Persona -trinity soul- wasn’t enjoyable, of course being I a Persona gamer. I seriously don’t have the slightest idea if a non-Persona gamer would fully understand the anime scenario. But, I can say this for myself: a Persona gamer will feel angered, disappointed or just will not feel anything at all. I wouldn’t recommend it to Persona gamers, knowing that this is simply a mediocre rip-off of a great theme and I wouldn’t recommend it to non-Persona gamers, since I don’t want them to have a bad impression of the saga. There is a slight chance that the last mentioned group might enjoy it though.I’m sure the producers tried to make this anime somehow different to the usual content that the fans are used to. As they say: “different is not always bad”, the contrary could as well be applied:  “the usual is not always bad”. A shame that the staff couldn’t realize that: “when things go well, why change them?” of one of the best JRPGs ever made.So, welcome to Ayanagi City, a futuristic metropolis where Persona users seem to be more and more frequent. Here is where the young Kanzato brothers, Shin and Jun, are returning to reunite with their elder brother, Ryou, after the disastrous incidents that ended with their parents and their younger sister lives 10 years ago. Ryou happens to be the chief of the Ayanagi police Department. He has been on the track of a Persona criminal group known as Moribito, who he beliefs are the cause of the incidents 10 years ago. This group was apparently inactive, but when Shin and Jun arrive at Ayanagi City the group suddenly starts to take action. This and other events trigger the awakening of Shin’s persona.Most Persona fans must be familiar with the “Apathy Syndrome” and “Persona” terms so I’m not going to explain those. Also, and to clarify, I’ll be making lots of comparisons with the Persona videogames (3 and 4) just because I consider it to be pertinent. This being said, the viewer must know that this is a spin-off story from Persona 3 that holds almost no relation to it.As for the story development goes, the producers failed miserably. The incoherence and slow pace is a constant element that makes the whole story pretty much boring.  Most episodes of Persona trinity soul- don’t start “right off” when the previous one ended; this makes it a little confusing for the audience and tends to be tedious, since one will have to wait to the near end of the actual episode to be able to realize what’s really going on. Sometimes there is not any explanation of what happened previously whatsoever.At the end, the story has it good moments and some awfully and constant monotone passages. The battles are short and a disgrace to those who played the Persona videogames because of the lack of complexity featured. The plot focuses more on the characters as a whole and on their problems. Some episodes might be (to some extent) entertaining to watch, but each episode definitely doesn’t shine on its own amongst the others. The storyline is nothing near engaging or memorable.On the other hand, the animation is very well done. Somehow the quality and style makes me remember Persona 4, since the characters and locations are drawn pretty much alike. Also the high school male uniform it’s similar to the one used on Persona 4 by the main leads. This makes sense, considering that the Persona 4 game was released in Japan one month after this anime started airing on June of 2008.Ayanagi City also looks familiar. One can associate the city town district with Gekkoukan City (Persona 3) and the rural area, where the Kanzato residence is ubicated, with Inaba City (Persona 4). Ayanagi City might be, in fact, a hybrid resulted of the combination of both cities.My only concern with the animation design does come to surface when the personas are ‘summoned’.  Fans hoping to watch little Jack Frost freezing an opponent or gorgeous Angel casting a healing spell will be greatly disappointed.

Even though this anime is considered a sequal to Persona 3, besides having a supporting character from the game, and the occasional mention of the &quot;event 10 years ago,&quot; it doesn't entirely connect with the game, and is better considered a story of it's own.At first, the story is slow and confusing, but the explanations and speed picks up partway through the series.

The focus is more on story...here.Overall, though, it was a very great anime, with sometimes surprising plot twists and touching flashback scenes (which I usually hate).

Persona: Trinity Soul, is a spin-off to the awesome RPG. Sadly, it turns out to be a disgrace to Persona 3, and all of its fans.Trinity Soul has absolutely no relation to the game whatsoever (thankfully). Save one recurring character from the RPG, the rest of...the series is unrelated to the original game's plot. It's not a sequel, but an independent anime based on the theme of Personas stolen from the game.The only excuse I found for watching this series (as i'm sure is also the case with the other persona 3 fans) is solely because it followed the theme from my all time favourite RPG.What I did not expect was the complete butchering of Personas, their summoning, their power and the over all story in Trinity Soul.StoryThe story, if it can be called a story, takes place 10 years after the occurences in persona 3 and centers around the young 17 year old Shin. A normal highschool student who gets transferred along with his younger brother, to live with their older brother who works in the police force. Strange things seemed to be happening in the city, and as Shin becomes aware of them and gets involved, he awakens his other self, his Persona.That is all which is notable in the series, the rest is crap.There's no actual plot, just a gang of bandits experimenting with persona users. The plot, at times, becomes difficult to follow and I can honestly say that I still didn't completely comprehend the ending.ArtThe art was somehwat decent. The characters were built nicely but they look like a mixture of the old 'cute' anime faces and the new 'real' looking ones. The eyes somewhat disturbed me. Apart from that, the backgrounds and sceneries were quite impressive I admit and the city highlights were heart warming and the only pleasure I could derive from the series.SoundThe OP and ED themes were actually very good. But I never noticed the background music much (which are extremely important and if used correctly, can make the moment 10 times more enjoyable). Either because they never used anything decent (or maybe none at all) or maybe because I was desperately waiting for the series to finish quickly.CharacterThis was just...bearable. Shin always exaggerated his feelings and sometimes, didn't show them at all. The characters never expressed at the right places and behaved very abnormally. I feel that one of the side characters, Yuki, was barely necessary but the series has stressed quite much on her. Then the way a few characters are dealt with is just plain PATHETIC. A moment which was supposed to make the viewer feel sad and depressed brought a reaction of 'WTF!?'EnjoymentNeed I say more? You might be able to relax your eyes on the sceneries and on one of my favourite characters who made a return in this (why HIM of all the people?). But forget about the main theme: Personas. They are designed like personas but are almost transparent and their summoning is bull. No backstory on personas or their history. They are more like giant colourful flying robots. YES. EXACTLY like that. Utterly obliterated. And what's with the whale and the feathers?OverallFellow fans of the Persona RPGs, expect nothing from this. I highly recommend you ignore this series if you don't want to see the lovable and awesome personas turned into garbage right in front of your eyes. Continue enjoying the awesomeness of the games Persona 3 and 4 and their brilliant story lines, characters and plots. Don't indulge yourself into this nightmare like I did, thinking that it's worth watching since it's related to Atlus' Persona 3.

A big let down for Persona fans."", 'Any fans of the Persona series, Persona 3 in particular, will probably be excited to watch Persona Trinity Soul, especially since most synopses describe it as a sequel to P3. Be warned, though, that while the anime does make reference to things in Persona 3 and even features a cameo of one character, it has very little to do with its predecessor. Plus, if you can manage to figure out what\'s going on, you\'ll realize there are a few things happening that are actually inconsistent with the video game series.Story: 3/10The series goes from boring, to confusing, and ends with disappointing. Like the Persona...RPGs, there\'s a big focus on character development. Unlike the games, however instead of balancing that development with action, most episodes are 24-minutes worth of talking heads. The moments of action are minimal and usually appear at the end of an episode, leaving you with a cliff-hanger. However, the following episode doesn\'t start right where the previous one left off. So, you\'re forced to sit through another 20 minutes of talking, repeating the process all over again. The second half of the series has the same amount of talking heads, but this time the heads are saying things you don\'t even understand. The writers added too many elements to the plot and left most of them unanswered. I just wish the characters would stop speaking in metaphors for a minute and tell me what the hell is going on in plain English...or Japanese, SOMETHING. Why are they called “whale feathers”? Why are they talking about whales? What the hell is everyone doing? What\'s with the red lolita chick flying around? Also, I won’t mention any spoilers, but there are a few things surrounding the existence of personas, as well as one of the characters in this anime, that I found were inconsistent with the video games.Art: 4/10When reading other reviews, I noticed most people really enjoyed the animation. Maybe I\'m just a snob, but I found the animation to be some of the worst I\'ve seen in anime. The characters aren\'t drawn consistently; facial structure or anatomy unintentionally change from frame to frame. Shin\'s chin might look normal in a close-up but suddenly be WAY too long when the camera zoom\'s out. There were a number of scenes where a character moved their head and their eyes would suddenly be too far apart or too close together. These are the kind of anatomical errors I\'d expect from a beginner artist, not professional work. Aside from the fight scenes, there wasn\'t a lot of actual ""animation,"" either. There was a lot of panning across still images or zoom-ins and outs, making slow episodes feel even slower. The backgrounds were drawn well, though. The environments and dark atmosphere of the series were the only things I really enjoyed about the art.Sound: 7/10Listening to the background music in this series was one of the few things that kept me watching. I remember getting so excited when I was watching the first episode and suddenly heard a track from P3. From then on, I would wait for scenes to change then listen to see if I could recognize the background music. The original music in the series isn\'t too bad either. There are several catchy tunes that make the fight scenes (the few and far between) even more enjoyable to watch.Character: 5/10The. characters. are. so. flat. I wanna say they\'re like ""diet"" version of previous Persona characters. I can see similarities to characters like Junpei, Fuuka, and Yukari, but they lack the depth and empathy said characters possess. They spent so much time angsting over their past, I found myself more frustrated than sympathetic. Akihiko Sanada from P3 is introduced in the second half of the series, and while he\'s by far one of the more entertaining characters, I still found that even his personality was somewhat diluted. Maybe hanging out with Shin and company too much killed his soul. But even with this, I thought the most interesting characters were Akihiko, Itou, Narasaki, and Inui only because I\'m convinced he\'s Ken Amada in disguise. While Shin\'s friends are off angsting over the loss of their family members, Jun\'s playing Persona Whisperer, and Shin\'s having what looks like a bad acid trip, those guys were actually trying to figure out what the hell was going on. They were investigating, researching and showing general interest in the, you know, PLOT. I think it says something when the best characters don\'t even get featured in the opening.Enjoyment: 4/10Like I said earlier, the few things I enjoyed were the well-drawn backgrounds, music, the investigations Itou and Narasaki conducted, and a 28-year-old Akihiko in a suit. If there wasn\'t a song I recognized or a scene with Akihiko and/or the cops, I found myself getting easily bored. I\'d spaced out and miss what they were saying, but even if I rewound to catch the dialogue again, I\'d still be confused about what was going on.Overall: 4/10I don\'t know if I can describe Persona Trinity Soul as a sequel or a stand-alone series. It\'s too far gone from it\'s supposed predecessor to be a real sequel, but the characters make too many references to Persona 3 for it to be a stand-alone anime. This also makes it hard for me to assume who the target audience was. Persona 3 fans would probably be disappointed with the lack of action and less entertatining persona summons, and those who haven\'t played the Persona 3 would find it too confusing to get into.This series isn\'t worth watching for the plot or other characters. Fangirls can go ahead and watch it for the eye-candy; fanboys are just screwed. If you liked P3 and you liked Akihiko or you just like hot guys, watch this series to see Akihiko strut around in a suit. Watch it from episode 14 on and pretend it\'s a show about him walking around and talking. Don\'t worry about not understanding whatever else is happening in the show. Odds are, you won\'t understand what\'s going on even if you watch it from the beginning. RPGs, there\'s a big focus on character development.

A lot of that is down to the fact that it's designed as a sequel to one of the most popular and unique JRPGs in existence. But it's not nearly as bad as some people would have you believe. It doesn't hold a candle to Persona 3, but then what could? As a standalone series it's actually pretty good.The main plot takes place ten years after the events of Persona 3. The world is continuing on as normal, although all the leads seem to be suffering from the traumatic events of...ten years past. The main characters are two brothers returning to their old home where they will live with their older brother for the first time in years. Ten years ago their parents and the younger brother's twin sister were killed in some sort of accident and the two kids were sent away. Now they're back and having a typical high school life apart from the fact that they can occasionally summon Personas, even if they don't know exactly what those are. Their older brother is a detective, and should honestly be the main character of the series. He uses his persona to fight criminals trying to kill people and steal their Personas. He's fairly badass. Meanwhile the three brothers have to learn to get along as big bro is the stereotypical Japanese authority male who won't tell you why he does anything or display any emotion lest he admit to weakness.The art style is mostly gorgeous. The series starts in winter and everything is beautiful and snow-covered. It's not something you see in Anime a lot and it really works at creating a stark beauty that feels somewhat isolated. The character design isn't exactly as inspired as P3, but the characters look fine in themselves and they fit in well with the environment. The theme in this series is very much more mystery inspired compared to P3. This can be a little frustrating since the two leads aren't really investigating it. That's their brother's job. The main mystery the boys have to deal with is what their brother's up to and what a Persona is. The main mystery is glimpsed right at the beginning but it takes a while for it to come to the front of the plot. I can see why that frustrated some people. In the meantime you get to see some mostly slice-of-life themed episodes as you get to know the characters and build up the tone. You also get summoning Personas as an amusing sex metaphor. Kids are going around essentially getting off on drawing out each others' Personas. It's a funny way of adding a little real life in there.Now there are some areas where the critics are right. The design of the Personas was a major mistake. They're more mechlike for a start, which I think is a design choice that can be lived with, but most damaging of all they're now semi-transparent. Remember how I said the art style was MOSTLY gorgeous? This is the part that requires that qualification. It's hard to see what's going on during the Persona fights, and even when it is clear it's utterly uninspired. Another disappointment given the game predecessor is the music. The main theme is lovely, but it's the only one worth mentioning here. The rest of it is tedious and repetitive. None of that crazy synthesized pop that we saw in Persona 3.But does this ruin the series? No. It's still an enjoyable Anime. As long as you don't go in determined to hold the fact that it's not copying Persona 3's style or themes against it you should find it enjoyable. Just make sure you stick around because it doesn't start getting really good until the midpoint of the series. ten years past. The main characters are two brothers returning to their old home where they will live with their older brother for the first time in years. Ten years ago their parents and the younger brother's twin sister were killed in some sort of accident and the two kids were sent away. Now they're back and having a typical high school life apart from the fact that they can occasionally summon Personas, even if they don't know exactly what those are. Their older brother is a detective, and should honestly be the main character of the series. He uses his persona to fight criminals trying to kill people and steal their Personas. He's fairly badass. Meanwhile the three brothers have to learn to get along as big bro is the stereotypical Japanese authority male who won't tell you why he does anything or display any emotion lest he admit to weakness.The art style is mostly gorgeous. The series starts in winter and everything is beautiful and snow-covered. It's not something you see in Anime a lot and it really works at creating a stark beauty that feels somewhat isolated. The character design isn't exactly as inspired as P3, but the characters look fine in themselves and they fit in well with the environment. The theme in this series is very much more mystery inspired compared to P3. This can be a little frustrating since the two leads aren't really investigating it. That's their brother's job. The main mystery the boys have to deal with is what their brother's up to and what a Persona is. The main mystery is glimpsed right at the beginning but it takes a while for it to come to the front of the plot. I can see why that frustrated some people. In the meantime you get to see some mostly slice-of-life themed episodes as you get to know the characters and build up the tone. You also get summoning Personas as an amusing sex metaphor. Kids are going around essentially getting off on drawing out each others' Personas. It's a funny way of adding a little real life in there.Now there are some areas where the critics are right. The design of the Personas was a major mistake. They're more mechlike for a start, which I think is a design choice that can be lived with, but most damaging of all they're now semi-transparent. Remember how I said the art style was MOSTLY gorgeous? This is the part that requires that qualification. It's hard to see what's going on during the Persona fights, and even when it is clear it's utterly uninspired. Another disappointment given the game predecessor is the music. The main theme is lovely, but it's the only one worth mentioning here. The rest of it is tedious and repetitive. None of that crazy synthesized pop that we saw in Persona 3.But does this ruin the series? No. It's still an enjoyable Anime. As long as you don't go in determined to hold the fact that it's not copying Persona 3's style or themes against it you should find it enjoyable.

From beginning to end, it never really explains anything. It's difficult to grasp the actual plot as different things in the plot start but then stop suddenly, or never actually have an ending. The way the story was explained, as well, was confusing. While truthfully, the story is unique, the 'confusion' factor is so significant (as you can't understand anything about...the anime until you know the plot) that I can only give the story a 6.The art was wonderful. While not top notch, it's certainly beautiful. If the scenery were a bit more unique, or perhaps more detailed, I would've given the art a 9 to 10. However, the way each of the characters are drawn and especially how their facial expressions are drawn, I have to give the art an 8.The soundtrack would honestly get me a 6. While it's peaceful and relaxing, I'm afraid that the soundtrack isn't the type to stick in anybody's minds. It's good to listen to once in a while, but eventually, it'll be forgotten, thus why it gets a 6.I found out that in Persona: Trinity Soul, the characters were very well developed. Simple characters actually play significant roles later on in the story, and each of their personalities were unique and a fresh breath of air. Their pasts were also well developed, and you can really tell how their pasts led to their personalities in the present. The reason why the character section is rated 8 and not 10 is because some characters that got a lot of screen time never actually played a significant role in the end. As well, the main character is often seen as a minor character, as only in the end does he actually play a big role. The amount of screen time and who should get the most development should be seen as something to work on.Enjoyment would get a 7.

Meanwhile a large number of horrific murders have been occurring, and Shin discovers that he (and conveniently all of his friends at school) have the mysterious power to release their ""personas"" (giant translucent robots (ok, they aren\'t actuall robot but they sure look like them) that exist inside everyone and are supposedly the manifestations of people\'s hearts and souls), and he and his friends are pulled...into the horrifying fight against the Marebito organisation (who are ripping people\'s personas out to strengthen their own, either killing their victims or leaving them braindead).This series is great at building suspense and keeping you asking questions.... but plenty of those questions either don\'t get answered (for example: What is The Whale? What happens to the bodies of the people who fuse with The Whale? Why does Jun have psychic powers? Why can only some people unleash Persona if everyone has it?), or they take so long to get answered (e.g. what actually was the tragic event that happened ten years before the series starts) that they make large parts of the series really confusing to watch and make them feel like a chore to get through.Another problem is the appalling animation quality, especially in the first half. Background characters never move at all, and there are a few head movement scenes in which characters\' faces don\'t quite keep up pace with the rest of their heads, or their eyes appear to migrate around their face in weird ways. The art style is also quite unpleasant in the way that noses are drawn, and sometimes the shading on the faces makes them seem somewhat oddly shaped.The story also has enormous plot holes. For example, the body-swapping that goes on later in the series is never explained, and the organisation that our heroes end up working with claim to have the goal of covering up the existence of Persona.... which the first few episodes make very clear that just about every teenager in the city knows about... and which can be (and often are) unleashed in a ""Shadow Extraction"" simply by putting you hands on a person\'s shoulders for about 3 seconds. Heck, Shadow Extractions are even considered addictive among teenagers, and Kanaru, one of the series\' more tragic characters, ends up going through withdrawal symptoms when the protagonists keep her from continuing to perform them.This gets even more stupid when Akihiko, one of the organisation\'s members, tells Shin that their goal is to destroy all evidence of Personas ONE DAY AFTER A GIANT ROBOT FIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREAKING CITY, SEEN BY HUNDREDS, MAYBE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, plenty of whom would definitely have filmed it on their freaking phones!The giant robot fights aren\'t all that impressive either, since they always seem to occur either at night (when you can\'t see the robots properly because they are translucent), or in the snow (where the scenes are oversaturated with white, so once again, you can\'t see the translucent robots properly). Also, the series\' main villains (the psyhopathic mad scientist Kunihiro and his daughter Ayane) are somehow able to make their Persona look human, and like themselves, instead of like giant robots like everybody else...To its credit, the series develops its characters really well, and explores the hardships that the incident ten years ago caused on their families, realistically addressing the kind of issues that resulted and how it tore characters\' relationships apart. It also takes a mature stance on the topic of addiction and dealing with it, all while strengthening the character\'s relatability... heck, even most of the villains are relatable in the way that they were subtly manipulated since childhood by the series\' true main antagonist so that he could use their bodies to fuse and grow Persona. It\'s also the only series I have ever seen that actually explains why Jun (a boy) looks and sounds like a girl, instead of just having him be a pointless ""trap character"" like in countless other annoying shows.Some scenes however feel like complete crybait added for no reason. For example, towards the end of the series we learn that one of the series\' female protagonists was experimented on as a child by the main villain, and that she was given a reduced lifespan and set to die after a specific date once she had completed her inbuilt tasks as a result. This leads to a heart-wrenching scene of her dying before getting the chance to tell Shin that she was in love with him, but her death doesn\'t really affect anything that happens afterwards at all other than providing a reason for her absence. It doesn\'t even provide additional motivation to stop the main villain out of revenge or anything, it just seemed like a pointless way to be cruel to the viewer.Overall then, it\'s an average-quality series with nothing that particularly stands out about it, aside from its catchy and cool first theme song. 5/10 into the horrifying fight against the Marebito organisation (who are ripping people\'s personas out to strengthen their own, either killing their victims or leaving them braindead).This series is great at building suspense and keeping you asking questions.... but plenty of those questions either don\'t get answered (for example: What is The Whale?

In fact, unless you already own the DVDs or are willing to shill out a lot of money, there doesn\'t appear to be any currently LEGAL means of watching the show. But does the anime deserve such a brutal fate? Well, I decided to take a look and see for myself.The series follows Shin Kanzato, a young high school student returning to his childhood home of Ayanagi City alongside his younger brother Jun to live with their elder brother Ryo, the...local chief of police. Ryo, however, makes it clear that he\'d rather they live just about anywhere else, and as cold as his treatment of his brothers is, he sadly may have a point. Teenagers throughout the city are being targeted for mysterious reasons, their bodies turned inside out and the police assigned to protect them left alive but unresponsive to the world around them. Before long, Shin himself is attacked, but awakens to a strange ability that enables him to defend himself: the power to summon another being tied to his personality called a Persona. Now irrevocably involved, Shin strives to find out what\'s going on, all while trying to restore the bond the brothers once shared in their youth.Story: Trinity Soul actually has a rather compelling story, with some pretty neat twists and turns. Unfortunately, it is only executed somewhat competently. Not helping is that any version of the show I\'ve been able to find never have great translations, with typos and bizarre wordings often making it hard to understand what characters are talking about when discussing exposition, of which there is a LOT. And while the source material can also get a bit exposition heavy in just about any of the games, these translation issues make it all feel a lot clunkier in comparison.Art: The art of the series is easily one of its best aspects. The characters are physically consistent throughout the series, the designs of the Personas are absolutely incredible, the locations are all pleasant to look at, and every Persona user has a very distinct design. That being said, sometimes Personas are too transparent to get a good look at during fights, only a few characters who aren\'t Persona users have memorable designs, and some scenes it\'s all too clear to the well-trained eye that they were cutting corners with how characters move around.Sound: The music in the show itself isn\'t bad, but most of it isn\'t too memorable, either. That being said, the first opening theme, ""Breakin\' Through"" by Shuhei Kita, gets me pumped up every single time I hear it.Characters: The heroes are all pretty likable, with Shin easily being one of the most expressive Persona protagonists outside of (and possibly even including) spinoffs. Both of his brothers as well as their circle of school friends are also pretty interesting, with some really engaging backstories, motivations, and depth. Unfortunately, only a handful of the antagonists and side characters receive similar treatment.Enjoyment: For the most part, I did enjoy the series, with a handful of episodes in the second half really hitting me emotionally in a great way. Unfortunately, there were two key factors that prevented me from completely enjoying myself.First is how Trinity Soul attempts to tie in to the Persona series as a whole. Specifically, how it fails to do so with one key reveal: adults cannot naturally have Personas, nor hold onto ones they had in their youths. True, this anime came out several months before Persona 4, where an adult is later revealed to have a Persona of their own. But one need only take a quick look at the Persona 2 duology and they will immediately realize that this idea is utter nonsense. Not only will a lot of modern Persona fans find it hard to take this plot point seriously, it also serves as quite possibly the most blatant example of Atlus disregarding any Persona game prior to 3. And the fact that a few of the characters bear a startling resemblance to certain Persona 2 characters just makes the discrepancies with how Personas work even worse. Admittedly, as of this review, I have yet to actually play Persona 1 or either entry in the Persona 2 duology, but not only do I actually intend to, I actually acknowledge that those games, as well as their characters and stories, exist and are worth experiencing at least once.But for me, what was the most problematic part of the anime is the inclusion of a specific character from the Persona 3 video game, or more specifically, how said character is handled. This character is someone who, while far from perfect in their source material, was very likable and even admirable. Here, they are complicit in several government-sponsored schemes that are effectively what they and their comrades were fighting to correct (such as experimenting on innocent youths), and they are later shown to have used a child as bait in order to track down the antagonists’ hideout. True, they are rightfully punched in the face for this latter act, it is established shortly afterwards that it was the child’s idea  and that they and their coworkers only agreed to it because they felt that they were out of options. And admittedly, much further down the line, when this scenario is brought up again, the character shows far more remorse on their face. Even so, I had to pause the episode where this scenario is revealed for over an hour once it occurred, and while I was later cheering when the character got punched, it wasn’t just for what they did, but that they were supposed to be the same character that I loved in their source material, someone whose end-game self would never agree to be part of this after what happened to them and their friends, and that their supposed remorse was only stated, not shown. All of this is behavior that the character in question was very much opposed to, especially by the end of the game, but this anime is supposed to take place 10 years after the events of the game, and none of that character development nor the expected reactions of this returning character are present. And to make matters even more infuriating, I’m in the middle of another Persona spinoff that came out much later where this character is also present, and while there are legitimate arguments for them and other characters being flanderized in said game, they and their personalities are still unmistakably RECOGNIZABLE. To summarize all this, a blatant attempt at fan service ended up doing FAR more harm than good.Overall: Safe to say, Persona Trinity Soul is an extremely mixed bag. There are characters, stories, and ideas here worth checking out, experiencing, and even exploring in future Persona games. But the clunky storytelling, not giving the minor villains and side characters sufficient depth, and the failed attempts to tie into the series proper can easily make one wonder if it would have been better served without any blatant connection to the Persona series and just an entirely separate property that was openly inspired by it. All that being said, I don\'t think it would have too hard to successfully tie it in to the overall franchise without things that would wind up making the show non-canon by default.All in all, Persona Trinity Soul deserves a fair shake, much like the Persona games prior to 3, even if it is extremely different to what people have come to expect. I legitimately feel that Trinity Soul and its merits should be acknowledged, possibly even incorporated into more official products of the series (Heck, I\'d be happy just seeing more fan works of the series, even if it\'s primarily in crossover-type work with other Persona series). It does have some serious issues, though, especially with its poor attempts to tie into the mainline Persona series, and I won\'t blame any long time Persona fans for getting mad. After all, I know I did. In other words, if the opportunity presents itself, don\'t hesitate to give the series a shot and come to your own conclusions, but whatever you do, don\'t just pretend the series doesn\'t exist, regardless of its actual place in canon. local chief of police.

Not outright awful or bad, bust long and boring.Persona Trinity Soul is weird because the only reason anyone would care about it and the only reason it is even remembered is because it is a weird spin off of Persona 3 that was eventually de canonized. This show isn't awful but at the same time it isn't necessarily great or even that good at times. Here's a mostly spoiler free summation of my thoughts.Story and Characters 6 - The main plot of the...series is about the mc and his little brother moving back to live with his older brother, hence the trinity. The older brother is a cop with special powers and is investigating murders and whatnot about their town. Meanwhile the mc attends school, makes friends, and ultimately gets involved with his brother's work. The overall focus of the show is on the relationship between the three brothers, and this is a mix of occasional good and mostly bland.The older brother is a very typical cold-hearted individual who doesn't want his family involved with his work and the mc is also typical in his sense of right and curiosity. The most interesting character is the little brother, who has a bit more going on with his personality later on in the series. Aside from the main three the side characters are fairly simple with a few decent episodes dedicated to fleshing them out. Some episodes serve no purpose and are pretty much just filler which holds the show back significantly. The only real connection this show has with the Persona series aside from the titular powers is Akihiko. His presence is fairly minor though, the emphasis is placed on the cast original to the show.Overall the show itself doesn't have any necessarily bad story elements or character moments, however they aren't particularly noteworthy, and the presentation is relatively bland.Art 5 - This show is very dated to its time and the animation style isn't particularly noteworthy or impressive. The personas themselves also are foggy and don't look good in general.Sound 8 - Easily the best part of the show; Persona 3 has a good soundtrack and the show remixes many good songs from the game. Some of the arrangements are on par with or better than the vanilla mixes from the game imo. Aside from the fact they are from the game and therefore catchy, sometimes the music choice doesn't match the scene and aside from the game compositions the rest of the soundtrack isn't particularly memorable.Enjoyment 5 - Again, the only reason you would ever watch this is if you are a fan of Persona and want to see this obscure show. Even then it is very generic and also boring for most of its duration. Many episodes feel like filler and the end result is underwhelming. At least Akihiko shows up to say hi halfway in.Overall 6 - Trinity Soul will always be remembered as a piece of Persona history that no one remembers or acknowledges often because it is not that great. Rating this as a show and nothing else it would probably get a 5. The extra point comes from bias and the soundtrack. series is about the mc and his little brother moving back to live with his older brother, hence the trinity.

The sound was pretty decent and the character introductions started off really well- they were all pretty hilarious and had their own quirks- I wanted to know who they were, why they were there and why all three brothers had such different hair colours (...I don\'t...think we ever found out btw).The concept, although not super epicly original, was still great and enthralling- there was mystery and no pointless fanservice most anime seem to be keen on including nowadays. (Also, there wasn\'t one of those annoyingly weak female characters whose existence is designed purely to annoy you.)But then, one episode, I suddenly realised that I had no idea what was going on. I actually thought I\'d skipped an episode, but no, there was just no continuity/ explanation as to the sudden and seemingly random timeskip. But I persevered until, having just finished the last episode, I turned to my brother with a genuine sense of: ""dafuqdidIjustsee?""The \'final battle\', no matter how epic and emotional, made no sense to me at all. Neither the main character\'s nor the \'villain\'s\' motivations  were explained as far as I could tell, and I kept blanking because the characters would talk about people hardly even mentioned before without even a glimpse of a helpful mini-flashback to remind you who on earth they were.Even so, I did enjoy it... and if anyone watches it and can tell me what happened... I\'d thank them profusely. But hey, maybe that\'s because I haven\'t played the games? I\'m planning on watching Persona 4 the animation next, so maybe that would help.So, in conclusion: Story-4, art-10, sound-9, character-8, enjoyment-8. think we ever found out btw).The concept, although not super epicly original, was still great and enthralling- there was mystery and no pointless fanservice most anime seem to be keen on including nowadays.

Pokemon Movie 17: Hakai no Mayu to Diancie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21569/Pokemon_Movie_17__Hakai_no_Mayu_to_Diancie,"[""Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction is the first Pokemon film in a while that features some fresh ideas and creative moments. In the vein of the last few, it's also an unambitious work stuck in a rut.Near the end of the film, there's a great scene with Ash and five antagonists awaking Yveltal. The ensuing attempts to kidnap Diancie and run away from the harbinger of death are joyously written. These scenes make only a tiny portion of the film overall, but they stand out from the cookie-cutter writing we're usually treated with in these films.The good thing about this one is that...Diancie is a likeable character and her interactions with Ash & co are fun to watch. Of course, the dialogue isn't going to win any awards, but I feel it's done its part. Adequate to keep us entertained, not enough to uplift the work.Diancie's lack of a distinguishing character arc is disapointing. Her mini adventures aren't enough to keep us entertained for over two thirds of the film, either. It's for this reason that wacky sequences not fittingt the film are utilized to shake things up a bit. A good example of this is the infinite ladder at the mall.Just like Shaymin's film, this one suffers from a sudden focus shift from characters to the plot, where characters aren't developed enough for a character focused film and the plot is too weak to make itself worth it.The last fifth of the film with Yveltal petrifying the waking world is, again, a joy to watch. However, Yveltal & Xerneas don't feel like world shattering legendaries because the plot had no time to build up them or the legend around them. Unlike, say, legendary birds from the second film, these feel like pseudo-legendaries which only the local town folk are aware of as a curiosity.The film made a few big mistakes in its conceptual stage which paved the way to an unfulfilling plot and somewhat stale middle of the film, but from the execution it's obvious that they treated this one with some care, unlike the last two. Nothing groundbreaking for the most part, but at least it gives hope for further installments. It's been 16 films. After a draught, finally one I can recommend to general Pokemon fans. It's okay.

Compared to Hoopa movie, it was better though.Plot 6The plot was ultimately rather cliche/overused as far as Pokemon movies go. But in this movie, it's the characters (that includes pokemon) that make it enjoyable.Art 9As part of the movies, it has more budget for effects, so the already good XY art was amplified to be better temporarilySound 8I'm not sure I remember...much about the BGM. gotta check the movie again.Character 10the main characters chemistry and the joy of life that is Diancies SUPER CUTE VOICE (jp original voice) IS A MIRACLE OF LIFE AND OMFG SHE'S SO DAMN CUTE I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED THE DIANCIE DISTRIBUTION EVENTYeha.

Diancie and the Cocoon of Destiny, however, is different, becoming most likely my least favourite Pokemon film yet.I watched the Cartoon Network broadcast of the movie, so perhaps that\'s the reason why, but this movie felt very hurried, and it lacked impact as a result.The story was very much to the formula of numerous other Pokemon movies. Meet new Pokemon -> Help it achieve its goal -> Uh-oh! Human baddies/Pokemon baddies -> Friendship prevails!This same old...layout is usually remedied from being too boring by the individuality of the setting, Pokemon or enemies. However, Diancie\'s movie had no fully interesting setting, moving about across pretty same-y towns and areas, with only the Carbine tunnels being somewhat more unique.The bulk of the movie was comprised of a complete lack of action, with small, unsatisfying battles scattered throughout. This lack of action, however, provided the place for a few gags which were, to a degree, entertaining... But overall, the film just seemed boring and devoid of purpose.The end-game villain, Yveltal, appeared somewhat briefly towards the conclusion, and was quickly sent packing. Unlike other big-bad, such as the monster from Jirachi Wish Maker, Yveltal lacked a real sense of awe and excitement when it arrived, and was a disappointment that could have been cool.Oh, did I mention that Pikachu got turned into stone at the end? How absolutely original!The art was some of the best from a Pokemon movie. The use of CGI was nice, and the whole movie was attractive and stylish. The sound, as well, was fitting and quite good, including a rehash of the ""Gotta Catch \'em All!"" theme which surprisingly WASN\'T terrible! The voice acting, the first of the English dub I\'ve heard for XY, matched the characters and their original voices pretty well, especially Citron (or Clemont). Diancie\'s voice, however, became gradually more and more annoying, something that was only made worse by the overkill of flimsy dialogue about ""bein frienz"".The characters in the film were, in my opinion, one major reason this movie failed. The original characters could have been interesting, but even then, characters that drove the storyline were paper-thin and unmemorable. Supposedly important characters were barely introduced prior to the ending. Ninja Riot, for example, was a silly character who seemed to mock the whole idea of a ninja, and it was kinda funny... But, his seriously limited screen time held him back from being memorable beyond next week, no matter how ballin\' his Ninjask flight was. Ash and his gang of above-par pals, Serena, Bonnie and Clemont, were as good as they usually are, and Team Rocket were there, despite having no real role. But that\'s not a change, now, is it?I didn\'t enjoy this movie nearly as much as I wanted to. The film had the potential to be exciting and radical, but instead was bland and uninteresting. If you want to watch just one new Pokemon movie, I recommend you wait until next year\'s ORAS movie - because, I mean, how can they mess up a movie about the Super Ancient Pokemon? layout is usually remedied from being too boring by the individuality of the setting, Pokemon or enemies.

I feel almost like you could take out the Pokémon elements completely and still have the core story of an irresponsible princess growing up into a stronger person, and I really liked that.But on top of that, there was just a lot going on in this movie, and I think it worked here. There were four different treasure hunters/thieves on top of Team Rocket, and they actually all fit into this movie pretty well. I thought it was an especially nice touch that they each had one of the final evolved forms of the Kalos starters,...rather than a more generically evil-looking, villain Pokémon. I saw this one after I'd finished the whole series, but this looks to have been set pretty early into XY, so it would have been really cool to see then. On top of that, each of our heroes had a place in this story, which doesn't feel like it should be a lot to ask, but there have definitely been Pokémon movies in the past where Ash is off being heroic, and his companions are just trailing along after him the whole time. In this movie, it really felt like they all came together to combat some great evil or threat, the way it should be.I enjoyed the music. The visuals were really striking in this one... I just finished the Volcanion movie earlier today and was pretty disappointed, so I was just really pleasantly surprised at what this one achieved. rather than a more generically evil-looking, villain Pokémon.

Diancie can't create a new crystal that can save her home, so she goes off in search of Xerneas to help her obtain that power. It starts off on a high note, but then it starts falling flat. There's a whole chunk of the movie that feels like filler with Diancie traveling with Ash...and friends, and then the climax feels forced and not that high stakes.The characters are mixed. Diancie is a very good character, pulling off the sheltered princess character well and making her insecurities feel real. The Carbink team that accompany her are also a decent bunch, any of these characters could be humans and it'd still work well. The human characters themselves though, not so much. The villains of this movie don't have much motivation beyond capturing Diancie so she'll make diamonds. They aren't established much beyond this fact. It doesn't help that the movie tries to set two of them up as a couple, but it doesn't work since there's no build-up for it. They also don't provide much conflict beyond catching Diancie. Once the real villain shows up they pretty much fall short and are taken out swiftly. It's just a shame.Overall, I'd say this movie isn't bad, but stereotypical. Elements from previous movies show up and it just feels like a forgettable Pokemon movie. It doesn't particularly excite or disappoint, it's just there for you to watch. It's not a movie I'd personally watch again, but it wasn't bad like the movie that comes after it.

We start off with a huge fight between all the factions in the Han Kingdom, then there are 3 major ""arcs"" in this season. After the opening fight, we are introduced to LuoWang (Entangeled Web), a secretive assassin organization that aims to control the world through one of their assassins which made an appearance at the end of last season. Then there are two...arcs involving internal political struggles, one in the Han Kingdom and one mini arc happening in the Qin Kingdom.When it comes to plot, all the planning and political manuveuring can be somewhat difficult to follow, but luckily most of the schemes are explained in detail at the end of the arc, much like what is done in mystery/detective stories, so we can easily understand everything that is happening. In terms of plot progression, the plot is moving along nicely. Season 1 was mostly an introduction to the main players in the Tian Xing Jiu Ge (Qin\'s Moon prequel). While there was a buch of stuff happening there, there were no major moves or stakes until the very end of the season. In this season, we now have some major moves politically and by the end, we can see that a greater conflict is about to begin, while most of it was previously contained in the Han Kingdom (the main stage for this story so far).This season is much newer, having been released in 2020, so the models, rendering, everything is updated. They look much better than season 1 which was released starting in 2016. The animations are much smoother, the models are much cleaner, and the fights are have much better choreography and flow.The only thing of note is that this is clearly half a season, as season 1 was 60 episodes and episode 90 clearly has a next episode preview. arcs involving internal political struggles, one in the Han Kingdom and one mini arc happening in the Qin Kingdom.When it comes to plot, all the planning and political manuveuring can be somewhat difficult to follow, but luckily most of the schemes are explained in detail at the end of the arc, much like what is done in mystery/detective stories, so we can easily understand everything that is happening.

Sakugan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38192/Sakugan,"[""Sakugan, is sort of an anomaly, as in the type of show that takes off on an unique adventure in a science fiction realm. It's also unique in that the anime is based from a story contest novel that ultimately became what we see today. From the science fiction category, Sakugan is really something an underrated gem I don't see people talk about much this year.At first glance, the premise doesn't sound too special and seems like something anyone could come up with. A science fiction adventure usually depends on characters that are worth investing into and an imaginative setting. Memenpu and Gagumber are two...characters that exmplify the daughter-father relationship in fictional stories. Both of them clearly cares for each other but aren't always on the same page. For someone her age, Memenpu has big dreams and is eager to prove herself. Meanwhile, Gagumber tries to prevent his daugher from taking risks that jeopardizes her life. And to make matters more complicated, he himself often gets on the wrong side of the law. Watching their adventure no doubt brings plenty of drama.With 12 episodes, Sakugan chronicles its science fiction adventure by showcasing the skills of Memenpu. Trust me, she is a lot smart than she looks. Being able to repair complex machines and piloting a giant mech, you should know that Memenpu is what people call a child prodigy. She still has her childlike traits but displays characteristics far above her age. My impression is that there's lots of untapped potential about Memenpu. Watching Gagumber is a different story, as he seems like a womanizer and often getting into trouble. For instance, he managed to find himself being in debt to the thief Zackletu. And that's not all, he also gets into trouble with the law dealing with gangs, gambling, and other sheneingans. At some point in the story, I think viewers should just accept Gagumber for his behavior. He's not exactly a role model father.For Sakugan to succeed, it definitely need a supporting cast that appeals to an audience. I will admit that the cast can be somewhat of a hit or a miss. Yuri, for instance, is a leader of orphans with hacking skills. Similar to Gagumber, he runs into trouble with the law. But through his interactions with him, Yuri takes on a more relevant role in he show and provide invaluable skills as a hacker. Other characters such as Lynda, Rufus, among others feel less relevant because honestly, it's more of the main cast carrying the show. However, the familial relationship between Memenpu and Gagumber is a major selling point. The anime takes every chance to highlight their relationship and does its best work at capturing their chemistry.Story presence of Sakugan remains somewhat scattered with each episode. The first half of the show mainly focuses on their adventure but these episodes are standalones, almost like a monster-of-the-week format. The second half's pacing picks up more that focuses on character relationships. It also throws in a otherwordly episode full of peculiar comedy if your stomach is up for it. To be honest, Sakugan's story structure definitely needed more work as it does feel directionless at times. But, it makes it up for the overall sci-fi themes and main character relationships.Studio Satelight is known for their range of sci-fi works so having them helm the show's production makes sense on a technical level. And because it features an adventure, it's important for the anime to take advantage of its world building. On paper, the worlds and places our main characters journey across doesn't look very complex. But upon a closer look, it's shown that Sakugan is able to define the imaginary creativity of the creators. Indeed, we see corruption and dystopian-like themes spread across their journey and and the art style makes the magic happen. Character designs are also influenced by their personalities such as Memenpu's tactical mind or Zackletu's mischievousness. Nonetheless, I urge viewers to watch the show with an open mind because at the end of the day, Sakugan rides as the sci-fi adventure it wants to be. characters that exmplify the daughter-father relationship in fictional stories.

This is a large-scale project in which DeNA\'s MangaBox, Nippon Cultural Broadcasting, Sotsu Co. Ltd., and MBS (Mainichi Broadcasting System) jointly produce 3 original TV anime series made respectively by studios Satelight, J.C.Staff and Doga Kobo, written by the general public in 3 categories: Science-Fiction/Robot, Alternate World/Fantasy and Kids/Game (you can see the respective studio-genre correlation) that\'s judged by the various Project ANIMA teams, to help discover hidden talent and help propel the anime industry forward.This is the...first of 3 Project ANIMA works, and is an adaptation of Nekotarou Inui\'s Sakugan Labyrinth Marker novel which clinched the runner-up in the ""Science-Fiction/Robot"" category. Please note that this novel didn\'t win a grand prize, and in there so, the anime itself, if I was a judge on the team itself, I would have also given this work a runner-up position, because it had a very good concept but the execution is just so-so.Sakugan\'s story and plot would be best if you read the extensive synopsis done by the brillant folks of the MAL Rewrite team, but the takeaway is this: it\'s a father and daughter\'s journey through an uncharted and hostile underground labyrinth, combining a gritty science-fiction setting, utilitarian yet charming mech designs, and a deeply human tale of love, loss, and family. And that\'s the case of father-and-daughter protagonist duo Gagamber and Memenpu crossing distant land as ""Markers"" to explore the deep regions of the Labyrinth, and avoiding the Kaiju creatures which are big enough to put entire colonies on a high alert level because of their destructive capabilities. The case of the 9-year-old daughter Memempu that\'s a college graduate and a smart aleck all in one, a dream of a place that\'s unexplored fuels the desire to become a ""Marker"" to go down to the Labyrinth\'s vast places and colonies yet discovered to reach to that dream place, that despite her father Gagumber\'s constant disagreements, starts the journey of a lifetime that will chart new territory and an adventure that will change the course of humanity forever. And no doubt, when you see Sakugan and the environment that it encases, it gives a very similar vibe to both Made In Abyss (for the adventure and emotions) and Deca-Dence (for everything else from world-bulding to characters). I was stoked because I loved both Made In Abyss and even more so highly for Deca-Dence (because it\'s been only a year since it ended), and Sakugan got the concept right from the get-go.The characters, as much as the original novel is trying to be ambitious, is the only sin of the entire series of just trying to give some appeal to us the audience to enjoy, but coming up a bit short. Starting off with the father-daugher duo, I have no qualms with trying to make the 9-year-old Memempu sound like she\'s earned a PhD in every single thing that their underground home colony of Pinyin has to offer. But I\'d at least like to expect that Memempu would at the very least present a humble heart like Deca-Dence\'s Natsume, that despite all the bickering back and forth, she would be able to suck up her ego and not be complacent, even if it feels like she needs to rebel against an adult when it feels right that\'s depending on the situation at hand. But this kinda obnoxious character is heavily implied because of her tulminous relationship with her father Gagumber. Gagumber is no doubt being very protective of Memempu, seeing that her expanding knowledge will fill her head to more dangerous territory, much more so when it comes time to fill in the position of the ""Marker"" that unlike Deca-Dence\'s Kaburagi whom is able to discern what\'s appropriate and not, Gagumber just is hard-headed and untrusting of his own daughter if it came to the crunch and concern about life and death issues. Talk about a bickering family relationship that had the unintended effect of crossing the threshold of tolerance and being bearable, that sometimes can come off as being toxic. Also, Gagumber being known as ""Gale-Force Gagumber"" because he has a chip implanted in him with the illegal ""Gale"" function that acts as a speed boost at the cost of his nerve damage, that section I feel would\'ve best be left out because it wasn\'t really chimed in much except when there\'s trouble and action looming.The other characters are all walking plot devices and nothing more, which when I look back at Gagumber and Memempu\'s erratic family relationship, are only meant to serve to the delicacy of repairing the strained relationship between father and daughter. The closest being the new-found outcasts of Zackletu and Yuri: the former is a thief whom has a ransom on her head, saves Gagumber from his usual debt problems, and is the younger sister of his now-deceased former partner, which the former abandoned and left him to die from the Kaiju attacks, hindering his behaviour and regressing into a reckless attitude that caused him to retire being a ""Marker"". The latter is a hacker with his group of orphans being shunned from the eyes of his own colony, whom Gagumber managed to sever their relations due to the amount of corruption that\'s rampant. The most obtuse character of them all belongs to Merooro: an agent of the Bureau of Regulation to maintain law and order, and someone whom is the equivalent of a preservationist to protect the ""nature"" of the underground Labyrinth. The best example of a plot device character would fall to Lynda, Memempu\'s friend and ""partner"" whom\'s a fellow Marker as well as an acting older sister, only to be killed in action for Memempu to prove her case why she should be a Marker. All in all, I believe that the character department could\'ve been done better, instead of just using characters as just mere ""anime feelings"" to rouse some drama just for the sake of padding the source material, which referencing this back in the eyes of the general public work (as is with Nekotarou Inui), still has aways to go to properly understand how to write some good character development and establish the relative good relationship overall.In other cases, Satelight\'s visuals are rather fine for what it is, being one of the few studios capable of producing lots of sci-fi fantasy mecha shows, something that is which of the studio\'s bread-and-butter business. The only thing worth of note is some of the more notable staff team behind Sakugan: director Junichi Wada (which directed the incredible Spring 2017 show SukaSuka), mecha designer Stanislas Brunet, Kaiju designer Shoji Kawamori, producer Takayuki Funahashi. Going off by the excellent interview done with ANN with these people, it\'s clear that the staff team were very ambitious with this project, and tries to do something different with what we\'ve come to expect of the usual studio production. And truth be told, Sakugan displays that exact difference with some creative flare, and throughout its production phases, it was a constant work-in-progress so I\'d fathom that Junichi Wada and his Project ANIMA team were trying out different methodologies to shape the series as a whole, and I\'d think that it worked out good.Music-wise, I have no complaints at all, but only if it felt like it sounded a bit too harsh sometimes with trying to juggle the always erratic changing atmosphere in the show. This is Kanon Amane (NOT the JAV actress, same name but different person)\'s MC debut as the 9-year-old Memempu, and indeed it felt like the sound director Eriko Kimura just gave her the one sole mission: to act as a 2-in-1 child-cum-prodigy. Acting as a prodigy is easy for the highly intellectual girl, but when it comes to displaying her childlike affections, that in itself presents a challenge to portray those feelings when all is stripped away, and I think that for a first effort, the Aoi Yuuki and Rie Takahashi-admiring Kanon Amane did a pretty good and convicing job at playing as Memempu\'s character. The OST really though was kinda impressive as well, with the action scenes giving the Yuki Kajiura feel. Masaaki Endou of JAM Project fame helms the high-octane OP, and I didn\'t even realize that he was the face of the band until his voice just shoots the roof. MindaRyn though, really has made a name for herself from Kami-tachi Otoko and TenSura, and this is her 3rd theme song performance which is really the best out of the trio so far. Some pretty good work here, and probably the highlight of the show itself.If this was the adaptation of a manga like Made In Abyss, it would not have worked out at all. Same ""what if"" situation if this was an original like Deca-Dence that requires you to not have expectations, then it would\'ve missed the mark too. Either way, Sakugan really has a lot to offer, but just at the behest of it being the work of the general public, that draws the line of profession between established authors and ordinary citizens whom had ideas but just didn\'t know how to pull them off. Worth a watch just for the beginning, but it made sure to drag on until it loses sight of its original goal, then pull off the rollercoaster plot twist.

A decent show all things considered.', 'The show started off strong with an interesting premise and fell completely flat once I realized the writers don’t know what the meaning of character development is. Memempu starts tolerable, quickly turns to unbearable and stays firmly planted in that region throughout the show. Gagumber is barely any better and his dynamic with Memempu is horrendously annoying. It gets no better throughout the season. I only gave it a five because other than hating how the two of them interact the show still had some promise and hopefully season 2 shows us some massive changes to the characters. The other side characters are aight, but...nobody is fantastic. nobody is fantastic.', ""Sakugan feels like you could watch the first and last episode and not miss a thing because the middle was so meaningless and terrible. It showed promise as being a great emotional journey through mysterious underworlds towards a strange land, and the fun and comedic dynamic of a father daughter duo. Instead, it's silly and bland adventures and a story with not just so many things left unexplained, but meaningless villains that make strange decision that take away any kind of stakes or risks.After a strong first episode it felt like the staff gave up and the series would consistently decline after that. The world...building was there, you could say, but it wasn't explored or shown as good as in the first episode as the cast didn't do much wherever they went besides blowing things up and constantly running away from authorities. A shame because I enjoyed the jazzy soundtrack glossing over the rough looking cities, but the effort to show the world of Sakugan was just suddenly dropped early on.The animation was average, and the CGI ugly. Big Tony and the rest move in silly ways, and the kaiju's looked ugly and worse. The Lego looking CGI fights didn't help. Nearly the entire cast, the little there is, weren't enjoyable or memorable. Merooro is one of the few likeable ones, but gets reduced to a character who's appearance indicates there will be some plot this time. Constantly, the series decides to add seconds worth a plot at the end of some episodes.Once this made it clear it was going to be episodic, I knew it wasn't going to end well because episodic anime is mostly hit or miss with their episodes. Even Legends like Dirty Pair have this issue, but it doesn't stray from the fact Kei and Yuri are some of the best and well written characters in anime, and can even carry bad episodes with their hilarious actions. Sakugan took this role, but Gagumber and Memenpu were never near this type of level of greatness.A lot of what happens just doesn't make sense. One of the cast suddenly tries to kill another, fails, and everyone moves on like nothing happened. Someone might die and they build it up to be emotional, but it turns out everything's fine which takes the emotional meaning out of it. By the end of it, I just didn't find anything emotionally meaningful anymore.This is a series that desperately needs a season 2 because it failed to explain or conclude anything. That's not to say I'd like for one after the bad performance of the first season. There's nothing really known about the big bad guys and nothing is revealed about what they are trying to do besides acting like mindless terrorists and obsessing over special kids. Oddly enough, when they do try explaining things, it adds more mystery rather than clearing anything up. I really would not have minded if the episodes were at least done well since the plot mostly went out the window.

He\'s a genuine dude...trying his best, he\'s seen the world and bases his decisions on experience. He\'s witty, charming, and enjoyable to see on screen. It\'s a shame that the focus is his daughter instead.Memenpu is a child genius... who acts like a moron. Oh, she foresaw this situation happening and did adjustments to a big mech beforehand? Pretty cool. Oh, she was incapable of putting 2 and 2 together to realize the outcomes of her actions? Real smart. She\'s supposed to be a child, so I guess this is excusable, but she doesn\'t give off the aura of a child, just a small adult who is horrible at understanding cause and effect. She\'s also just a huge dick to her dad for literally no reason. The most charming part of her character is when she has to repeat multiple times how smart she is to the audience. Do mal reviews do /s? I don\'t know, this is my first one.There are 2 side characters later on that join the gang, being Zackletu and Yuri. Zackletu is interesting until a twist happens, the twist being she just throws a tantrum for no real reason. She doesn\'t do much before the twist, and not a whole lot after, which leads me to wonder why there even had to be one. Yuri is... there? His small goals are accomplished in the episode he\'s introduced from what I remember, and he wants to continue them on a larger scale. So he joins the main crew and completely forgets his goals, as you do. However, he did have 1 honestly hilarious scene in the last episode, and I can forgive him for that.The main crew is between good and evil, having experiences with both sides. Let\'s talk about the good side first. We meet what is effectively the CIA of this world, and by the CIA, I mean one singular guy. He dumps some exposition on the characters in a board meeting, where I shit you not, Gagumber asks ""why are you telling us this"" and his reply is ""because I want you to know what is going on in the world"". Expert storytelling if I\'ve ever seen it. Despite appearing very powerful, this CIA has no foreplanning at all. They just react to the villains.The villains of this world make no sense. They are extremely disorganized, and not in a comedic way, more of a ""how did you not fall apart within 2 months of forming"". They have clearly defined goals... except those goals have literally no purpose. They won\'t achieve anything and the only motivation seems to be that they want to do x because x is unnatural and the world needs to be cleared of it. That gets thrown out the window however when the main villain shows ""mercy"". What happened to ""they must not exist in this world""? Mind you, the main villains only showed up in the last couple of episodes, so I was left thinking whether the main baddy even cared about the goal. Did he show said mercy to all of his other targets? We don\'t know, because the anime never mentioned it.Despite having 12 episodes, the meat and potatoes were on the first and last couple of episodes. Whatever I watched in between was a pointless slog of one-offs that led nowhere. The ending is also a cliff-hanger, implying a season 2. Do I want to watch another 12 episodes of a slice-of-life pretending to be action/adventure with 3 annoying characters and 1 good one? Not particularly. Maybe it was my fault for coming in with expectations of Made In Abyss, but the amount of squandered potential here is excruciating. I was basically writing my own story with this world in my head as just about nothing was happening on screen for half the run time.Oh uh music and visuals are aight. I can\'t really complain much about it.

The dynamic the main characters have is that Memempu is an impulsive and reckless child genius while her father Gagumber is an experienced miner who's a force to be reckoned with when serious but is a total goofball otherwise.The problem is that the anime refuses to let Memempu's character flaws be character flaws. She constantly puts herself and others into danger due to her recklessness but it's always Gagumber who gets blamed. Even though there are some points that seemed purpose made for her to grow as a character...they're forgotten immediately in the next episode and she's back to her usual selfish, awful self.Now a child being a brat isn't the problem here. It's that the writer seems to think she's perfect the way she is. It's like reality itself changes just so Memempu can be in the right. She never learns anything, she never grows as a character and she never EVER admits fault.As for Gagumber, he's the punchingbag of the whole story. If something bad is happening onscreen, it's almost always happening to Gagumber even when he's done nothing wrong to earn it. Now, personally I've never really enjoyed comedy where one character is always the butt of the joke; but this goes beyond that. He's consistently punished and mocked for doing the right thing. It's like the writer forgot to make him anything but comic relief even though the plot keeps trying to say there's more to him than being a goofball. And Memempu seems to forget that he's on this journey with her PURELY to protect her too. It's like she thinks she deserves everything and the writer is happy to oblige.There's also the fact that as of episode 8 of 12 there has been no progress made in the story. Most episodes are self contained and don't really matter on the grand scheme of things. ESPECIALLY for character development as I mentioned before. This journey could last 12 episodes or 120, I have no clue which, and that's the problem.Whatever points this anime gets, it gets from its originality, but that can't carry a series.

I try not to spoil,  At this point Memempu is like Davici code movie but with her childish attitude....Most of her action doesnt make any sense she want to rush their journey while everyone need hospital? because she got nightmare about her father? If she care about her father why dont go to hospital? Arent she gladly play along wasted her time with some gangster kids before?The gangster kids suddenly join the party out of the blue? Yes I know he got wanted, but isnt he used to live his life as outlaws bombing and stealing. So why bother with some wanted now?On episode 9 I gave up on this anime. After some emotional confront between The most questionable character in the story and Gagamber , they suddenly made up? without any reasons and Gagamber dont even say single apologize or try to clear up the misunderstanding? I like what? the whole episode you shoot at each other and suddenly  it like nothing happen? LAMEit one messy anime, It feel like author dont know what he want to do.

This is not a Made in Abyss clone, it\'s a wacky adventure show with a distinctive ""Satelight"" vibe. Gagumber, Memempu, & Co. spend most of the show traveling between colonies and clowning on one another; the kaiju are largely a non-factor. Don\'t hate it for what it isn\'t. Enjoy it for what it is.Yes, the main plot is stupid. No, you aren\'t supposed to take it seriously. Just turn your brain off and laugh. ', ""The disappointment of the season. I finally gave up halfway through episode 8.The first episode was brilliant, a rollicking mashup of Turren Langen & Made in Abyss. The end of that episode was a shock, too. I was really excited by what was to come.Sadly, what was to come was the father, and he was so stereotypical & clichéd that any attempts to give him depth or humanity seemed forced. (Time for Gabumber to reveal he loves his daughter!) Worse, the show became more and more about him – and he is the least interesting character in the show! Nothing in this show made me...give one good damn about him. Such a poorly written character, and his presence robbed the show of the chance to do the kind of exciting things MIA did.Compare this to Heike Monogatari, which manages to develop characters I care about in such a short time; I won't say that it's *because* women are leading that show, but I will say this: I'm tired of men (and I am one) pretending they have the slightest understanding of how to write female characters when all they know is good ol' boy anime. give one good damn about him.

Also, i always like a ""father/daughter"" story because i feel like we don\'t get a lot of those (the only good one i can remember being Usagi Drop). But sadly, i was highly disappointed in this anime.STORY: 3/10It had everything going for it in the 1st episode, but then it kinda fizzled out. The good part is that the show tries to focus way more on this Father/daughter relationship, than on the mecha aspect (because honestly we have more than enough of that.)....The bad part is that it doesn\'t do it well. The studio asked the question ""How do we make this father character and this daughter character, who are polar opposites, interact with each other? Well, just make them argue and bicker with each other every time they speak."". This is literally the whole show. There is one scene where the dad shows some heroism and the daughter is finally grateful for something but after it, the characters just go back to arguing with each other, like nothing happened. If you enjoy a grown ass man and a genius child screaming at each other about none-sense for 20 minutes, you might find some enjoyment in Sakugan.ART: 9/10I am surprised that the way this anime looks has gone so under the radar. The animation is about what you would expect off an good mecha anime but the it\'s the backdrops and how the settings are presented that really sell this show. You can tell so much about specific places just by looking at them. The complicated cave system, the underground rendition of Paris and Venice, The bits of life spurting out in this otherwise baron world, it is truly beautiful.SOUND: 5/10I mean, its nothing to really write home about, but it isn\'t really bad. I didn\'t like the OP although it does fit in with the themes of this show. And the EP was so amazing that a genuinely cant remember it. If you told me it didnt have one, i would believe you.CHARACTER: 2/10This is the first time ever when i watch an anime and literally every single one of the characters is completely unlikable. Even with the shows i hate the most i can usually find 1 character i kinda like. With this one, no. Lets start wit the MCs: Firstly, the daughter is annoying as all fuck. She just throws a fit every time things don\'t go her way, she doesn\'t listen to anyone, she keeps saying extremely mean things to her father but we are supposed to like her because she is ""smart and adventures"". Her father is an asshole. I THINK that he isn\'t even supposed to be likable because of how much the show berates him even when its clear that he says what he says and does what he does because he is worried about his daughter. Either way, he is a dick who acts like a man-child and is clearly not fit to be a father. The side characters range from ""so cliche it hurts"" to ""contradict themselves in 2 episodes"".Sakugan does an extremely shit job here.ENJOYMENT: 4/10If you are entertained by 2 people having a family argument every 5 minutes they spend in each others presence then you might find some enjoyment in Sakugan. The most infuriating part is that somewhere in there, behind all the plot-holes and annoying characters, there is some enjoyment to be found, but its usually taken away from you fairly quickly. Every time a character is about/in the middle of doing something cool they get interupted by, guess what?? more arguing.ENDING STATEMENT: I didn\'t have high expectations for Sakugan so i cant really say it\'s disappointing, but i can say its underwhelming. I cant see myself remembering this anime\'s existence in 2 weeks. I\'m sorry but i don\'t recommend wasting your time with Sakugan.OVERALL RATING: 5 (closer to a 4) The bad part is that it doesn\'t do it well.

Write that down!” because it sounded like a good idea at the time.Story:In the underground world of the labyrinth exists different colonies that’re interconnected by the various tunnels that allow the people of the colonies to export goods and mingle with one another. In the colony of Pinyin lives a father and daughter named Gagamber and Memempu who help excavate the mines as a means to both...make ends meet and contribute to the colony. But Memempu wants something more. After discovering a secret stone that might lead to a tower that she’s repeatedly seen in her dreams, Memempu tries to get her father to let her go on this journey to find this place somewhere in the labyrinth. When mysterious beasts named Kaijuu (because that’s real creative) attack the colony, Gagamber finally, after much whining from his daughter, finally lets her with him in tow go on the journey that she so desperately wants.Marketed as a daddy/daughter journey through the underground, Sakugan feels more like a melting pot of genre ideas that in spite of the what the showrunners probably thought, really does not go together all that well. Every episode within the show’s 12 episode runtime focuses on a completely different subplot from anything that came previous to it. What this leads to is a plot that’s incredibly disjointed, and a narrative that either just bandages everything before it as a means to move on from that situation, or just forget it altogether in favor of doing this cool new thing that’s most definitely relevant to the plot.So what do we get from this? Well, we get stories like toppling the local government, to parodies of castaway, to wanton terrorism, and the mako factory in Final Fantasy VII where we have a casual teatime because I honestly couldn’t imagine a better thing to do when you’re trying to spread the idea of environmentalism. Because of this, nothing really matters in Sakugan. Practically everything happens without much substance, and the narrative trying so hard to squeeze in little stories that have some form of relevancy ends up doing more harm than good. Complete character motivations just disappear in the blink of an eye, consequences really have no meaning at the end of the day since the characters just run from everything, and the plot to find this mysterious tower in a hidden part of the labyrinth has no narrative weight because 80% of the show completely forgets that that was the entire point of the show to begin with. It almost feels more like a starting gun to jumpstart the plot in the right way instead of anything that mattered narratively to the plot.To the show’s credit though, I will give it the fact that it has style. Sakugan at least at face value, has a lot of rampant screaming, dumb moments, and bouts of character via constant arguing that’s oddly charming to watch. Yes the bickering can get annoying, but considering it’s the one part of the show I genuinely enjoyed because it’s a bunch of idiots travelling in this underground world, I can get behind that. Of course we could’ve had that AND a half-decent story, but I guess that’s asking for too much, huh?So, while the amount of character bickering does make up for some of the show’s shortcomings, ultimately the story is largely disappointing because it both fails to provide a decent narrative and just has too much shit clogging its gears to keep everything running smoothly. If this was advertised as more of a colony hopping journey, I think it might’ve turned out better. But as it stands now, especially with the ending giving a non-answer to the entire conflict as a whole unless a second season happens, the story is laughably bad and at best a confusing mess of mini-plots that feel like putting a round peg in a square hole.Characters:I’ll get started with our titular ‘daughter’ here because god there is just so much to say about her. Memempu is a 9 year old college graduate and is regarded as a child genius. A fact that the show will routinely tell you is part of her character on account of how little everyone wants to shut up about the fact that she graduated college at a young age. Memempu is both the best and worst parts of the show, as her character borders the very fine line of being a good and competent child character while also being a terribly written character because the show always seems to want to make it seem like she’s right. I would like to believe that the initial idea that the showrunners had was to take Memempu on this journey in order to give her more of a perspective on the lives of other people in order to learn, grow, and expand her horizons in order to mature into a well-rounded person. Sakugan is not about that. Instead, the show uses Memempu to bully her shallow-minded ideals into the lives of other people, especially her father, only to prove that her way of thinking was correct all along, and Gagamber is just an old geezer who can’t understand that we have to stick it to the man, or get people to think freely. As if her privilege can be easily spread amongst everyone she encounters. It’s irritating to watch since her character consistently does this, up until the last few episodes where the show rushes her development to the point of making it feel fake and contrived. It’s not all bad though. In relation to her father’s bad habits I do find her to be the better character in that regard, but the amount of scolding and outright toxic behavior she has towards the man who’s just trying to keep her safe and learn that things aren’t always so black and white is tiring and genuinely unfun to watch simply because of how little she learns from her experiences even after being in several life or death situations and getting kidnapped like twice or thrice.Gagamber by contrast is a much better character, but is specifically thrown out of the spotlight in favor of his daughter in spite of his drastically better character traits that should’ve been utilized more. As a previous Marker, Gagamber has past experience with travelling the labyrinth and has a history of life experiences that give him a more mature and veteran mindset in contrast to his daughter’s more closed-minded thought process. He’s cautious, always thinking about her safety, and makes sure she that learns the same lessons that he did before tragedies happen. He has some bad habits like gambling and women, but for the most part he tries to be the father figure that she needs. And what does the show do? Say to his face that he’s wrong and that Memempu’s reckless behavior is the way of the future because nothing’s going to happen unless you go at it guns blazing. Which is just an awful way to write your daddy/daughter combo, especially in regards to just how much time is dedicated to making Gagamber save his daughter and clean up after her mistakes, which is like the most obvious way of showing “I told you so” to the audience. Like for fucks sakes, use that supposedly smart brain you have for once, kid.The other two members of their party, Zack and Yuri, are not very interesting characters because their character development/setup are for the most part about one episode each. Zack is a bounty hunter/criminal and Yuri is a hacker who wants to stick it to the man. They don’t offer that much to the show as a whole because of their lackluster traits, and really only come along for the ride in order to fill up the team and add in some specialties, whatever that may be. In truth, I think the show could’ve really done without them, and nothing of value would’ve been gained or lost.Similarly, the sidecast is full of a bunch of one-off characters that lose relevancy rather quickly. Meroro, who’s the show’s designated bureaucrat, is probably the only notable member of the cast because he seems to show up everywhere and makes the main cast do his environmentalist work for him. And then there’s Shibito, the antagonist terrorist organization that have motives so vague that 144p makes clearer pictures than they do. Shibito hardly shows up over the course of the series, doesn’t really do anything aside from spout some random propaganda about a ‘dead world’, and just says things that have apparently have relevance in spite of the fact that none of what they’re saying has any prior connotation whatsoever. In short, a very badly written evil team that feels like they were thrown in last minute as a way to try and give the show an ultimate antagonist without doing any of the work needed in order to make them read like a proper, genuine threat.Aesthetics:Satelight’s work with Sakugan is honestly something I really like from a setting and creativity perspective. The underground caverns while kind of generic with the whole ‘secret world underground aesthetic’ does still look good and pleasing to the eye in spite of the show’s confusing plot. There’re a surprising amount of different setpieces in this show, ranging from the mako factory I mentioned earlier, to the various nature backgrounds in the tunnels, as well as the different colonies idolizing certain ideals in order to make up the appearance of the architecture and culture of each place that the characters visit.Character design is also something I’m a fan of here, more for the daddy/daughter combo since we have Gagamber dressed in a mining work uniform with his daughter by comparison looking more like a scrappy mechanic that gets her hands dirty no matter the situation. It’s a nice little dynamic they have there with orderly vs. disorderly, and it works for their characters quite well.What isn’t so nice though is the CGI that she show uses. The mechs in particular I think can be excused on account of the actions that they take flying through the air and zipping around, but the kaijuus… Man, the kaijuus do not look good. They look cheap as hell and move way clunkier than the mechs do. Which I think is a testament to how little they cared about the kaijuus seeing as they basically didn’t show up or were even a conceivable threat for a majority of the show. Which again, why is that? Did they just forget that the kaijuus were a thing?Masaaki Endoh’s “Koukotsu Layrinth” should not slap as hard as it does. The energetic rock and style of this OP makes it one of my favorites of the shows I’ve watched this season, and for some reason hits that right tones for me for a daddy/daughter adventure. It’s a memorable piece for the me that sticks hard in my mind as something that you’d put on when driving in the car. MindaRyn’s “Shine” on the other hand hits too many generic notes for my taste, and is made worse by the fact that this song usually comes up after the show just kind of throws shit at the wall, as if we’re supposed to be happy after the absolute fuckfest of an episode finishes. By itself though, it’s ok. Not fantastic, but not bad or jarring either.Final Thoughts:When I started this show, I thought it was just going to be a fun mecha romp with a daddy/daughter combo. And the first episode kind of promised that with story potential that could’ve been at least a fun show to watch. What we got instead was a show that promised absolutely none of that and instead went on a rollercoaster adventure of ideas that were flung at a wall without any care or thought with how any of it all matched with one another. Stick it to the man? Sure, let’s do that. Beach episode? Sure, let’s do that. Gang violence? Sure, let’s do that. Wanton terrorism with a group that up until that point had a grand total of 3 minutes of screentime to show that they were any kind of conceivable threat? Sure, why not? Let’s do that.Can you tell I didn’t enjoy this one? I’m a firm believer or sticking to pretty much only one cool thing in your stories because in doing so, you get the opportunity to turn that one cool thing into an overarching narrative that can engage your audience. Trying to squeeze in a cool thing every episode only makes the whole very messy, especially if you have a starting gun of an idea that just almost never shows up or has relevancy past the first episode or two. The kaijuus, any corrupt government in past colonies, any small mysteries that the characters discover, almost none of that matters because the show decided that it had already done/shown it, so there’s no reason to go back or explore it more. Because of this, the whiplash I got from watching Sakugan made me care less and less about the show and made me want to hope that it was going to end faster. And in the end, it stumbled its way into an ending that I’m sure even the showrunners don’t know if it’s the ending or not because of the cheeky shit that they pull off there.I think if they had cut away all of the fat, focus itself back into one thing like using Shibito as the looming threat and not just arbitrarily shoehorn in stuff like the “Rainbow Children” at the very end like the revelation had any real weight, then it could’ve been a decent narrative with character, style, and motives instead of using Memempu’s desire to find the tower in her dream as an arbitrary reason to go to the next colony and fuck up things over there. Seriously. Like the millions of dollars in property damage that’s caused really doesn’t seem to matter in the long run given how often entire civilizations are destroyed in the process of Memempu and Gagamber just moseying on through town.My resulting recommendation for this show really is to just not to consider this one as a list contender. Sakugan has far too many narrative issues that I’m willing to let slide, made even worse by the fact that Memempu’s infuriating character traits make her a less than stellar protagonist that the show infuriatingly tries to make seem indomitable in her ideals and can do no wrong. Which if I have to deal with that, as well as a revolving narrative that never stays on one idea for more than 10 minutes, then it’s not worth a watch to me. make ends meet and contribute to the colony. But Memempu wants something more. After discovering a secret stone that might lead to a tower that she’s repeatedly seen in her dreams, Memempu tries to get her father to let her go on this journey to find this place somewhere in the labyrinth. When mysterious beasts named Kaijuu (because that’s real creative) attack the colony, Gagamber finally, after much whining from his daughter, finally lets her with him in tow go on the journey that she so desperately wants.Marketed as a daddy/daughter journey through the underground, Sakugan feels more like a melting pot of genre ideas that in spite of the what the showrunners probably thought, really does not go together all that well. Every episode within the show’s 12 episode runtime focuses on a completely different subplot from anything that came previous to it. What this leads to is a plot that’s incredibly disjointed, and a narrative that either just bandages everything before it as a means to move on from that situation, or just forget it altogether in favor of doing this cool new thing that’s most definitely relevant to the plot.So what do we get from this? Well, we get stories like toppling the local government, to parodies of castaway, to wanton terrorism, and the mako factory in Final Fantasy VII where we have a casual teatime because I honestly couldn’t imagine a better thing to do when you’re trying to spread the idea of environmentalism. Because of this, nothing really matters in Sakugan. Practically everything happens without much substance, and the narrative trying so hard to squeeze in little stories that have some form of relevancy ends up doing more harm than good. Complete character motivations just disappear in the blink of an eye, consequences really have no meaning at the end of the day since the characters just run from everything, and the plot to find this mysterious tower in a hidden part of the labyrinth has no narrative weight because 80% of the show completely forgets that that was the entire point of the show to begin with. It almost feels more like a starting gun to jumpstart the plot in the right way instead of anything that mattered narratively to the plot.To the show’s credit though, I will give it the fact that it has style. Sakugan at least at face value, has a lot of rampant screaming, dumb moments, and bouts of character via constant arguing that’s oddly charming to watch. Yes the bickering can get annoying, but considering it’s the one part of the show I genuinely enjoyed because it’s a bunch of idiots travelling in this underground world, I can get behind that. Of course we could’ve had that AND a half-decent story, but I guess that’s asking for too much, huh?So, while the amount of character bickering does make up for some of the show’s shortcomings, ultimately the story is largely disappointing because it both fails to provide a decent narrative and just has too much shit clogging its gears to keep everything running smoothly. If this was advertised as more of a colony hopping journey, I think it might’ve turned out better. But as it stands now, especially with the ending giving a non-answer to the entire conflict as a whole unless a second season happens, the story is laughably bad and at best a confusing mess of mini-plots that feel like putting a round peg in a square hole.Characters:I’ll get started with our titular ‘daughter’ here because god there is just so much to say about her. Memempu is a 9 year old college graduate and is regarded as a child genius. A fact that the show will routinely tell you is part of her character on account of how little everyone wants to shut up about the fact that she graduated college at a young age. Memempu is both the best and worst parts of the show, as her character borders the very fine line of being a good and competent child character while also being a terribly written character because the show always seems to want to make it seem like she’s right. I would like to believe that the initial idea that the showrunners had was to take Memempu on this journey in order to give her more of a perspective on the lives of other people in order to learn, grow, and expand her horizons in order to mature into a well-rounded person. Sakugan is not about that. Instead, the show uses Memempu to bully her shallow-minded ideals into the lives of other people, especially her father, only to prove that her way of thinking was correct all along, and Gagamber is just an old geezer who can’t understand that we have to stick it to the man, or get people to think freely. As if her privilege can be easily spread amongst everyone she encounters. It’s irritating to watch since her character consistently does this, up until the last few episodes where the show rushes her development to the point of making it feel fake and contrived. It’s not all bad though. In relation to her father’s bad habits I do find her to be the better character in that regard, but the amount of scolding and outright toxic behavior she has towards the man who’s just trying to keep her safe and learn that things aren’t always so black and white is tiring and genuinely unfun to watch simply because of how little she learns from her experiences even after being in several life or death situations and getting kidnapped like twice or thrice.Gagamber by contrast is a much better character, but is specifically thrown out of the spotlight in favor of his daughter in spite of his drastically better character traits that should’ve been utilized more. As a previous Marker, Gagamber has past experience with travelling the labyrinth and has a history of life experiences that give him a more mature and veteran mindset in contrast to his daughter’s more closed-minded thought process. He’s cautious, always thinking about her safety, and makes sure she that learns the same lessons that he did before tragedies happen. He has some bad habits like gambling and women, but for the most part he tries to be the father figure that she needs. And what does the show do? Say to his face that he’s wrong and that Memempu’s reckless behavior is the way of the future because nothing’s going to happen unless you go at it guns blazing. Which is just an awful way to write your daddy/daughter combo, especially in regards to just how much time is dedicated to making Gagamber save his daughter and clean up after her mistakes, which is like the most obvious way of showing “I told you so” to the audience. Like for fucks sakes, use that supposedly smart brain you have for once, kid.The other two members of their party, Zack and Yuri, are not very interesting characters because their character development/setup are for the most part about one episode each. Zack is a bounty hunter/criminal and Yuri is a hacker who wants to stick it to the man. They don’t offer that much to the show as a whole because of their lackluster traits, and really only come along for the ride in order to fill up the team and add in some specialties, whatever that may be. In truth, I think the show could’ve really done without them, and nothing of value would’ve been gained or lost.Similarly, the sidecast is full of a bunch of one-off characters that lose relevancy rather quickly. Meroro, who’s the show’s designated bureaucrat, is probably the only notable member of the cast because he seems to show up everywhere and makes the main cast do his environmentalist work for him. And then there’s Shibito, the antagonist terrorist organization that have motives so vague that 144p makes clearer pictures than they do. Shibito hardly shows up over the course of the series, doesn’t really do anything aside from spout some random propaganda about a ‘dead world’, and just says things that have apparently have relevance in spite of the fact that none of what they’re saying has any prior connotation whatsoever. In short, a very badly written evil team that feels like they were thrown in last minute as a way to try and give the show an ultimate antagonist without doing any of the work needed in order to make them read like a proper, genuine threat.Aesthetics:Satelight’s work with Sakugan is honestly something I really like from a setting and creativity perspective. The underground caverns while kind of generic with the whole ‘secret world underground aesthetic’ does still look good and pleasing to the eye in spite of the show’s confusing plot. There’re a surprising amount of different setpieces in this show, ranging from the mako factory I mentioned earlier, to the various nature backgrounds in the tunnels, as well as the different colonies idolizing certain ideals in order to make up the appearance of the architecture and culture of each place that the characters visit.Character design is also something I’m a fan of here, more for the daddy/daughter combo since we have Gagamber dressed in a mining work uniform with his daughter by comparison looking more like a scrappy mechanic that gets her hands dirty no matter the situation. It’s a nice little dynamic they have there with orderly vs. disorderly, and it works for their characters quite well.What isn’t so nice though is the CGI that she show uses. The mechs in particular I think can be excused on account of the actions that they take flying through the air and zipping around, but the kaijuus… Man, the kaijuus do not look good. They look cheap as hell and move way clunkier than the mechs do. Which I think is a testament to how little they cared about the kaijuus seeing as they basically didn’t show up or were even a conceivable threat for a majority of the show. Which again, why is that? Did they just forget that the kaijuus were a thing?Masaaki Endoh’s “Koukotsu Layrinth” should not slap as hard as it does. The energetic rock and style of this OP makes it one of my favorites of the shows I’ve watched this season, and for some reason hits that right tones for me for a daddy/daughter adventure. It’s a memorable piece for the me that sticks hard in my mind as something that you’d put on when driving in the car. MindaRyn’s “Shine” on the other hand hits too many generic notes for my taste, and is made worse by the fact that this song usually comes up after the show just kind of throws shit at the wall, as if we’re supposed to be happy after the absolute fuckfest of an episode finishes. By itself though, it’s ok. Not fantastic, but not bad or jarring either.Final Thoughts:When I started this show, I thought it was just going to be a fun mecha romp with a daddy/daughter combo. And the first episode kind of promised that with story potential that could’ve been at least a fun show to watch. What we got instead was a show that promised absolutely none of that and instead went on a rollercoaster adventure of ideas that were flung at a wall without any care or thought with how any of it all matched with one another. Stick it to the man? Sure, let’s do that. Beach episode? Sure, let’s do that. Gang violence? Sure, let’s do that. Wanton terrorism with a group that up until that point had a grand total of 3 minutes of screentime to show that they were any kind of conceivable threat? Sure, why not? Let’s do that.Can you tell I didn’t enjoy this one?

I was excited to see what they could do with something that was a combination of Made in Abyss and Gurren Lagann, but it's disappointing.  Characters are very anime-esque meaning that they don't feel human at all and have very typical characteristics.  Plenty of characters are introduced that don't get any development or get surface level development. The worldbuilding is not very good and it seems the main plot still hasn't been talked about even though it's already on the 6 episode. There are moments where it focuses on real character moments, but then is immediately...neutralized by the ridiculous ways conflicts are solved and dumb character motivations. neutralized by the ridiculous ways conflicts are solved and dumb character motivations."", 'If there\'s one thing I hate, it\'s ""Read the Novel!"" endings. Especially so considering this is from a competition where the winning novel would have been animated, so you\'d expect at least the production committee to fully animate the damned thing. At the time of this writing, no sequel season to Sakugan has been announced, so I am gonna dock it for not bothering to end conclusively.That said, even taken as it is, ignoring all the plot elements, Sakugan is still a blast. The show is largely an episodic romp/road trip through various locales with a dad-daughter tag team plus two extra party members...who join later on, and it is a fun time. Even the penultimate episode is set up like a regular episode of the show, and the mini adventures Gagumba and Memenpu find themselves in are always a treat.Of course, this comes at a huge cost: Pacing. The two most plot important episodes, i.e. Zackletu\'s motivation and the final episode all come out of nowhere with little to no buildup and get resolved just as quickly with no future bearing on the plot. It\'s pretty bad when the main antagonists aren\'t even revealed until very late into the show. I know this is all based on some novel, but I am reviewing this show for what it is, not what it is adapting. And on that front it fails to build up its antagonists or even have them interact meaningfully with the protagonists.Plotwise, the show is also guilty of establishing series-spanning mysteries but with zero resolution, or even a hint of resolution to any of them. The final episode throws us a bone by revealing very little about Memenpu, but again, it\'s all just ""Read the Novel"" bait with zero actual impact on the plot.If there\'s one thing I love in this, it\'s the dialogue. The dialogue flows so well in this and no character seems out of place in terms of their speech or how they talk to other characters. It may seem like faint praise, but ho believe me it is so rare to have a show where the characters talk like actual people and not character archetypes/exposition dumps. In turn, all the characters (well baring the Shibito who get zero characterization) are very likable and exude a great charm to them. In fact, you have a few episodes where there is no action at all and everything is just reliant on the characters getting into dumb or fun situations together and yet these episodes turn out to be the most memorable in the series. The action sequences themselves are fine, but ultimately it\'s the characters being in them that makes you engaged in the scenes themselves.Sakugan is hard to recommend.

I also suspected the presence of ""comedy"" in the work in particular present in the rivalry between father and daughter which is the central element of the story.But despite its promises, from episode 2 the anime was already starting to...lose its interest, the characters do every episode, things having nothing to do with the story and one wonders what is the main plot.

The story then has nothing to do with the basic plot and we do not care.

Neither I nor the anime itself have a clear vision of what it wants to be. The things I can say that are in Sakugan are mecha, adventure, familial themes, commentary on corrupt governments, kaiju, mystery, drama, SoL, and more, but the anime itself never really keeps to one main idea and you often ask yourself “why is this even an element in the show in the first place? ⅓ of the eps might as well be filler, ⅓ are...semi related to the overall plot but feel disorganized in execution and not well paced, and the last third actually being the main plot but are still wack in execution and pace and just have some questionable writing overall.The main story starts off with an incident that causes Gagumber to join his daughter Memenpu on an adventure to try and find this tower in her dreams. The first 3 eps are actually a pretty good start, and we get some good action and in general well done moments. Ep 4 and beyond though is when it gets worse. A lot of these middle eps are very mixed in quality. Some are one offs that maybe introduce a new character or element of worldbuilding, but really just exist only to do that. Yuri’s introduction ep is a whole “rebels against le bad government” arc in one ep, and has the worst pacing of any ep in the whole series. What about ep 8 where Zack tries to get revenge on Gagumber and even kidnaps and threatens to kill Memenpu where Gagumber has to just about kill himself to save her, but right at the end he’s immediately ok after an off screen surgery and they both just forgive Zack as if nothing serious happened? She also continues to travel with them for no real reason other than “plot reasons”, and really it felt like this should’ve happened sooner in the series. Yeah in general not at all good pacing. Ending wasn't even remotely satisfying imo.Ok what about the themes? Well ig it has some half-baked commentary on like controlling government vs free society, protecting the environment, blah blah, it’s rushed and not done well. Oh but what about the main theme of family and a father/daughter relationship?I’ll have to dive more into the characters for that. Characters in this show are…mostly annoying. Our main duo here feel like they never truly grow even though they have multiple chances too throughout the story. I know that’s…actually a bit realistic knowing how humans can be, but there’s a way of write that without it being annoying and also I feel like that’s not even necessarily what the show is trying to go for. So like, let's start with Memenpu here.I don’t mind kid characters in anime. In fact the more “realistic” ones that people find annoying or even hate (e.g. the kid trio in eureka seven), I don’t really mind too much. Meme here though just doesn’t work for me. I’m supposed to believe this 9 yo child prodigy that is in college and is shown to be the “smart leader” of the group most of the time, is also this incredibly immature girl that regularly makes reckless and dangerous decisions? You’d think after maybe the first or second near death experiences she’d learn to try and listen to Gagumber a bit more and try to work with him more, but nah even on ep 10 she’s still STILL being stupid reckless.Ok what about Gagumber? He’s not as bad as Meme, in fact if anything the anime has this weird tendency to absolutely dogpile on the guy. Like yeah sometimes it’s deserved, but a lot of time it crosses the line and just brings down my general enjoyment of the series. There are also times when he could afford to listen to Memenpu more or at least act like a proper dad, and he just doesn’t unless it’s extreme circumstances.My main point here is that Sakugan are trying to portray these 2 as like “yeah they don’t get along too well, but they still love each other because they’re family”, but that’s not really the vibe I get. More what I see is an incredibly unhealthy, if not outright toxic relationship between these two that’s sometimes interrupted by them seemingly being close together. So no I don’t really think Sakugan handles its familial themes well either, and at worst can maybe even teach the wrong lessons.As for the side cast, Yuri is a fairly one note anarchist teenage redditor that often does more harm than good. He’s supposed to be the comic relief, but I pretty much just found him annoying. Zack has nothing interesting to her outside of I guess being the attractive action girl, and a poorly done revenge arc that lasts one ep and goes nowhere. Merooro is…actually he’s ok. I mostly liked him, he’s funny a few times. The antags are incredibly generic terrorists that have some incredibly vague, generic goal that tbh I forgot what even was cuz it barely felt like it even mattered.So is there anything good about Sakugan? Well I can’t really complain about the animation and music. They’re not great, but are pretty consistently good. The mecha design are nice, and cgi animation for them is goodish. Backgrounds are pretty consistently nice, and I feel like I never saw the characters go off model. Kaiju are…ok cgi I guess. VA performance is good, they do the job. The overall soundtrack is good, with a really good OP and alright ED.Ultimately, I can’t dislike Sakugan too much. It’s sometimes good, mostly average or bad, but it’s ok overall. If anything it’s nice to have another mecha show along with the various others this season. There was an attempt here to make something good that just unfortunately got dragged down by what feels like very amateurish writing. I mean tbf the non writing parts are good enough at least. Sakugan is an average watch, but I will say 2 things if you’re interested in watching. Don’t expect a lot of mecha action, and your enjoyment of the father/daughter relationship may vary. semi related to the overall plot but feel disorganized in execution and not well paced, and the last third actually being the main plot but are still wack in execution and pace and just have some questionable writing overall.The main story starts off with an incident that causes Gagumber to join his daughter Memenpu on an adventure to try and find this tower in her dreams.

She also continues to travel with them for no real reason other than “plot reasons”, and really it felt like this should’ve happened sooner in the series. Yeah in general not at all good pacing. Ending wasn't even remotely satisfying imo.Ok what about the themes? Well ig it has some half-baked commentary on like controlling government vs free society, protecting the environment, blah blah, it’s rushed and not done well. Oh but what about the main theme of family and a father/daughter relationship?I’ll have to dive more into the characters for that. Characters in this show are…mostly annoying. Our main duo here feel like they never truly grow even though they have multiple chances too throughout the story. I know that’s…actually a bit realistic knowing how humans can be, but there’s a way of write that without it being annoying and also I feel like that’s not even necessarily what the show is trying to go for. So like, let's start with Memenpu here.I don’t mind kid characters in anime. In fact the more “realistic” ones that people find annoying or even hate (e.g. the kid trio in eureka seven), I don’t really mind too much. Meme here though just doesn’t work for me. I’m supposed to believe this 9 yo child prodigy that is in college and is shown to be the “smart leader” of the group most of the time, is also this incredibly immature girl that regularly makes reckless and dangerous decisions? You’d think after maybe the first or second near death experiences she’d learn to try and listen to Gagumber a bit more and try to work with him more, but nah even on ep 10 she’s still STILL being stupid reckless.Ok what about Gagumber? He’s not as bad as Meme, in fact if anything the anime has this weird tendency to absolutely dogpile on the guy. Like yeah sometimes it’s deserved, but a lot of time it crosses the line and just brings down my general enjoyment of the series. There are also times when he could afford to listen to Memenpu more or at least act like a proper dad, and he just doesn’t unless it’s extreme circumstances.My main point here is that Sakugan are trying to portray these 2 as like “yeah they don’t get along too well, but they still love each other because they’re family”, but that’s not really the vibe I get. More what I see is an incredibly unhealthy, if not outright toxic relationship between these two that’s sometimes interrupted by them seemingly being close together. So no I don’t really think Sakugan handles its familial themes well either, and at worst can maybe even teach the wrong lessons.As for the side cast, Yuri is a fairly one note anarchist teenage redditor that often does more harm than good. He’s supposed to be the comic relief, but I pretty much just found him annoying. Zack has nothing interesting to her outside of I guess being the attractive action girl, and a poorly done revenge arc that lasts one ep and goes nowhere. Merooro is…actually he’s ok. I mostly liked him, he’s funny a few times. The antags are incredibly generic terrorists that have some incredibly vague, generic goal that tbh I forgot what even was cuz it barely felt like it even mattered.So is there anything good about Sakugan? Well I can’t really complain about the animation and music. They’re not great, but are pretty consistently good. The mecha design are nice, and cgi animation for them is goodish. Backgrounds are pretty consistently nice, and I feel like I never saw the characters go off model. Kaiju are…ok cgi I guess. VA performance is good, they do the job. The overall soundtrack is good, with a really good OP and alright ED.Ultimately, I can’t dislike Sakugan too much. It’s sometimes good, mostly average or bad, but it’s ok overall. If anything it’s nice to have another mecha show along with the various others this season. There was an attempt here to make something good that just unfortunately got dragged down by what feels like very amateurish writing. I mean tbf the non writing parts are good enough at least. Sakugan is an average watch, but I will say 2 things if you’re interested in watching. Don’t expect a lot of mecha action, and your enjoyment of the father/daughter relationship may vary."", 'Recommendation: An infuriating mess of a story that goes nowhere while pissing you off every step of the way with a horrendously unlikeable cast. This is the worst show that I watched in 2021.  Contains spoilers for episode 1 and vague spoilers for the end of the series.Story: Genius 9 year old Memempu dreams of a tower and venturing out of her colony as a Marker, someone that explores their dangerous underground world in a mech, to find it. Her father Gagumber tries to dissuade her, but ultimately realizes he\'s fighting a losing battle and goes along as her partner to protect her....Whatever promise you think this idea contains, I can assure you that the show wastes it.  It goes off the rails early, with Memempu\'s friend Lynda and her dad Walsh being incinerated by a random kaiju literally falling out of the sky and landing on them at the end of the premiere in one of the most unintentionally hilarious cheap shock deaths you\'ll ever see.  It\'s clearly meant to show the viewer that this adventure is dangerous and death can come at any time, but the show fails to follow that up with any actual peril for the characters. Not a single other named character in the series dies or is really ever even in what feels like serious danger.But that\'s really not the worst thing about the plot in this show. The thing that absolutely kills this series dead is the way it just spins its wheels without doing anything.  The writing is embarrassingly sloppy and it actually feels unfinished in spots.  Like someone wrote an outline for a script and then never actually wrote the rest of it.  Lore elements like ""towers"" and ""princesses"" are introduced as mysteries and then simply never explained, not even by the end of the series.  Characters are vaguely gestured at being evil but then the show just forgets to show them actually doing anything evil or explaining why they\'re bad  There\'s no forward momentum to the plot, the characters just fuck around doing side quests in various nearly-identical looking colonies, which makes the adventure part of the series seem aimless and uninteresting.  By the end of the series, nothing has been resolved or explained since the series wasted its entire runtime on irrelevant side stories that had nothing to do with the main plot of Memempu seeking the tower.  After 10 episodes of doing nothing, it eventually drops the entire plot on you all at once in one of the most graceless infodumps imaginable, involving the characters literally sitting in a theater and watching another character give a powerpoint presentation about the main conflict that had been lightly teased a few times in earlier episodes.  The final battle is resolved by Memempu crying a bunch and making the villain feel bad so he just leaves and it ends on a screen that might as well say ""please buy the light novel"" in all caps. It\'s a complete, irredeemable mess from start to finish.Audio: The only positive thing I have to say about this entire series is that OP slaps.Visual: It actually looks pretty good in a few spots, especially the last episode, but the lack of creativity in the writing leads to boring scenery and backgrounds, and the CGI for the mechs and kaiju ranges between ""barely acceptable"" and ""low poly PS2 graphics"".Characters: It\'s pretty rare to see a show where every single major character annoys the hell out of you, but Sakugan manages the feat.  The series leads, Memempu and Gagumber, spend the overwhelming majority of the series bickering with each other like children and I spent entire episodes just wanting to scream ""shut the fuck up"" at both of them through the screen.  They are so hateable that I couldn\'t get emotionally invested at all in the father-daughter relationship that it tries to make the heart of the series.  Memempu is a precocious and arrogant brat and Gagumber is an idiot manchild who\'s even less mature than his 9 year old daughter.  Far from wanting to see them grow and understand each other as people, I instead wanted a falling kaiju to take them out like Lynda and Walsh so I wouldn\'t have to listen to their shit anymore.  Zackletu and Yuri are also there, but have very little personality and contribute even less to the story, mostly getting sidelined any time there are plot developments or major scenes.  Merooro is the closest thing this series has to a good character, but he appears too infrequently and the series is too invested in keeping him and the Bureau of Regulation shrouded in mystery to do anything interesting involving him.  The story is bad, but the awful characters are really what elevates this from being a standard mediocre anime into one of the worst things to come out in 2021.

Like yes this anime had an interesting plot, but being limit to 12 episode for alot of the story made it it's downfall from a masterpiece. I love the atmosphere and the story, and it seems they'll continue for maybe another season. So hopefully story telling will be better the next season because I do enjoy this anime besides the fact of the fast story telling and the fast introduction of characters just to quickly become side characters that don't matter much-------OG thoughts below of Episodes 1-11________Should you watch? Too put it bluntly, I...don't recommend this anime this anime likes to speed run through a couple of situations and character development, story has interesting feats that keeps you wondering, but its that fast paced story telling that made me say no.Thoughts: This anime starts off good, and could've easily been a masterpiece, but as it progressed the story became fast paced and all over the place. Like one episode seemed like it should've been like two, and that happens with a couple of episodes. At first I was like I want to see what's next. Then I was like hm do I want to keep watching because it's kinda going all over the place. With the recent episode 11 it reminded me of some questions I had which is keeping me invested in this story. The two side characters that follow the main two had one episode each for backstory, but then went on like they're story really didn't matter. And then one important thing happened with one of the main characters and a side character that just popped out of no where, and then after they fought the moment was never resolved. But they just continued the adventure. The story itself seem like it would be great if they slowed the pacing a bit, and prolonged it into 24 episodes instead of 12. And then an evil organization appears out of no where so late into the series like um ok. I would drop this anime if they didn't have some interesting factors that keep me wondering what's going on. Like the Kaiju, rainbow children, etc.Art: Its good I like it.Sound: I like the opening and ending like most anime lolCharacters: Only the relationship between the father and daughter are really good. Anything else character wise kinda gets put down because they're trying to speed run through the story.Overall: Honest can't say if this is worth watching. I like a few of the characters, but it's just they went through the story quickly that it hurts they're development and the show.

You have been warned.This is one disappointing anime. It started off pretty promising with Gurren Lagann-esque feeling in it\'s first few episodes. But it quickly fell off because of how the direction of the story went.It got too episodic with it\'s plot which is a turn-off for most people. It also didn\'t help that with each episode, every cast seems to revert back to their initial personality every time just for them to ""develop"" at the end of each episode. It makes the cast and their relationship feels fake and forced. It\'s not a very good way for episodic format.Another one...of this anime\'s problems is how inconsistent the narrative is. It also left off on a pretty lackluster end with how they f*cked up with their ""mystery"" aspect. Shouldn\'t have revealed everything to the audience if they\'re not planning on ending 12 episodes. It just gonna feel rush and out of place considering the other episodes wasn\'t really building up for that ""thing"" to be revealed in just 12 episodes.The animation is pretty good with just a little off-models here and there, but overall still good. The CG is pretty iffy though, but it\'s not bad. Just... it could be better.The music is pretty good. Nothing really to say about it. The OST wasn\'t mind blowingly good or anything, just serviceable. The opening and ending was also just fine.Overall, it\'s an anime with a lot of promise, but I dunno what happened, maybe it tripped before the finish line.(5.2/10) of this anime\'s problems is how inconsistent the narrative is.

The show started off with a cute drama filled father-daughter dynamic. It had a simple goal of a Memempu finding the place of her dreams. Then it started adding new characters with wacky comedic hijinks. It became more of journey type show where the team go to one location, something really bad happens, and in the next episode they'd briefly mention it and move on. The show got more and more predictable plots and kept delivering stagnate humor. IDK how else to explain it, the show a boring...mess with missed potential. Watch if you want but your not going to get that same delicious taste as in the first episode. mess with missed potential. Watch if you want but your not going to get that same delicious taste as in the first episode."", 'Sakugan is an example that shows that no matter how good a story\'s worldbuilding mixed with top-tier production values is, good characterization is the absolute base necessity for it all to mesh together. After all, stories are supposed to be about PEOPLE; but Sakugan seems more concerned with smashing together as many cool elements as possible while doing the absolute bare minimum with character writing.What\'s most disappointing about this series is that it had the potential to be the next mecha icon along with landmarks like Gundam and Gurren Lagann. The art and animation mixed with the jazzy, catchy soundtrack offer hours of splendor to...drink in, and the mech designs are some of the most distinct and visually pleasing I\'ve ever seen--particularly the series\' unofficial face Big Tony. But all of that gorgeous attention to detail is constantly interrupted by the series\' grating main protagonist, Memempu, and a slew of plot points that zip around all over the place if it will create some kind of conflict. Character motivations and attitudes will shift to absurd degrees even to the point of getting deadly, but then the character that character was after somehow manages to survive such a horrible injury and they both forgive each other like there was never any bad blood just because the target admitted that he had been in the wrong.Then there\'s the problem of the dynamic between Memempu and her father, Gugumber. There\'s a quote by Jesse Ventura that says, ""I\'d rather my kids have an average intelligence and common sense instead of being geniuses who have no common sense."" Memempu is the embodiment of that phrase. For as knowledgeable as she is about physics and the like, she may be one of the stupidest anime protagonists ever written. Her father is supposed to be the logical foil to her. He\'s a drunk and a bit of a failure when it comes to his own life, but he\'s got the common sense where it counts to care for his daughter and get everyone through the Labyrinth safely.Too bad he\'s constantly lambasted by every other character for his shortcomings even when he is so obviously in the right, while Memempu is simultaneously praised for being so smart and driven despite her actions sometimes landing them all in hot water. The last few episodes are actually surprisingly good, at least, with a profound message in episode 11 and actual character development for Memempu, which naturally leads to a huge climax and revelation in episode 12 and the true depth of Memempu\'s and Gugumber\'s familial love shown in earnest.I\'m not going to lie that I\'m actually interested in seeing a second season, because there are hints that things could get better provided the author of the novel recognizes his own narrative shortcomings later on, not to mention this underground dystopia is one of the most fascinating anime worlds I\'ve ever seen. But unless that necessity becomes so, this has just been another crapped-out light novel adaptation from a steadily stagnating industry that is more concerned with making money off of the current disposable season of anime rather than making a modern classic that will be remembered decades from now--no matter how sexy Zackletu\'s abs and legs are. drink in, and the mech designs are some of the most distinct and visually pleasing I\'ve ever seen--particularly the series\' unofficial face Big Tony.

That would be Memenpu, an over achieving daughter with big dreams of leaving the colony and becoming a “marker” (adventurer) to explore the labyrinth and find the place in her dreams, and Gagumber, an over-protective father who’s kind of dumb, drinks a lot and isn’t all that...thrilled about his daughter leaving the colony.What makes this show really stand out from most of falls offering is how well animated it is. For a show called Sakugan is delivers Sakuga animation almost constantly. For a time I thought the was a studio Trigger production so when I discovered that it was in fact a Satelight production I was impressed. Characters are highly expressive and dynamic to match their over-the-top personalities, especially Memenpu and Gagumber who constantly get into verbal tussles and it’s fun to watch.I like the core cast of Memenpu, Gagumber, Zachletu and Yuri. Zachletu and Yuri are nice compliments to the overall chaotic nature of the group however they don’t really do anything of real importance within the story until the very last episode. Of course Memenpu and Gagumber are the main focus and reason to watch. Their relationship with each other is strained as they don’t know how to open up to each other and are too stubborn to try, but they also compliment each others strengths and weaknesses and have to learn to rely on each other more as the show goes on which leads to some really sweet and satisfying moments and learning experiences for the both of them.If you’re watching for the mech vs “kaijuu” then you may be a little disappointed depending on how much you invest in mech vs kaijuu battles. Their aren’t really that many throughout the show as it spends a lot of time colony hopping and world building so be warned.Sakugan is a charming anime about learning to rely on and accept family. It’s story can feel a little lacklustre at times, but if you like Gurren Lagann x Saturday morning nonsense then I don’t think I need to say anything else.7/10 Good. thrilled about his daughter leaving the colony.What makes this show really stand out from most of falls offering is how well animated it is.

It is solid but there are some concerns as some of the CGI used is of questionable quality. The second episode also follows with more action set-pieces but again the weak CGI is there for all to see. It actually made me a little apprehensive going further but if you have fears of this CGI animation stifling your enjoyment, I can gladly say that this fear is largely unfounded as the...computerised imagery is toned way more after the first two episodes.The next segment after these episodes is what I consider the weakest part of the anime as while the show wants to highlight the sense of adventure that this world offers, the lack of an overall narrative really does hurt the enjoyability of this show. It can be a slog especially if you are not keen on the character of Memempu but if you persist then you will be rewarded.This is because Sakugan is largely an anime of two halves as the first half is largely episodic with no real discernible plotline. It is the main weakness of the show and will likely cause a lot of viewers to check out which is unfortunate considering the second half was far better when the story finally gets going. For example, we get some further character drama with the often-turbulent relationship between Gagumber and Memempu. It is not just drama though as scattered across all these episodes are plenty of decent battle sequences.For all the strength these arcs possess there is one issue and this comes from how the proceeding arc begins. The transitions between arcs are clumsy as the shift is both jarring and the reactions from the characters misplaced. It is not a showstopper but it is enough that it can draw you out of your immersion. Still due to the quality of what happens next it is a flaw that was easy to overlook due to the strength of the escalating tensions both in the drama and story narrative.Naturally this drama and action all reach a climax in the season finale were many of the earlier plot points are pieced together and we get the most emotionally charged scenes of the series. It was a good send off for Sakugan although I will say it still left a lot of things hanging by opening itself up for a sequel. That could be a reason to drop for some but there was enough closure in this one that it left me both satisfied and added to my overall enjoyment. Like most things in Sakugan it is a good point but with a caveat attached.Speaking of caveats one of the potential pitfalls I see will come from the characterisation of the main characters particularly Memempu. The girl, while intelligent is very headstrong, stubborn and is prone to rage and impulsive actions. Like a lot of kids, she is slow on the uptake on interpersonal issues and she will have you wincing with the stuff she says to her father. Not everyone is going to like it especially when you consider her reactions after some major arcs. To me, I felt it was decent way of conveying the difficulties of a child particularly a teenager but it is a point worth mentioning. People can find her irritating if you are inclined that way.Gagumber is not without his problem either as there were moments of frustration I had with him who seemed, at times to be prone for moments of madness not to mention being given the idiot ball for no good reason but to add drama. In fairness several characters do pick up on these traits but still, it makes for difficult viewing. As for the secondary cast, they are all pretty decent and they do their jobs well enough but are not particularly noteworthy save for one who does play a major part in one plot point.Animation/music:The standard of animation in Sakugan is decent but there are several scenes littered throughout when the quality does take a noticeable dip. Moreover, the CGI sequences are glaring and poorly integrated to the main animation making it a bit of an eyesore. Things do improve in this front as the CGI is deployed less frequently after the second episode and what CGI we do get is integrated in a more effective manner.The biggest strength Sakugan has though is the animation sequences with both the opening AND ending sequences which I felt was fantastic. Often, I skip over these scenes after watching them a couple of times but because of its quality I couldn’t get enough of it! It’s not just the great animation but also the accompanying music which was both catchy and enjoyable. These OP/ED could perhaps be the best this season has to offer! The opening song is ""Koukotsu Labyrinth"" by Masaaki Endoh while the ending track is ""Shine "" by MindaRyn.Summary:The big problem plaguing Sakugan is that of pacing. It takes quite some time for this show to get going but once you get to the half way point Sakugan really ups its game. If there is one main weakness in this second half it would be the transitions between the arcs which was executed in a rather clumsy fashion on account of the character reactions. Still the amount of character drama, action and good storytelling with good use of foreshadowing means this weakness is easy to overlook.The other point of contention will come from the character of Memempu who does have an abrasive/arrogant personality that can rub people the wrong way. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea but she is not a simple tsundere archetype meaning she is a somewhat original personality and is therefore more engaging. A degree of patience is needed but she does grow and has a greater understanding over her feelings that she has trouble containing/expressing.If you like shows with character drama then Sakugan will be for you as there is plenty of that going around. The fact this drama centres on a father and daughter combination means the character dynamic is somewhat unique especially if you consider the world background. Outside of the mains there is joy to be had with the environments as each colony is different and has its own character keeping things fresh. In the end this a good series that was hampered with a few flaws; if it was not for those shortcomings this would be a series I would recommend.Story 7 – Chief problems are the pacing issues and the way this series moves from one arc to the next. On the positive side the opener is a banger of an episode and if you can manage to reach the second half of Sakugan then things really do pick up. The ending is also good and emotionally charged but caution should be exercised on account the ending begs a sequel. Despite this opening ending you are left satisfied and not frustrated.Characters 7 – Memempu could be a little too hot to handle! She is a handful and can turn off viewers. However, the character dynamic between Memempu and her father is novel enough to keep people interested. There are ups and downs with this tumultuous relationship so prepare to be given the run around! It doesn’t end there as a secondary character also steps in to create further drama. If you like character drama then Sakugan has it in spades!Animation/music 7.5 – The standard for the series on a whole is probably closer to a six with numerous scenes suffering from a deterioration in quality. It is the great opening and ending sequences that elevates this score as not only is the animation great but the music was also stellar as the tracks are worth listening to repeatedly!Overall 7 – A potential recommendation that fell short because of flaws in its storytelling. Outside the opener the first half of Sakugan is a bit of a slog but things do improve noticeably after that point. If you like adventure series sprinkled with a heavy dose of character drama then this is one to recommend. This counts double if you like Memempu due to her spirited nature which could be a potential pain point for some. computerised imagery is toned way more after the first two episodes.The next segment after these episodes is what I consider the weakest part of the anime as while the show wants to highlight the sense of adventure that this world offers, the lack of an overall narrative really does hurt the enjoyability of this show.

The first two or three episodes are well-paced and invest in Gaganber's and Memenpo's relationship as a parent and child who are complete opposites of each other.

Will Memepu and Gagumber reach the place of Memepu's dreams or will the conflict between rebels and authority stop them in their tracks?Story & Characters: 5/10Sakugan had a really interesting premise...which is not uncommon in Mecha/Post-Apocalyptic animanga. However, instead of your typical shounen main character and friends it's a father-daughter crew. It's too bad that the events didn't hold much progressive value to the character compatibility; Many of the obstacles on their journey felt padded in order to implement that father-daughter dynamic especially with Memepu's very obnoxious demeanor and Gagumber's dismissive attitude to Memepu. Apart from the two, there is a lot of mystery among the side characters we barely get insight into the crew that help Memepu and Gagumber after their initial encounters which makes their integration in the end feel a lot more superficial. Overall, the story could have had more substance if it had meaningful events and more active characters. (Special note: Memepu in the beginning is very unbearable, she is clearly capable of weighing risks but time and time again she chooses to do her own thing which leads to a lot of unnecessary risk)Art & Sound: 6/10The Kaiju CGI was pretty well executed as well as most of the Mecha sequences.

Kind of.For people new to Sakugan and wondering whether or not they should watch it, here\'s a segment from my preliminary review:""This show is the epitome of wanderlust and ambition, told from the perspective of a father daughter pair. The thing with this show is you don\'t have to be a mecha or action/adventure junkie to enjoy it. This show simply just does so well at putting into practice the ""show, not tell"" mantra with character development and storytelling all done in a...dynamic fashion, and the OST for this show all around just slaps.""To put it very simply, Sakugan is Journey of Elaina except Elaina is 10 years younger and traveling with her dad, and the setting is steampunk instead of magical fantasy.I definitely still consider this show the best one-off seasonal show this season, and thus still think it is horridly underwatched and underrated. Sakugan has an AMAZING first episode. In my preliminary review I compared it to the first episode of Steins;Gate and I still stand by that. However, having a fantastic first episode leads to very high expectations. Even having thoroughly enjoyed Sakugan myself, I can definitively say that not all of those expectations were delivered by the show. While the rest of the show wasn\'t a letdown by any means, it was definitely a weak followup to the first episode for one big reason. Sakugan follows an episodic story structure where each episode kinda loosely connects to each other but for the most part it is a discontinuous narrative split into one small anecdote per episode.The episodic story structure is most likely what most people are disappointed about, which is understandable. If you came here for a bedtime story that reads cohesively from start to finish, you definitely came to the wrong place. However, as shows like Yuru Yuri, Odd Taxi, and Journey of Elaina have demonstrated, you don\'t need to have a cohesive main narrative to be a good show.From here I\'ll be discussing the overall shortcomings and strengths of Sakugan. I\'m confident I can just namedrop plotpoints without context to serve as examples in such a way that completely avoids direct spoilers, so yay, spoiler-free review.The first episode of Sakugan set up A LOT of foreshadowing, whether it be about Gagumber\'s past (Gale-force and Rufus), Memenpu\'s absent mother, the mysterious Urorop, the kaijuu\'s true origins, and the Bureau of Regulation. This really highlighted how ambitious this production was, and because they foreshadowed so hard, any experienced media consumer would be expect all those foreshadowed points to be addressed throughout the show. In reality, most of those mysteries were only half-addressed and some were straight up ignored, which left the viewers with more mysteries at the end than at the start. It just seems like Sakugan expected to cover a lot more ground than they actually were able to in a single season, or that this was supposed to be a multi-season entry. Either way, this was by far the show\'s biggest shortcoming and that is being very clearly represented in my 4/10 for the story. However, this is where I think the flaws of this show end because everything else is very well done and enjoyable.Rather than as an incomplete story, I see Sakugan as a character driven show that is very ambitious with its setting and world building. The Labyrinth is a mystical subterranean world straight out of folklore. The episodic story structure really helped show off as much of this world as possible, because it wouldn\'t have been possible to show off as many colonies, environments, characters, and mini narratives if Sakugan had to be concerned about how cohesive the end result would be. The raw expansiveness and diversity of the people and places that Memenpu encounters on her journey gives a lot of opportunity to stress test her relationship with Gagumber, and leads to a lot of authentic interactions.I feel that the characters in Sakugan are done especially well because its rare to see this type of parent-child relationship in anime. You hardly see parents even get involved with the main character and when they do, they\'re usually scumbag caretakers that traumatized and abused their child. Gagumber is an awful parent by most standards. He\'s an alcoholic slob who likes to gamble and has a short temper. Among all of those bad qualities though, his love for Memenpu really shines in the way that he tries to care for her. He may stumble, and not know what exactly to do, but he\'ll always do SOMETHING because it will always be better than doing NOTHING for his daughter. Meanwhile, Memenpu is adamant about her own self-proclaimed maturity and independence, insisting she doesn\'t need a deadbeat dad like Gagumba to accompany her. Throughout the entire show, she attempts to use her material achievements in her education and career to supplant her worldly inexperience and naivety.Memenpu\'s journey is a journey about growing up, but not in the conventional way that people expect. Many people were dissatisfied with how she didn\'t mature throughout each episode, and I think this is a misguided expectation. Sakugan is a story of Gagumber traveling with Memenpu on her journey; however, he\'s not traveling with her to watch her grow up. He\'s traveling with her so she doesn\'t have to. Memenpu and Gagumber encounter many people on their journey: adults who made bad choices, adults who made difficult choices, adults who never had a chance to even choose, and adults who wished they could choose again. Throughout all of these encounters Gagumber was there at Memenpu\'s side, ensuring that she didn\'t have to make any of those grown-up choices, that she could keep her eyes forward on her childish dream.Life is a journey where everyone will be grown up at the end whether they like it or not, but what matters is how they grew up. This analogy can be literally applied to the show itself, and is the main reason why I weigh Sakugan\'s strengths so much more versus its shortcomings. Because when you go on a journey it isn\'t about where you end up, but how you got there.P.S. All right, if you\'ve read my Egao no Daika review then you know what time it is! An ambitious character driven show with transforming mechs, riveting social commentary, and banger OST? That\'s right, welcome to the Xenoblade Chronicles X corner! I definitely cannot deny that a lot of my hype and leniency for this show stems from its parallels with Xenoblade Chronicles X. I mean I did say at the beginning of this review that this show is pretty much functionally identical to Majo no Tabitabi except Elaina got an 8 from me and Sakugan got a 9. I truly, truly cannot emphasize enough how much of an impact Xenoblade Chronicles X has made on me and how horridly underrated and underplayed it is. Xenoblade Chronicles X doesn\'t have a very cohesive main story, but there\'s just so much heart put into the overall theme that connects the mini narratives in the game just like with Sakugan. A lot of the reason Xenoblade Chronicles X isn\'t very popular is because the only console it was released on, the Wii U, was not very popular. Additionally, I think people went in with a lot of misguided expectations expecting it to be the sequel to Xenoblade Chronicles when it wasn\'t meant to be anything of the sort. Misguided expectations often leads to disappointment, but just because something didn\'t meet your misplaced expectations doesn\'t mean that it wasn\'t a good product. I feel like a lot of response to this show can be put under this umbrella, so that\'s one of the main motivations with which I wrote this review. dynamic fashion, and the OST for this show all around just slaps.""To put it very simply, Sakugan is Journey of Elaina except Elaina is 10 years younger and traveling with her dad, and the setting is steampunk instead of magical fantasy.I definitely still consider this show the best one-off seasonal show this season, and thus still think it is horridly underwatched and underrated. Sakugan has an AMAZING first episode. In my preliminary review I compared it to the first episode of Steins;Gate and I still stand by that. However, having a fantastic first episode leads to very high expectations. Even having thoroughly enjoyed Sakugan myself, I can definitively say that not all of those expectations were delivered by the show.

Well, the first 15 seconds of the first episode sequence is over-animated quite nicely. That's about it.Sakugan features a father daughter duo combo that is determined to find the place Memempu dreamed about. Of course, that's not the reason why the anime sucks.The anime sucks because half of the anime is comedy sequences done by the father daughter duo, in which they bicker like idiots. I'm not averse to such types of humor, but it's a bit repetitive, and the Father's really childish to be stooping down to Memempu's level.Memempu is innocent, naive, only...nine years old for god's sake, but is also extremely smart (which you can totally tell because the show shoves in your face about how she has super amazing inventions and graduated university already). Seriously, a nine year old kid that has the maturity of one, yet possesses a quick-tempered and lacks any sort of planning other than the times in the show where she somehow calculates the entire geometry of a cavern in five seconds to create a hole in the ground that aligns with the caverns so that the monsters can get sucked in.Even the father, despite being a veteran in the Marker business, clearly has a past where he's lost good friends, still behaves like a moron and stoops down to Memempu's level in order for there to be bickering and fighting, when he should be more of a role model, where he reigns in Memempu's recklessness and acts as an unmovable stone, rather than the type of character he is.Memempu is exposed to the brutality of the Marker business early on: she witnesses her best friend die to a monster. There's a touching scene where she's sad, but still determined, which is fine, but the next episode, she's still as rash as ever, and making decisions that would endanger her own life and her father's just due to hubris or some naive/selfish decision.There's no character development to speak of, and the anime just goes at a lightning pace in order to get to other parts of the story which are as bland as ever. This, appended with the fact that the CGI's nothing to write home about, and you got a recipe for disaster. nine years old for god's sake, but is also extremely smart (which you can totally tell because the show shoves in your face about how she has super amazing inventions and graduated university already).

Sorairo Utility,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50209/Sorairo_Utility,"[""Honestly for a 15 minute special this was really a pleasant surprise and a super fun watch. Most of the time I don't expect much from CGDCT anime since quality is often low, especially when sports are involved, but this special left me wanting so much more and really wishing/hoping that this gets a full anime season.As someone who golfs fairly frequently, but obviously dealt with the frustrations of being a novice amongst my better peers, this was relatable, fun, and gave me the nostalgic vibes of when I was first starting out. Also, while animation quality is not crazy (as you'd expect from...a short special), the fact that they still made sure to focus on the differences in the stances depending on the club that you're using was really nice and refreshing to see. In case you didn't notice this because you're unfamiliar with golf, just pay attention to the difference in lean and elbow position when Minami is using the driver vs. when she's putting.All in all, I thought the premise was fun, the girls were very cute, and I really enjoyed watching it!

That ending song is very good and is still stuck in my head at the moment. The characters, for being in just this...one short episode, already managed to establish themselves as likeable people. Minami might be a really insecure girl going into high school, but looking at the golf ball near her get shot up into the air makes it the first time she takes a glance at the sky from what I am assuming is coming from her constant shrugging after she started classes.

The three old men of the club are the main highlight, Windy\'s Father seems like the leader of the group, the Einstein look man is funny, he is a bit of a perv flipping a couple of girls skirts and is the main source of the comedy, the other member stays rather quiet and isn\'t really involved in the plot but is always around. Not forgetting of course Miss China has a few cameo roles.Art is rather simple and seems a little dated like something from the 90s rather than 2001 but the landscape shots were nice and it didn\'t effect the show it self. Animation wasn\'t terrible, it wasn\'t great either, something like a motorbike heading of in the distance didn\'t even become smaller as it faded off, characters were all well drawn and stayed proportion mostly.Sound is decent, the general background noises were bland, the sound of trees and the wind blowing were what you would expect them to sound like but wasn\'t much variety in it. No music stood out, it all fit nicely into the scenes and the credits song was a cool big band type song and was a decent listen to.Overall for an hours worth of OAV spread oout over two episode you can\'t go wrong, especially if you enjoyed the prequal as this gave off a very similar feeling to it, its got a clam feel about it and is something to sit back and relax, there are no bad guys to worry about, no one to get into the way of out characters, a nice gentle comedy that will make you go \'D\'aaaawwww\' a few times. it gives.I said it gives a warm atmosphere but looking at the setting you can\'t help but feel a little chilly, its always snowing, but this does provide a nice touch to the landscape shots.

Trava: Fist Planet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1980/Trava__Fist_Planet,"[""STORY: 6Well, the story is quite basic, we start off with two characters, Trava and Shinkai, on board of a spaceship. They are freelancers, and their current job is to travel and survey an unknown planet. They find an object drifting in space, and locate a girl inside of it who seems to have lost her memories. Sound familiar?The story doesn't start off partcularly exciting, but it's enough to keep you interested. Eventually, the trio ends up landing on the planet and realise that there are some crazy things going on there. The problem is, the story does seem random, while that can work,...like in FLCL, here it feels a bit awkward. The show explains that Trava and Shikai hope to collect money to be able to enter a sort of mecha suit battle tournament, but the anime ends before any of that takes place. It seems like they had more story to show us, but ended up just wrapping up the show in 4 short episodes.ART: 8Best part of the anime. The art is really creative and different, kind of a mix of a Aeon Flux and Mind Game. This will turn off some people, but if you value art and like creative applications of it, this OVA is for you. The character designs are very funky and sometime silly(the female character's huge hips) but i found them very interesting. Overall, i found it to be stylish and eye catching.SOUND: 6Fair for the most part. Nothing really memorable here, but it works and none of the music felt out of place. Pretty solid overall. The voice acting was very good and fit the funkyness of the characters.CHARACTER: 7Well, this one was hard to judge. There is no character development here, but in some cases that can be a good thing. We are introduced to several eccentric characters and, in the end, it is fun to observe their actions and mannerisms, so i decided to go with a positive score.ENJOYMENT: 6I liked this overall, but it could have been much more, it's simply too short to be impressive. Now, short anime can be wonderful, but here it felt like a 12 episode anime cropped into a tiny 4 episodes of 13 minutes each. If you don't care about art, or don't like this kind of animation/character design, subtract two points here.Overall score: 7 like in FLCL, here it feels a bit awkward.

I love just how strange the sci-fi world in Redline was, and we get to see even more of it here, even if it isn\'t nearly as entertaining. I\'m not normally a fan of this very ""Adult Swim""-esque risque and racy sci-fi world, but for some reason Redline, and Trava by extension, work very well for me.I feel like I\'d have enjoyed this way more, except that this only had Hungarian subtitles, and the English ones refused to load. Some...of these characters were real big mumblers, I\'ll tell ya that. Very hard to understand mumbling. Speak up! of these characters were real big mumblers, I\'ll tell ya that. Very hard to understand mumbling. Speak up!', ""I watched this completely blind with no knowledge of Redline or really anything about it. This anime frustrates me because while alot of aspects aren't that great, it is *just* slightly away from being 'so bad it's good', ending up in this weird void between 'What the hell did I just watch?' and 'What the hell was the point?'I really struggled to find any cohesive story or plot while watching, it's a complete mess of criss-crossing plotlines that just don't go anywhere or feel at all compelling. I can acknowledge that OVAs often have to cut back plot but this one just spews lore at...you like a machine gun, with most of it only ever being explained at the end. Alot of it is cliche at best, and at the end there doesn't feel like any sort of resolution because nothing's been established properly. It feels like an attempt to imitate the style of FLCL or Project A-Ko, but without understanding why those work.The audio just isn't anything really. I can't remember a single piece of music after watching and the voice actors seem to either emote in an apathetic mumble or while screaming at the top of their lungs which just makes them annoying. Characters also seem to cut eachother off constantly which while funny a few times, just completely breaks the flow of conversations making them feel awkward.The only real reason I carried on was the animation, which really is superb though not surprising considered it's Madhouse. All of the environments are hand-drawn which makes them look retro but still very detailed. The smoothness of movement transitions is really strong and clearly alot of work went into them. While I appreciated the dramatic use of foreshortening and strange character designs, in alot of cuts they just end up looking awkward or hard to interpret. The princess character's pelvis in particular just makes her look aesthetically unappealing when viewed at any angle other than straight-on. you like a machine gun, with most of it only ever being explained at the end.

Yami Shibai 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22537/Yami_Shibai_2,"[""Story:Far more cerebral than the previous season. And, while it's somewhat interesting to contemplate the themes in each episode, I'm not watching Yami Shibai Season 2 for mind puzzles, I'm watching it because I liked how Season 1 handled horror creep so well. All in all, maybe 3 episodes were what I was hoping for, 4 had something worth deconstructing, and the rest were downright boring. There's even some strange script issues which become increasingly apparent with the episode Funeral Confessional. You'll know what I mean if you pay close attention.Art:Same as before, but it forsakes the opportunity to use different forms of animation for...different scares. Also, it feels a lot cleaner, which is something I wasn't hoping for. I liked the rustic look of the previous season.Sound:Roughly the same experience as the previous season, but there was more abuse of audio scares as opposed to creating a proper sense of ambience.Character:Again, same deal. Enough to work for each section. However, I do feel it necessary to bump this score up one more notch because the emphasis on cerebral tones requires a little more characterization, and I felt that was achieved in some areas.Enjoyment:Not that enjoyable.

Keep in mind I watched all three seasons of Yami Shibai back to back, and there was a notable decrease in the story quality as I went on. There are more morals this season and a lot of them are blatantly obvious and a poor decision to add to a series that really doesn't need morals (more morals means turning more characters into complete jerks too, making you want the characters to suffer even more by the end of the episode). I don't remember many of the...episodes this season, nor the stories (I'm writing this review a day after I watched it). However that's not to say there weren't any GOOD episodes in there, heck my second favorite episode out of the whole series came from this season. However, there wasn't enough in this season to really make it stand out. The art style this season, however, did seem to stay more consistent than the first season's and there was even a bit of improvement this time around.

In a lot of ways season two is worse than season one but in some ways I think season two is actually better than one.The writing\'s overall quality is improved in the sense that even though the bad episodes aren\'t scary they\'re at least interesting. What hasn\'t changed is that some stories feel like they were written by or for children. In episode 11 the moral of the story is literately ""Plagiarism is bad"" which is like ???? obviously we all knew that? Thanks mom for reminding me to play nicely lol. The way...they go about telling the story is still interesting but by the end of the episode you feel quite unsatisfied nonetheless.If you enjoyed the first season you should definitely give this one a try but don\'t expect to be scared that often. Episode seven is a must-watch if your\'re asking me, it\'s has some really nice horror. I\'d also recommend episodes three, four, nine and ten if you want to be scared/creeped out.

I still remember most of the art from season one, but I can’t say the same for this season. They...definitely put less work into making the monsters disturbing which was pretty disappointing.SoundSound was creepy in a few episodes, but they overused the jump scare “THUD” way too much. Season two tried to jump scare you every three seconds while season one would play quiet noises such as crickets or water droplets to make you anticipate a jump scare. There are also a few moments that were meant to be scary, but because of the sound choices they just come off as funny.CharacterFor 4 minutes I guess they did pretty good. it’s a little hard to judge with this short a duration, but I still feel like the way the characters would talk and the facial expressions they would make in season one made you like them more than season 2.EnjoymentDespite the fact everything else was lackluster, since each episode was short I never got bored.

All from ILCA, the studio behind the unimpressive Kowabon. I have reviewed the first series. So, I thought it might be interesting to look at the second for this year\'s horror anime month.Story:This series follows the same pattern as the first. We open with an old narrator calling on nearby children to join him for the show. Then there\'s a horror short for about four minutes and the ending credits.The biggest issue remains the same. The stories largely don\'t have much in terms of subversion. There are...maybe two or three where you can\'t readily figure out where the episode is going a half a minute in. Which does significantly waken the impact.That being said, I do appreciate the rapid fire format. I do think it works well for horror and the stories themselves feel like sitting around a campfire and telling ghost stories. Maybe they aren\'t the best stories but if you\'re in the right mood for it and the ambience is good, it\'s an enjoyable time. The pacing is also well executed. ILCA is good at utilising their time well and using build up to make that final moment before the ending credits roll pop.Characters:I maintain that the narrator is pointless. I get that they\'re going for a ""this old man is telling the stories"" thing, but all he does is say ""step up, this is the story of a college student"" or some such thing. He doesn\'t provide any useful narration or really add anything. You could literally have the same impact without him.In general, the characters are fine. They don\'t have much depth but they serve their purpose well enough. You can\'t reasonably expect much more than that given the very limited time each episode has.Art:I have to admit, the children\'s paper puppet aesthetic is kind of growing on me. It might not be an ideal look for a horror series, but it does work with the overall idea of the series as a street performance.Sound:The acting is decent enough. It\'s hard to tell if the actors would be really good if they had more depth to their characters or not, simply because every character is only there for one episode. They kind of sound like they\'re doing the bare minimum though. The music is fine, nothing spectacular.Ho-yay:There isn\'t any to be seen.Areas of Improvement:1. Stop wasting time with the narrator.2. Break away from expectations. Yes, this is a horror series for younger audiences. But if you think younger audiences can\'t figure out where you\'re going with a formulaic story I would say you\'re under-estimating them. I think those youngsters who are a bit sharper and are somewhat familiar with the genre will see the scares coming most of the time.3. Give the Actors some stronger direction. Even with the low characterisation, the performances could be stronger.Final Thoughts:Like the first instalment in the series, this is okay. If you want some rapid fire horror that isn\'t much of a time investment, you may enjoy it. If you want subversion, complex characters or a story with some meat to it, you\'ll be better off with something else. I\'m giving it a 6/10. maybe two or three where you can\'t readily figure out where the episode is going a half a minute in. Which does significantly waken the impact.That being said, I do appreciate the rapid fire format.

Take for example one episode that was based on a genii of sorts. While some research was done having done a through one would have stopped that evil event from occurring. Reinforcing the point that letter A (smart) has a higher value than a C(average) than just on paper. Not convinced i will explain further from an example of my life. I used to work processing film. While i understood the basics of what was needed i thought i was a master. However,...when certain components did not function right like the film ended up completely blank rather than having the actual shots visible. I must have gone through 20 or so rolls before i figured out the problem from sheer trial and error. It was a minor fix that could have been avoided had i followed procedure as indicated in the manual for the machine. Since than i took that hard lesson to heart and at least attempted to familiarize myself with a new aspect if i were to be working with it. Having done so, i greatly reduced my amount of errors. In short had good morals for each episode.On a slightly negative aspect the plot for each episode somehow felt a tad decreased on the horror level. Maybe it is because of complaints from the first season given the age level it is marked for. Not a big impact decision for me but than again i am not a horror buff. Watching a single saw movie is enough for me.ArtRemained the same with the cutout/puppet like appearance. While that works for children those teens and adults who have grown accustomed to lips moving with the vocals and proper animation movement would be kind of annoyed. when certain components did not function right like the film ended up completely blank rather than having the actual shots visible.

Most of the episodes are just strange and/or make no sense. Still there were those few episodes that make me want to go on to watch the 3rd season.

Everything else is nice too)Sound: 7 (Lots of girl groaning in this show)Character: 8 (So... much... fanservice [/drools])Enjoyment: 9 (I enjoyed the hell out of it)Overall: 34/50 = 7.4 ~7.0 (It'll play with your emotions)...::FULL REVIEW::Ohkay okay, its time for a proper review of this piece. Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito (Yamibou for short) Is a heartwarming coming of age tale about a love between two super cute sisters. Their world gets torn apart when Hatsumi  mysteriously disappears into thin air right in front of her sister Hazuki. But as Hazuki is about to find out, theres more to this adventure than she realizes.The story itself feels something similar to an excel saga or magic shopping district in terms of overall feel with our main characters jumping into different 'books' and such. Don't worry it'll be explained to you pretty early. Hell in the first 6 minutes of episode one, you find out that theres girl love, incest, and drama. So this show knows that it's series is short and they compensate by trying to let you understand the Yamibou universe in detail. Of course this style of story telling is not immune to plot holes and inconsistencies, but they cover it very well with quite a gratuitous amount of fanservice.If your a fan of large boobs you'll definitely love this show. If not, just be prepared. There are more than enough fanservice shots in EVERY episode. Even during the heat of battle, one is not immune to losing a top or having entire sets of clothes dissolve in to thin air. It obviously doesn't progress the story whenever things like this happens but it is a good indicator at how well they managed to produce a fairly good quality show ...from an artistic standpoint. Every one of the girls were drawn with sexuality in mind. Head to toe, and from costume to bare skin, its all there obviously to cause quite a stir from the viewing audience.The characters are mostly made with a moe attitude in mind. You got your clumsy stupid girl, your tsundere, and even a silent type. Nothing is really new in the personality department (with the exception of the girl love), but you'll still feel intrigued as to what will happen next for Hazuki and company. Even the little side characters are cute as well. I laugh every time i hear that chicken :P Mind you, the characters aren't comparable to like a Key character (Kanon, Air, etc) But they are better than average.Overall it was a good anime viewing experience worth the 3+ hours watching it. Although I was sort of confused as to who this show was being catered towards because the overall story is very girl oriented, but the fanservice is very boy oriented. Either way, if you like the Alice in Wonderland style of story with loads of skin give this a shot. It'll play with your emotions. ::FULL REVIEW::Ohkay okay, its time for a proper review of this piece.

Throw in a batshit crazy fairy prince (Gargantua) who is a parody...of every ""heroic"" bishonen lead and his twisted reality involving a Princess, Mariel, whom he sacrifices only to watch a close friend, Ritsuko take the blame and punishment for him... Also a Kitsune woman with really large tits and her own censorship circle over her naughty bits.This is a beautiful mess of intertwining characters, random story arcs, all set to Hatsuki\'s quest trying to find Hatsumi/Eve--both driven by an eternal love and guilt. It\'s as weird as anime gets, but still manages to make sense while doing it--to some extent. All of the charcters seem real, driven by real emotions, like Eve, whose flippant desire to span the worlds of books leaves broken hearts in her wake and dooms those who have fallen in love with her to search her for eternity. Hatsuki and Gargantua are two such people, each with their own goals and desire for redemption (albeit Gargantua\'s is superficially absurd, a more touching motive is told through Ritsuko\'s backstory). Even the pervy Lilith, who despite wanting to molest Eve, doesn\'t want to be left alone to be the custodian of the library for all eternity while her sister plays with the hearts of others and leaves her to clean up the mess.It\'s weird, disjointed, introduces random characters from the parallel story arcs and breaks up the story line--but it all seems to work in spite of it all (with a surprisingly clear premise, motivated characters, and resolution) and makes for an entertaining way to kill an evening. of every ""heroic"" bishonen lead and his twisted reality involving a Princess, Mariel, whom he sacrifices only to watch a close friend, Ritsuko take the blame and punishment for him...

But I will try to keep the amount of spoilers low.It's advised that you not read this before you have completed the show, unless you don't mind to be spoiled. However, if you do have completed the show and are confused about something, feel free to check this long review.Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito, YamiBou(or Yamibou, Yamibo) for short, is arguably one of the hardest-to-review anime.Why so?...Say, for fluffy slice-of-life shows, the main factor is enjoyment value, for example how good the jokes are and how heartwarming the show is.For romance stories, the main factors are the characters and how they undergo character development etc.For shows which try to deliver serious stuff, the main factors are the symbols, the points the anime delivers, and also the characters etc.But YamiBou is not any of them, and there is hardly a clear principle on which 'prime factors' to choose. Also, though people may be turned off by the anime for one reason or another, there is one specific part of the anime which is not so easy to understand and requires some 'overinterpretation' skills to fully understand.So in this case let's analyse the anime first.--PLOT--The plot of YamiBou starts with two sisters, named Hadzuki(aka Hazuki/Haduki), and Hatsumi. Hadzuki has a crush on Hatsumi, and one night decides to sneak into her bedroom and go yuri-yuri with her. And anyone who have watched Ep01 knows what happens next.From then on the story then spans alpha, beta, and gamma(just joking) world lines and tells backstories of different people, while the main line of Hadzuki looking for Hatsumi still goes on.Events in the story become connected by Ep11 or so, and then comes the ending... Uh, forget it.The plot can be confusing at first as it is not told in a chronological order.The first problem we find with the anime is that many things are left UNEXPLAINED, some of them are even crucial. For example, we know that Eve always leaves her current world at the age of 16, but is this some rule that can not be changed? The interpretation of this results in different views on Eve. I assume that it indeed is some rule (but why this rule then...)Had the pacing of the anime been improved, for example had it focused less on Lilith's antics and more on the worldview and backstories, more things would have been explained.The story is mainly composed of 3 parts(technically not arcs):>The adventures of Hadzuki>The backstory of Gargantua and people around him>The backstory of Hadzuki with HatsumiWhile MAL lists the main characters as Lilith, Hadzuki and Hatsumi, in my opinion the real major characters are actually Hadzuki, Eve and Gargantua.The adventures of Hadzuki: Nothing special. Supposedly, the original visual novel has a bigger worldview and some of the events in the VN are adapted, but the events Hadzuki encounters are nothing spectacular. These bits and pieces add a bit to the fun factor, but are still distracting.The backstory of Gargantua: One of the better parts in the anime. This part is about a man who was driven to morbidity by his jealousness, and tells a series of rather depressing stories. It's not a bad choice for some specific aspects in this part be portrayed more lightheartedly, although whenever Lilith appears everything gets too lighthearted and moe.The backstory of Hadzuki with Hatsumi: The part that starts out quite good, but eventually made people gush loads of blood. But to look at it seriously, is it that bad? And is Eve that bad? (Note: Some people on a certain yuri-dedicated site called Yamibo do think so)**THERE ARE LIKELY MORE SPOILERS FROM NOW ON**--ABOUT EVE & THE ENDING--So what kind of character is Eve?Opinions differ between 'she is one who brings divine love to mankind' and 'she is just a hypocritic b**** who only wants to seek love interests in the human world'.Personally speaking, the former interpretation makes much more sense!And this is nothing hard to understand. Has Eve done anything in the book worlds without a heart of gold? And had Eve really been hypocritic, why in one specific case did she even sacrifice herself to protect someone else?But this does not mean that Eve hasn't her own faults.For one thing, although what she does is mostly out of pure virtue, she does not seem to care about what happens in any specific world line. This is imaginable, but if she has the ability to 'repair the damage' done by her in the end, WHY NOT EARLIER? I can't find a possible explanation.Also, Eve does not seem to fully realise that whenever she leaves a certain world where someone is deeply attached to her, she will hurt those who love her. It's not that she doesn't care about them in the book worlds though. My interpretation: Eve is one who brings love to others, but never gets seriously emotionally attached to anyone else. That is why:>>Human (mortal) love and divine love don't get to understand each other.For another, the ending. Oh crap. I'd rather let James Rolfe deal with this part. Simply put, Eve's choice is bad in all interpretations. I'm not going to list all the possible interpretations here (if you want to get spoiled, check the last part), but it appears that Eve only knows about love in a divine form and doesn't understand love in a human way: the bond between Hadzuki and Hatsumi is in a sisterly way, but not in ... OK, I'll stop here or there'll be very detailed spoilers.(A side note: There does exist one character in the anime who flirts constantly, to the extent of being increasingly annoying.)Now, more about the ending: It's not just simply anti-climatic.The ending has made the following achievements:>BS culmination of the major plotline>Screwing up the portrayal of 2 of the characters'(namely Eve & Lilith) characteristics, by treating a few scenes lightheartedly in the least appropriate circumstances possible!--OTHER CHARACTERS--Other characters may appear interesting, but most of them are simply not memorable.The exception being Lilith... whose character is even more screwed. Tell me, what impression have you left on her?There are hints that she is not as airheaded as she appears, but still she only leaves us an impression as a moe girl who only knows about flirting. The ending makes such impression even worse.To summarise what I've said:Story: 4/10  Starts out weak, gets quite good afterwards, and ends in an anti-climatic manner. And it's quite a mess and there are many things hard to understand.Characters: 5/10  Major characters are quite well-done, while a few side characters are either annoying or not memorable.Animation & Art: 8.5/10  Very good by 2003 standards. I don't really like Eve's appearance though. Also, one thing that bothers me is the extensive fanservice which I don't really enjoySound: 8/10  Good. I like the OP most, and have even made an 8-bit cover of it.Enjoyment value: 4.5/10  The extensive fanservice and the ending, enough said.Overall rating: 4.5/10 (Not an average) 'Mediocre' in my scales.But we're not done with the review. In fact we're yet to come to the core part.--WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS STORY?--The major part of the review, as via overinterpretation skills we can reach several unique conclusions, which, although don't add to the show's score, can be deep enough.Conflicts are the soul of drama. The ending of the show is indeed anti-climatic, but the conflicts which lead to the ending are unique:>What happens when divine love, human love, and the settings of the anime clash into each other?Answer: Divine love and human love can't understand each other, while in the end the settings of the anime win. Even Eve herself claims at several points in the anime, that Hadzuki and Hatsumi could not be with each other.This question seems confusing? Now, let's change one wording:>What happens when divine love, human love, and social norms clash into each other?Answer: The social norms win. (Or at least in this case, as in most cases.)I speculate that all the weird settings and the gainax ending are all meant to deliver the idea 'we can not be together!' which fits the social norms. This is how social norms screw an otherwise much better anime, in my opinion. (It's not that social norms are simply bad, but that older social norms demand every individual to fit their own 'category's' requirements)The fact is, YamiBou was made in 2003 and it was not until then did Japanese anime portraying lesbians become more open and less stereotyped. The portrayal in YamiBou is disappointing, but understandable though.Meanwhile, another question arose when I was watching Ep12 with the floating comments all going 'Damn you Eve! Now you know the consequences of seeking love interests everywhere?'So the other question:>What happens when love in a divine form enters the world of mortals?Answer: To be never understood by this world of sin!The in-universe answer to this question is how Gargantua becomes morbid. Eve knows how to love all creatures in a divine way, but humans don't, and some of them even consider love something that must be unilateral and possessive. This point has recently(2015) been criticised by a certain yuri anime.While among anime viewers: In this world full of harem anime, when anime characters show their kindness towards more than one people, such kindness would be interpreted as affection, and such affection as affairs, such affairs as sin. Natural deductions right? NOT!Even a certain character in Kin'iro Mosaic (an anime so fluffy and innocent) gets panned by some people in this way....So you've watched the anime and are confused about some certain parts (including the ending)?**DETAILED SPOILERS ALERT!****DETAILED SPOILERS ALERT!**Scroll downwards to see what I think about these parts...--What's the meaning of Hatsumi's letters to Hadzuki in Ep07?Some people think that these are indications that Hatsumi has affections towards Hadzuki. But I'm not in favour of this interpretation. Rather, in my opinion, these letters are written in a fictional person's perspective instead of in Hatsumi's perspective, and are meant to tell Hadzuki that (a lover's) love can not always be obtained even if you try hard.--Why is Eve's choice bad in all interpretations?Let's make some assumptions. Assume that...>Hadzuki's future baby would still vanish at the age of 16.Enough said. This is screwed in itself.>Hadzuki's future baby would not vanish at the age of 16.Why would Hatsumi vanish at the age of 16 then? Why couldn't Eve change history so that Hatsumi could be with her even after she turns 16? Seriously, I don't understand.And besides, there might be other alternative endings for the scriptwriters to choose from, for example Hadzuki staying with Eve in the library etc. Of all the endings they could choose from, the 'future baby' thing was chosen.(Stats: Suspicious Ups=0, Downs=0 as of 23 Apr 2015. Calculated with statistical hypothesis) Say, for fluffy slice-of-life shows, the main factor is enjoyment value, for example how good the jokes are and how heartwarming the show is.For romance stories, the main factors are the characters and how they undergo character development etc.For shows which try to deliver serious stuff, the main factors are the symbols, the points the anime delivers, and also the characters etc.But YamiBou is not any of them, and there is hardly a clear principle on which 'prime factors' to choose.

OK, I'll stop here or there'll be very detailed spoilers.(A side note: There does exist one character in the anime who flirts constantly, to the extent of being increasingly annoying.)Now, more about the ending: It's not just simply anti-climatic.The ending has made the following achievements:>BS culmination of the major plotline>Screwing up the portrayal of 2 of the characters'(namely Eve & Lilith) characteristics, by treating a few scenes lightheartedly in the least appropriate circumstances possible!--OTHER CHARACTERS--Other characters may appear interesting, but most of them are simply not memorable.The exception being Lilith... whose character is even more screwed. Tell me, what impression have you left on her?There are hints that she is not as airheaded as she appears, but still she only leaves us an impression as a moe girl who only knows about flirting. The ending makes such impression even worse.To summarise what I've said:Story: 4/10  Starts out weak, gets quite good afterwards, and ends in an anti-climatic manner. And it's quite a mess and there are many things hard to understand.Characters: 5/10  Major characters are quite well-done, while a few side characters are either annoying or not memorable.Animation & Art: 8.5/10  Very good by 2003 standards. I don't really like Eve's appearance though. Also, one thing that bothers me is the extensive fanservice which I don't really enjoySound: 8/10  Good. I like the OP most, and have even made an 8-bit cover of it.Enjoyment value: 4.5/10  The extensive fanservice and the ending, enough said.Overall rating: 4.5/10 (Not an average) 'Mediocre' in my scales.But we're not done with the review. In fact we're yet to come to the core part.--WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS STORY?--The major part of the review, as via overinterpretation skills we can reach several unique conclusions, which, although don't add to the show's score, can be deep enough.Conflicts are the soul of drama. The ending of the show is indeed anti-climatic, but the conflicts which lead to the ending are unique:>What happens when divine love, human love, and the settings of the anime clash into each other?Answer: Divine love and human love can't understand each other, while in the end the settings of the anime win. Even Eve herself claims at several points in the anime, that Hadzuki and Hatsumi could not be with each other.This question seems confusing? Now, let's change one wording:>What happens when divine love, human love, and social norms clash into each other?Answer: The social norms win. (Or at least in this case, as in most cases.)I speculate that all the weird settings and the gainax ending are all meant to deliver the idea 'we can not be together!' which fits the social norms. This is how social norms screw an otherwise much better anime, in my opinion. (It's not that social norms are simply bad, but that older social norms demand every individual to fit their own 'category's' requirements)The fact is, YamiBou was made in 2003 and it was not until then did Japanese anime portraying lesbians become more open and less stereotyped. The portrayal in YamiBou is disappointing, but understandable though.Meanwhile, another question arose when I was watching Ep12 with the floating comments all going 'Damn you Eve! Now you know the consequences of seeking love interests everywhere?'So the other question:>What happens when love in a divine form enters the world of mortals?Answer: To be never understood by this world of sin!The in-universe answer to this question is how Gargantua becomes morbid. Eve knows how to love all creatures in a divine way, but humans don't, and some of them even consider love something that must be unilateral and possessive. This point has recently(2015) been criticised by a certain yuri anime.While among anime viewers: In this world full of harem anime, when anime characters show their kindness towards more than one people, such kindness would be interpreted as affection, and such affection as affairs, such affairs as sin. Natural deductions right? NOT!Even a certain character in Kin'iro Mosaic (an anime so fluffy and innocent) gets panned by some people in this way....So you've watched the anime and are confused about some certain parts (including the ending)?**DETAILED SPOILERS ALERT!****DETAILED SPOILERS ALERT!**Scroll downwards to see what I think about these parts...--What's the meaning of Hatsumi's letters to Hadzuki in Ep07?Some people think that these are indications that Hatsumi has affections towards Hadzuki. But I'm not in favour of this interpretation. Rather, in my opinion, these letters are written in a fictional person's perspective instead of in Hatsumi's perspective, and are meant to tell Hadzuki that (a lover's) love can not always be obtained even if you try hard.--Why is Eve's choice bad in all interpretations?Let's make some assumptions. Assume that...>Hadzuki's future baby would still vanish at the age of 16.Enough said. This is screwed in itself.>Hadzuki's future baby would not vanish at the age of 16.Why would Hatsumi vanish at the age of 16 then? Why couldn't Eve change history so that Hatsumi could be with her even after she turns 16? Seriously, I don't understand.And besides, there might be other alternative endings for the scriptwriters to choose from, for example Hadzuki staying with Eve in the library etc. Of all the endings they could choose from, the 'future baby' thing was chosen.(Stats: Suspicious Ups=0, Downs=0 as of 23 Apr 2015.

Sankyuu! :)"", ""TL:DR If you like some funny action/serious drama along with cute characters and just a dash of lesbian tension to liven things up, you'll most likely enjoy this series.Going into watching this anime I had only read a simple synopsis. After watching the first episode I was concerned that my computer was skipping parts of the episode. The story jumped forward and backwards with little regard for the intervening time. For example between the ending of one episode to the next the main character learned how to use a sword... and acquired a sword in the first place. It's the little details like this that...are left out.Those plot holes aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the series, I felt like each character had their own motivations and could conceivably act the way that they did. The sound and artwork was great, although, I noticed, some images were reused in multiple scenes.All in all, I think that this series would have benefited from at least a couple more episodes to an entire season (of 13). I think this really would have let the creators explain away the holes. Also the ending. It was a powerful ending, but boy, did it leave me unfulfilled. If you felt like you needed more from the end of Blood+ then you might feel the same way here. are left out.Those plot holes aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the series, I felt like each character had their own motivations and could conceivably act the way that they did.

I find it very similar to Kannazuki no Miko, which automatically biases me but I\'ll try my hardest to write an non-judgemental review.Story:5Ok, I was kind of on the fence about the story. For a large portion of the anime I was thinking in my head ""WTH?"" I was also trying to desperately sort out who I should remember, who\'s names I should learn and what everyone\'s motivations were. Then I got to the final few episodes at which point I was actually starting to get it, and they really melted my heart. So, the beginning is kind...of meh, but the ending was really pretty good (and you finally started to get it) so I gave the mediocre score.Art:6This isn\'t my favorite art style. It\'s kind of washed out looking, and its too echhi for my tastes. I prefer anime with harder lines (its easier for me to draw afterwards haha). After a while you get used to the enormous heads and actually start to appreciate the characters\' looks. The animation was alright I suppose. Some of the fight things with the whole spinning skirt shot just made me laugh but the actual fighting part was pretty okay. Obviously that comes from the fact that the anime is based off of a game. All and all, the art is nice, just not my favorite.Sound: 7What bugs me is when people review sound when they haven\'t even taken time to listen to it outside of the anime. You can\'t really appreciate bits and pieces of it hacked together into certain scenes. I try to take the time to listen to the music from animes. I liked this anime\'s OST. It had some really nice orchestral and choral pieces and they\'re nice to listen to even on their own. I have a few personal favorites (mostly the ones that went with the dramatic romance-y scenes) but most of them are pretty nice and there\'s a good mix of tones and feelings. A well rounded soundtrack.Character: 7Not the best characters ever but pretty good.The three main characters were nicely designed and they actually had apparent motives (although Eve/Hatsumi\'s were a  little questionable). I found that I enjoyed the side characters which surprised me. I usually don\'t. (Ken-chan was super annoying and perverted, just sayin) Garuganchua, Ritsuko, and all of the other people from the other book worlds were pretty interesting, and really not too stereotypical. My personal favorite side characters were Youko and Meirin.Enjoyment: 8Yes, I did enjoy this anime after I got past the whole confusing part. Re-watching it several times has also been helpful, since now I actually understand the parts I didn\'t get the first time. It was a sweet story, although a little unsatisfying at the ending. It didn\'t even have a little easter egg type thing like KnM did.

The anime adaptation's H-game influence is apparent with many of the anime's female characters being well-endowed in breast size and some scenes are seemingly devoted to show off their assets with shower scenes, some suggestive predicaments, being in skimpy attire, or being in stages of undress. Some sexual humor and moments also comes into play at points with the library guardian, Lilith, lusting for Hatsuki at points and it is implied in a few scenes early in the series that Hatsuki is masturbating when thinking of Hatsumi. The majority of these scenes do detract from the story at points since they exist only to titillate the anime's audience.In regards to story development, it was mostly a mixed bag for me. Yamibo splits its time between Hatsuki venturing into more of the book worlds and more of Hatsumi's back story being fleshed out. I was mostly indifferent to the former's developments since Hatsuki is pretty shallow as a character since she is mostly defined by her brash disregard for anything not involving her love interest and while her venturing in the book worlds offer some intriguing adventures at points, the majority of them did little to catch my interest. Also, I was put off by many of the show's failed attempts at comedy offered since the jokes fell flat and there were several characters who seemingly existed as nothing more than comic relief.On the other hand, I did get some interest out of any time that the series devoted to exploring Hatsumi's character. She is shown to have a much larger influence in things affecting the Great Library than what it would seem on the surface through her venturing in the different book worlds and this serves to drive Gargantua's actions for much of the show's run.In regards to presentation, there is not much groundbreaking to it. While many of the character designs are made to be physically attractive and are nicely detailed, it skimps plenty of corners on animation as shortcuts like reused animation frames and still shot are a frequent occurrence in this series, especially during any action scenes with Hazuki.While having some effective storytelling involving Hatsumi, Yamibo is still mostly a rather forgettable anime title from the 2000s since a good chunk of its H-game and yuri roots can rear their ugly head at points to detract from the story and I was not too invested in Hazuki's part of the anime's story due to the limited depth she had as a character. There are better yuri and shoujo-ai titles to track down than this one. between Hatsuki and Hatsumi.

On Hatsumi\'s 16th birthday, she just disappears however Hazuki comes in contact with the residents of the Great Library, a baby talking chick and a girl by the name of Lilith voiced by Sanae Kobayashi, now Hazuki...quests through the books in order to find Hatsumi, but things aren\'t as easy as it seems.So some of the first things LA heard about this anime was that it was confusing and weird as fuck, well IT IS, no lie, with it\'s anachronic order of the plot, wacky batshit characters and not a care for cohesion, yeah LA can see why. Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito does have an underlying theme about love in ALL forms, with all the book worlds Hazuki goes through and with the main conflict concerning Hatsumi\'s disappearance towards Hazuki is and all and considering MOST of the characters in this anime are girls, yeah it\'s pretty much an anthology look at yuri because of it and LA didn\'t mind it really.What LA DID mind is just how erratic it\'s pacing is in how it was execute, like yes, the anime is followable once the anime ended and everything, but it\'s a morbidly weird experience just journeying through Hazuki\'s quest. How erratic is the pacing of the anime?, well for the MOST part, the plot follows an episodic format looking at certain worlds Hazuki and Lilith went into, but in others, it follows the ""villain"" Gargantua voiced by Shinichiro Miki and LA says villain very loosely of Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito and how he is linked with Hatsumi into everything. But the WORST case of erratic pacing LA found was in one episode, near the ending of one of the stories, they cut to the villain, then a certain backstory of him linking with Lilith that cuts INTO a flashback but into the backstory and ends in the backstory!On speaking of Gargantua, well even for an anime like this, his status as a villain is questionable as he gets ALOT of backstory to how he became who he is by the anime\'s start and he\'s done some despicable things in order to get Hatsumi, or immortality (long story) as his goal, but considering the major theme of Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito, his horrible deeds...goes unpunished when his revelations about himself are done and done and he\'s gone from the anime...like WHAT, that kinda irked LA.Hazuki is LA\'s favorite character by default, as she\'s something of the ace and a badass with a sword in the anime and her goal is at least something LA rooted for and at least got LA a bit interested in this crazy mind-bending anime and all throughout the anime her beliefs and goals are both shown and tested to the worlds she goes through making the obvious parallels to her crush on Hatsumi and everything, thematically, Hazuki is the most solid character out of the entire cast.Now if your thinking that the book worlds Hazuki and Lilith ventures into have ANY references to other literary work, they ""kinda"" do but it\'s not told forthright what it\'s referencing and how Hazuki and Lilith interacts with the book characters well it\'s kinda like the Kingdom Hearts effect where it\'s the basic summary of the book but still in line with it\'s plot by the end, though some of the later worlds gets trippy with Gargantua and Hazuki\'s backstory and development randomly slotted in whenever it wants, making it a meta-in-universe tangled web of plotlines.The animation done by Studio DEEN is actually decent albeit for expected early 2000\'s standards from them, the character designs are exotic and wacky (especially from Lilith), backgrounding was nothing to write home besides a few beautiful set pieces  but nonetheless and the fight scenes are the same as well. What the animation did well in at least was atmosphere with the gloomy atmosphere of the library to some of the more vibrant book worlds. Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito has TONS of fanservice and it\'ll show anyways it can as the anime really likes for characters to show off skin and the occasional talk of boob sizes and all, this doesn\'t deter LA\'s flaws to Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito as an anime , it\'s to be expected from an anime adapted from a yuri H-visual novel.Voice acting was ""ok"", best voice actor would go to Mamiko Noto, there were some squeakers in this anime, like Sanae Kobayashi as Lilith and Ai Shimizu as Hatsumi but nonetheless, the voice cast in this anime was just ""ok"", nothing but really to say other than that.As a confusingly, erratically paced yet episodic anime Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito was, Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito still did have something, sure it\'s blatant yuri but a yuri anime nonetheless layered with a main character LA did root for with a villain who really didn\'t do much but his actions being heinous and no retribution came about him in the end and the rest of the main and minor cast thematically evoking and helping Hazuki\'s quest for love by finding  her adoptive sister. Thematically it\'s solid, plot-wise, well good luck following the confusingly tangled Inception-like plot threads as Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito won\'t even hold your hand in this yuri rollercoaster. quests through the books in order to find Hatsumi, but things aren\'t as easy as it seems.So some of the first things LA heard about this anime was that it was confusing and weird as fuck, well IT IS, no lie, with it\'s anachronic order of the plot, wacky batshit characters and not a care for cohesion, yeah LA can see why.

But the WORST case of erratic pacing LA found was in one episode, near the ending of one of the stories, they cut to the villain, then a certain backstory of him linking with Lilith that cuts INTO a flashback but into the backstory and ends in the backstory!On speaking of Gargantua, well even for an anime like this, his status as a villain is questionable as he gets ALOT of backstory to how he became who he is by the anime\'s start and he\'s done some despicable things in order to get Hatsumi, or immortality (long story) as his goal, but considering the major theme of Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito, his horrible deeds...goes unpunished when his revelations about himself are done and done and he\'s gone from the anime...like WHAT, that kinda irked LA.Hazuki is LA\'s favorite character by default, as she\'s something of the ace and a badass with a sword in the anime and her goal is at least something LA rooted for and at least got LA a bit interested in this crazy mind-bending anime and all throughout the anime her beliefs and goals are both shown and tested to the worlds she goes through making the obvious parallels to her crush on Hatsumi and everything, thematically, Hazuki is the most solid character out of the entire cast.Now if your thinking that the book worlds Hazuki and Lilith ventures into have ANY references to other literary work, they ""kinda"" do but it\'s not told forthright what it\'s referencing and how Hazuki and Lilith interacts with the book characters well it\'s kinda like the Kingdom Hearts effect where it\'s the basic summary of the book but still in line with it\'s plot by the end, though some of the later worlds gets trippy with Gargantua and Hazuki\'s backstory and development randomly slotted in whenever it wants, making it a meta-in-universe tangled web of plotlines.The animation done by Studio DEEN is actually decent albeit for expected early 2000\'s standards from them, the character designs are exotic and wacky (especially from Lilith), backgrounding was nothing to write home besides a few beautiful set pieces  but nonetheless and the fight scenes are the same as well. What the animation did well in at least was atmosphere with the gloomy atmosphere of the library to some of the more vibrant book worlds. Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito has TONS of fanservice and it\'ll show anyways it can as the anime really likes for characters to show off skin and the occasional talk of boob sizes and all, this doesn\'t deter LA\'s flaws to Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito as an anime , it\'s to be expected from an anime adapted from a yuri H-visual novel.Voice acting was ""ok"", best voice actor would go to Mamiko Noto, there were some squeakers in this anime, like Sanae Kobayashi as Lilith and Ai Shimizu as Hatsumi but nonetheless, the voice cast in this anime was just ""ok"", nothing but really to say other than that.As a confusingly, erratically paced yet episodic anime Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito was, Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito still did have something, sure it\'s blatant yuri but a yuri anime nonetheless layered with a main character LA did root for with a villain who really didn\'t do much but his actions being heinous and no retribution came about him in the end and the rest of the main and minor cast thematically evoking and helping Hazuki\'s quest for love by finding  her adoptive sister. Thematically it\'s solid, plot-wise, well good luck following the confusingly tangled Inception-like plot threads as Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito won\'t even hold your hand in this yuri rollercoaster.', ""Note: the following comes from a video review, links on my profile page.One of the first noticeable things here is the quick change of genre; mostly taking a couple of episodes, they delve into entirely different worlds, kind of like Chrono Trigger, which then ended up resembling different styles.It starts off in a Baccano-esque train, which makes one think it's possibly a neo-noir, although even within this setting there are odd traits, like a traditional Japanese dress within a Siberian surrounding, and what seems like a stereotypical magic user (two sort of constants with variations throughout).While there is always an entirely different type of environment,...there are still similarities, besides the protagonists. What is interesting (that some people don't seem to appreciate or understand) is how the whole of this anime is like a combination of Inuyasha and Lain, with added innuendo. In thirteen episodes it certainly managed to include a variety of narratives and visual differences. It could have combined elements even more explicitly, but the subtle approach to it is interesting too.The point of this anime isn't the ecchi at all, no... how much hentai out there has the same average rating, though? For some people it seems having everything else also interesting makes no difference... To Love Ru is how popular, again? They have things in common; both attempt sci-fi, except in TLR it is almost deflated. Lala keeps inventing gizmos and the only thing the narrative comes up with is the same exact comedic routines invariably involving the protagonist falling, with inevitable coincidences. Lala in Yami happens to be an AI in a spaceship that cares for children for one particular reason... and yet the latter is what the average viewer rates less, really? Yami has so much depth to it, TLR tried to have bits of romance too, only to fall flat on its face (literally, often), whereas the romance in Yami can be funny and deep at the same time, with added existential complications.The ecchi, in a sense, is only there because there is also everything else along with it. Ecchi shouldn't be the point of an anime, just like the sports genre shouldn't ideally focus exclusively on that, and instead be merely an accompaniment along with characters' lives. If there is only ecchi, of course, it would practically be hentai, and that is what TLR very nearly is sometimes. Whereas with Yami, even in such scenes, the narrative is making itself cohesive, and not a moment is wasted on capricious nudity for its own sake.This is when a story is powerful - when, in a scene that could evoke merely lust, there is also a sense of inter-dimensional love, of a chance that something could be lost. Anime that would not settle with only a single relationship, but includes countless analogies of what that relationship could be, of what a cyclic universe could contain.

From the confusing but unique narrative, to the giant disturbing-looking hat, to the lesbian incest subplot, it's a real trip if you're only seeing it for the first time.In fact, I'm not sure how I was able to get through it. But that's for another time. Here are some of my honest thoughts on the bizzare, yet captivating world of Yamibo.First of all, a question on everyone's mind, what in god's good graces is going on here? Well to be frank, the plot is simple. Two sisters, Hatzuki and...Hatsumi live together. As an added bonus, Hatzuki has a giant prevalent crush on Hatsumi. Aside from that, on Hatsumi's 16th birthday she disappears out of nowhere. However, Hatzuki is able to follow her with the help of a creature named Ken, where they end up in a place called The Great Library.On a positive note, for an anime released in 2003 I was expecting much lower quality art and animation. As well as character design. Though, all of these things are the strongest point of the show. One of the reasons I was able to endure the absolutely deranged plot was because of how striking and unique the characters were.Now to the issue I have. The writing. This is where the show falls flat on its face. With such a unique storyline and characters, one would expect that the writing meets the same standards that I had walked in with. A lot of the characters, especially Hatsumi, have extremely boring and unlikable personalities and fall under severe cliches. Of course this is isekai, of course it's going to be cliche to all hell, but this is the kind that isn't handled properly.The only characters I can say that I enjoyed the presence of are Hatzuki, Kuiru, and Milka. Yet, that's already bad enough. Hatzuki is the main character with the most shown depth, however, a grand portion of that depth relies on the sister incest subplot that plays an unnecessarily large role in the series. Incest anime is one thing, for sure it exists and I acknowledge that it's just simply not my thing, and that's ok. I have an issue, though, with shows that just don't need it. Not even as a plot twist (I'm looking at you, Vampire Knight).Characters like Hatsumi are handled very poorly, she's written as a damsel-like, meekly, and almost fanservice-y character. Again, I have no issue with these sorts of things. In some shows, it's vital and I can see why it's utilized. Once again, the issue lies more with the fact that these tropes don't need to be utilized here. The series would've been much more entertaining if it weren't for the constant overuse of uninteresting narratives. Maybe the incest is interesting, I can't speak on that, but these things don't hold good reputation with my immersion in the series.In conclusion, and on a semi positive note, Yamibo wasn't horrible. In fact, I can say with my chest that I've seen worse. If you enjoy bizzare, short, and snappy shows with an almost indescribably awkward and strange nature to them, you'll love this. If you aren't a fan of those things, it still isn't a terrible watch for those into the early 2000s period of anime.My final ranking, I give it a 6/10. This was my first ever longform review so that's exciting. Hatsumi live together. As an added bonus, Hatzuki has a giant prevalent crush on Hatsumi.

I wish there was a section titled ""Lesbians & Bazongas"" for this is exactly what you\'ll encounter.This anime contains highly sexualized situations BUT it is by no means as brain dead, milquetoast or ""innocent"" as many more in the cauldron. It explores the concept of love in various forms and tastes, amidst magical and not creatures, while traversing worlds that are in fact written books in a grand library.Despite all the tropes and clichés contained, the anime gives a surprisingly decent, honest and mature insight in the various relationships encountered, along with assorted panty-shots...of course. I was not satisfied with the end and its core plot and the lack of exploration on the various technical details of the characters but it balances out with the amount and diversity of storylines it contains and its  characters. It had to end at around 13 episodes, after all...The animation is surprisingly good and nowhere near lazy ! Not once did I encounter a repeating scene or horrible frames. The voice acting is equally adequate, you can easily understand the emotions conveyed even if you miss words. The various visual and sound effects are decent too.Expect bazongas of various and sometimes ridiculous sizes from C and upwards, and high pitched voices, no matter the occasion. of course.

Snack Basue,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55636/Snack_Basue,"[""I never care to write reviews, but I can't believe that this show has zero reviews halfway through the cour and I mean to rectify that. The short of it is that Snack Basue is a unique gem which I strongly recommend people try the first few episodes of in spite of its low rating, especially if you're a fan of references, dialog-based comedy, and fourth-wall bulldozing.Describing Snack Basue is difficult; my first inclination is to compare it with similar shows, but shows similar to it are few and far between. Cromartie? Lucky Star? Bartender? It has bits and pieces of all of those, but...it still doesn't quite get what Snack Basue is. Personally I find myself comparing it to Trapeze if only because of how unique they both are. But even that doesn't quite grasp it.The first things everyone will notice are the character designs and animation. It's evocative of a mid-2000's Adult Swim original series or an old-school Flash animation, but there's more to it. The characters blink regularly, Akemi's hair moves fluidly, facial expressions are quite detailed, and background characters make small movements that other shows often leave out. While most of the time they're not moving at all, much of what is animated is done extremely smoothly. While the first impression is to call it flat and stilted, there's a real depth to what and when the studio chooses to animate.The show as a whole is structured as a collection of vignettes or shorts, around three to five per episode. There's some light continuity between them and characters will reference earlier shorts, but there isn't much any plot to speak of. Most of the shorts involve Akemi and one to three of the other core characters with distinct personalities. Occasionally there are additional one-off characters for only one or two shorts as well. Each episode ends with a character singing a karaoke song from the 70s or 80s.The real meat of the show is the references and the absurdist humor. Each episode is absolutely jammed packed with references to pop culture, music, television, and so forth. The sheer volume is comparable to shows such as Gintama, Hayate, or Nyaruko-san. Characters from other well-known media appear, it makes jokes about the voice actors and publishers, it even questions if overseas viewers will understand one of the references. It utterly knocks down the fourth-wall and dares it to stand up again. It's extremely dialog heavy, and the voice actors do a tremendously good job at carrying it.Of course, the jokes will not land for everyone, and some people will want a show that has things such as character development and a storyline. Such people should move on; Snack Basue is absolutely not a show for them, and it makes no pretensions to being such a show. However, for people looking for a show that doesn't take itself so seriously, a show that goes good with a drink on a Friday night, and a show with a special sort of charm and wit like fresh air in a musty room, Snack Basue is a real gem. it still doesn't quite get what Snack Basue is.

So what is snack bar? They are a part of Japan’s nightlife especially for the people who works ,there are similar to the bars but a lot of more cozy and has friendly atmosphere. In this bar the bartenders called ‘mama’ and they became someone who listen and talk with you. You can socialize with other guest and have a good evening.Snack Basue has two hostess, oldest hostess Basue (the bar belongs to her) and younger hostess Akemi. We see a daily life conversation between Akemi her mother and guests who...came to Snack Bar. All the guest we gonna see here gonna be man which I think pretty close to reality. Conversations that we here a generally about the characters personality, situation that happens to them and different views on a random themes . Sometime we see talks about sexual concepts which I think done very nicely. Other than this there are episodes that has more of reference to anime and other pop culture situations where we can see different characters from different anime or real life.One of the best part that this show done correctly is the characters they all feel real. Which is very important for an anime that is about people. As characters we have 4 main guest that we see the most they are Yamada , Tatsu, Kazama and Morita all four man has different personalities and lifestyles and I think even if you don’t love their personalities you not gonna hate them you’re not gonna feel like you don’t wanna them on the screen. Akemi is our main host and kind of main character of the anime a young woman who has her own relationship problem but can find a way to talk with any kind of human. Very enjoyable main character. The supporting cast that we see through the anime has great moments too.This anime don’t have a plot it’s an episodic anime in one episode we mostly see 2 different situation that happened in Bar in different times.Other than that The humor done nicely. The jokes are different from each other and references helps them to be better if you love more of talking humor you gonna enjoy it but if you are more of action oriented humor you maybe wanna skip it.A thing I notice in myself while watching this anime is that I myself start to think about the answer of conversation or what I think about this topic which for me was a great.About animation I wanna say it works for it anime it’s very different and not for everyone but it definitely works. The musics are great every episode ends with and karaoke and the Op is done greatly.In the end if you wanna watch an romcom type of comedy on a theme that never done before in anime should definitely watch it. Its different, it’s new and done correctly.

Shows like last season\'s Megumi no Daigo a.k.a Firefighter Daigo showcasing how firefighting is done in Japan, those shows when marketed to the West, can look very niche and is rather hard to market overseas. And when it does, it only gets a lukewarm reception and nothing more. Sadly, this is...the case for yet another underwatched show this season: mangaka Forbidden Shibukawa\'s Snack Basue.When you first watch this show and think to yourself that this show is kinda all over the place, boring and whatnot, I clearly understand that the show is catered not for the Average Joe. But for those who are genuinely interested in this show, read on.It\'s clear that Snack Basue is meant to be a parody of a culture that you can ONLY experience in Japan: Nomikai, or as commonly referred to as the drinking culture. This is one of many parts of Japan\'s sacred cultures, which is how Japanese people bond over nomikai as part of the work experience on the social front, that\'s usually expected on participation, although it is not expressly required.And that\'s exactly the premise of Snack Basue as a whole: with hostesses of Akemi and Mama Basue, customers from regulars to newcomers will frequent the place, bringing up whatever topics they like to wish to rant and/or discuss it out, and then at the end of the way, sing a karaoke song of the country\'s late 1970s to early 1990s Reconnaissance period of music. It\'s truly Japan when it comes to things like this. The various customers of salaryman Yamada, delinquent/gangster Brother Tatsu, pervertic afro-haired middle-aged man Morita, the married Kazama, boss-like man Miki Azuma, hippie man Kawa, even the parodies of Yuusha (from Dragon Quest) and Jersey Man (which by its VA you should recognize the parody), they all form part of the trope that is Snack Basue, dilly-dally-ing their way through the night, talking about the most random of topics in quick successions of wit, with comedy so out-of-place on the global POV that only native Japanese people can relate to. It can be absurdly funny sometimes when its humour even breaks the 4th wall (like Gintama), from popular characters to even publishers, nothing is off the hook when it comes to comedic criticism.Clearly, its production feels stinted, but that\'s part of the charm of the show as well. Produced by Studio PuYUKAI who did the Isekai Quartet series, it certainly has a chibi charm to it that adds an element to the overall show\'s feel. Also, Rie Takahashi being Akemi just adds fuel to the overall humour of the show, and it\'s obscenely clear that her character just doesn\'t take anything seriously at all, going along with the banters of her customers, both regular and new. Also, the OP song for this is a LEGIT banger, being a ""left, right, center"" of unhinged hype entertainment for comedy values.Snack Basue is a show not for the Average Joe, that\'s pretty much a given. If you want to have a night\'s rest not thinking about the world and drowning yourself in some deranged comedy while siping some alcohol, Snack Basue would serve you well with its free-spirited wording and easy viewership, even if you don\'t understand most of its heavy dialogue, which even then, it doesn\'t expect you to understand much of it anyways (as a low-key jab at foreigners not understanding any context). the case for yet another underwatched show this season: mangaka Forbidden Shibukawa\'s Snack Basue.When you first watch this show and think to yourself that this show is kinda all over the place, boring and whatnot, I clearly understand that the show is catered not for the Average Joe.

And BAM, one episode in, I\'m convinced it\'s the season\'s hidden gem. The humour? Off the charts. It\'s got this Gintama vibe but, dare I say, it\'s even better.The whole show\'s just taking hilarious jabs at loser guys, and Morita? Absolute comedy gold. 😂 Every single episode\'s got me grinning from ear to ear. I\'m all in, week after week.It\'s just so funny. There\'s this genuine charm to...it that I can\'t get enough of. it that I can\'t get enough of.', ""Snack Basue is entirely carried by the episodic dialogues that occur in Snack Basu, a Snack Bar in the outskirts of a random, unnamed city. Akemi and Basue are the proprietors of the place, and it's through their random interactions with customers that drive the entire show.To put it bluntly, I think that the show would have functioned better as a podcast or drama CD. The effects of the visuals are close to none. Facial expressions are stiff, people are always standing still, and the overall animation style reeks of low budget adult swim shows that never got approved for any more. The visual medium...is not utilized a single bit, and imagining the scenes out as a radio show might have been the way to go.You might be wondering whether or not the humor is fit for you. My favorite type of shows are gag to begin with, so the fact that they were still so dry and boring to me speaks volumes. It's not exactly over-the-top, but it's definitely not going for a realistic take either on the interactions that take place. It's sort of a middle ground where you can sort of imagine these conversations being somewhat real with a comedic embellishment, but that doesn't really make it that much more interesting or boring. None of the characters really stand out and the episodic nature of the show means that these short form episodes really need to stand out, which they don't. If you don't like the first 12 or so minutes of the first episode, you can basically drop the show. It's not going to get any better or worse going forward. is not utilized a single bit, and imagining the scenes out as a radio show might have been the way to go.You might be wondering whether or not the humor is fit for you.

Street Fighter Zero The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/979/Street_Fighter_Zero_The_Animation,"['""Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation"" came a lot later than ""Street Fighter II: The Movie"", and it\'s not a patch on it. (Just to confirm: I\'m talking about the animated movie, not that goddam awful live action one starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue...) The visuals aren\'t as good, nor is the production, nor anything else for that matter. The action is not that great - half the time it\'s hard to tell what\'s going on, and the other half of the time they\'re charging up fireballs. In fact they spend so much time charging up fireballs that that the anime feels hollow and...seriously lacking in substance. There is one thing that\'s good about the fighting though - the bone crunching blows has a sickening, brutal quality to it when they land, helped along by a dark and twisted atmosphere that\'s prevalent within the anime. In fact that heavy atmosphere is probably the one thing about the movie that stood out for me.Content wise, Ryu\'s struggle with the dark hadou is mildly interesting, as is his brother appearing. These concepts might have been put to better use if the anime wasn\'t too busy dragging its feet and doing, well, doing nothing really. When the characters aren\'t wasting time charging fireballs, the anime generally takes on an air of contemplation. But what are they contemplating? Well, turns out this is yet another one of those crappy fighting anime which spend the length of the show asking that ""all important question"": why do we fight. By the end of it, they come to the laughable conclusion: to find the answer!!! Or something stupid along those lines. Wow that was worth the wait. Such talent is surely wasted in street fighting - these guys should have become philosophers instead!Ultimately, ""Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation"" feels sluggish and forgettable. Though it\'s not quite as worthless as some of the other fighting game to anime conversions floating about (""Fatal Fury"" and especially ""Tekken"" jumps to mind), it\'s quite a way away from hitting the standards set by ""Street Fighter II: The Movie"" (the animated one, not that goddam awful live action one staring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue). seriously lacking in substance.

So before I watched this I had high hopes, just thinking about what a Hadōken would look like in an anime format was a fabulous thought. Unfortunately this isn\'t the awesome SF film i expected. It feels like it made was for fans so it misses the mark in terms of capitalizing on the game material they have to work with, but overall the film is a good watch if not a very interesting one.The story is pretty...straightforward and easy to understand, Ryu is trying to overcome the evil force inside of him that consumed Akuma (the brother of his sensei) and this force is known as the ""Dark Hadou"". While Ryu tries to deal with these problems that are affecting his life, another unexpected aspect comes into play in the shape of a boy called Shun who claims to be Ryu’s brother. Ken happens to catch up with Ryu joins him on his journey to help overcome is powers, Chun-Li happens to be sorting through a police investigation that happens to tie into a fighting competition and Sakura after chasing after Ryu after seeing him fight for the first time comes into play and all of them happened to become interlocked by the fighting tournament with their own reasons for entering.It is a story that holds up well enough for it to be considered true Street Fighter canon material with most of the characters involved feeling right, Ryu is still a lone warrior with great fighting skill, Ken is Ryu’s friend and training partner who fights in numerous tournaments, Chun-Li is also fighter, working with the police with a smart and calm attitude and Sakura is an energetic young fighter with unpolished skills who idolizes Ryu. Enemies like Gouki (Akuma), Dan, Zangief and Vega do what they do with creditable performances,  however the main antagonist really didn’t do it for me, he just seemed like a power-hungry fool who got his fifteen minutes of fame and then was dispatched with. I feel they should have gotten a more interesting villain as this guy didn’t have the proper personality to properly be an antagonist worthy of the SF series. Also the fact that Ryu had a brother is just nonsense to me and it breaks the image of Ryu as a lone wolf searching for answers to his powers which he may never know of.When it come to the art and animation we see that the film is very stylized for better or for worse depending on your preferences, some characters and signature attacks look good while others look like they could have been better. The art style for the characters looks good works well, but a fair amount of the characters look too musclar and bulky and the art also makes certain people look beefier and heavier in movement then they are in the actual games. There is also the point of the energy-based attacks that didn’t look as impressive as they could have with most of them being ball-shaped with no defining features and being one main colour which really disappointed me. But then maybe that’s just me being picky.Now I know that in an adaptation of anything nothing is going to fully be spot on, but with an anime film you have the chance to show off things that games can’t do, you have to wow the viewer. The film felt like it was almost there but could of had more style, there are some pretty good fight scenes and some painful blows dealt to characters that shows that there was care put into the film, but at other points the film forgets choreography and battle sequences, the game material and gives you something that could have looked a lot better. When it comes to audio it’s pretty good, the soundtrack is nice and the having watched it in subbed and dubbed formats I’d say they both work.I conclusion this is a film that was created truly for Street Fighter fans, it’s based off of the games and for what it’s worth it does what it can fairly well, but unfortunately it comes up short in not delivering the full anime experience  it deserves. Style and art design play a big part in carrying the film along and it is worth a watch whether you’re a fan of the Street Fighter series or if you are person who likes action, fighting and story that works and is rather enjoyable. straightforward and easy to understand, Ryu is trying to overcome the evil force inside of him that consumed Akuma (the brother of his sensei) and this force is known as the ""Dark Hadou"".

It was a film I was pretty positive towards and with good reason. It had some solid action sequences, a compelling plot and was pretty close to everything that the game's fans wanted. This film comes from the same studio six years later in 2000. It's not connected to the first, but they surely must have had time to iron out those elements that didn't work and make something improved, right?Like last time, I'll be using the Japanese character names.Story:We open with Ryu contemplating on his...old master while also struggling with some strange energy. This is the dark hadou, a power force that corrupted Gouki and may very well do the same to Ryu if he lets it overtake him. Meanwhile, Chun-Li is trying to track down a Doctor Sadler who's reportedly working for Shadaloo, Sakura is trying to find the mysterious martial artist (Ryu) she saw beat up a bunch of thugs alongside Chun-Li & a boy, Shun, claims to be Ryu's brother and starts living alongside Ryu & Ken at the dojo.There are a lot of issues with this film. The first is the whole struggle Ryu has with the dark hadou. The film portrays this as an inner struggle that could lead Ryu down a path where he cares about nothing but fighting but we see no real evidence that that's the outcome. We never see Ryu get into a fight for no real reason, he always fights to protect someone else or because he thinks he's in danger and has no trouble turning down fights. The same is rue with Gouki, the man who was “consumed” by the dark hadou. Ryu and Chun-Li go to his island to talk with him and he just lets them go after a short, vague chat. And the whole big thing about it kind of ends in an anti-climax. Then we have the stuff with Sadler. It's largely boring. Sakura spends the film trying to meet with Ryu but she never speaks with him. Instead, the pay off to her whole arc is a short lecture from Ken. And the whole thing is completely irrelevant to the main narrative. Then there's the stuff with Shun. Which is probably the worst part of the film. Not only is this kid an annoyance but the latter part of the film has a lot of tension that relies on us caring about this kid and what befalls him. All while not giving us any compelling reason to care.I guess you can give the film some credit  for tying most of its narrative threads together but it kind of doesn't work when you have no reason to care about any of them.Characters:While the other film gave us a good sense of character for the major characters, at least, this one gives us kind of dull, generic focus characters. And if you thought this being based off of Street Fighter Alpha specifically was going to affect which characters get major roles, you'd be mistaken. The two Alpha characters we see the most of are Rose & Sakura. Neither of whom really gets to fight. Sakura spends her time in the pointless side story of trying to find Ryu. Rose spends her time appearing to Ryu as a sort of mystical guide. We see some other Alpha characters like Birdie, Dan, Guy, Adon, & Sodom, for very brief parts that give them virtually no sense of personality. Our main antagonist isn't even an actual Street Fighter character. He's a completely original non-character. Shun is the worst, though. He's obnoxious and the attempts to make him sympathetic are completely cliché.Art:If there's one thing you'd expect from a film based off of Street Fighter, it's probably strong action. Which is not something this film possesses. You know how those long running mindless action anime frequently involve lazy action sequences that feature characters stopping to charge their special attacks while their opponent sits back and lets them, side characters getting taken out easily and then the protagonist jumping in and ending the whole skirmish disgustingly easily? That's the major action sequences in this film in a nutshell. The more minor ones just show our major characters fighting nameless henchmen or they're ten second snippets of the Street Fighter cast fighting on an island. I guess you can give the film some credit in that its character designs do mimic the Alpha art style pretty faithfully but this is the type of franchise that's known for its action and those sequences are pretty lousy.Sound:They did get some capable actors for this. Including Orikasa Ai, Touma Yumi  & Nishimura Tomomichi. Their performances in this, however, aren't very good. They're okay, especially considering what they had to work with. The music by Matsuo Hayato is really forgettable.Ho-yay:This film doesn't develop its characters or their relationships enough for any of them to seem romantic.Final Thoughts:Alpha is a lousy film. The disparate narrative threads are pretty bad and they don't form a stronger whole. The characters range from obnoxious brat Shun to bland major character. The action sequences are weak. All in all, it's barely better than what Hollywood did with the franchise. My final rating is going to be a 3/10.

The film features most of the cast from the game, and even squeezes in at least four characters from the video game sequel. The film is rumored to be the sequel to the Street Fighter V series. In all honesty, I do not see the connection any where. There is just no possible way this could be the sequel or prequel to anything. If for some strange reason it is, then it creates nothing but continuity issues. I simply look at this movie as a stand alone and nothing more. Casual...fans can come into this and quickly understand what\'s going on. However, this movie was clearly meant for the fans of the video game, and even a majority of them has trashed this one over the years.The Street Fighter franchise has went down hill since the original animated movie. Now make no mistake, the original was no work of art, and I would never consider it to be very good anime or god forbid great anime; but at least there was one area where it shined, and it happened to be in the fights. That film contained the best action scenes in the Street Fighter animated franchise. Unfortunately, the action scenes are only one of the many issues with this film, as they don\'t even begin to compare with the weakest scenes from the original film.The action scenes can be halfway decent when they want to, but too many fights consist of either unseen action or two seconds of displaying a move. The fight scenes never exercise the animation to its full ability, which results in nothing more than just mediocre action meant to kill time. I wasn\'t the least bit impressed or entertained at all during this movie. There are small occasions when the animation is pretty fluid delivering decent choreography. However, these scenes are few and far between. The artwork is very passable, and the characters perfectly resemble their video game counter parts.The plot has a few decent moments that will mainly mean something only to fans who have followed the game. It revolves around the mystery of the ""Dark Hado"", and pushes a possible confrontation between Ryu and Akuma. The movie contains the usual, and most obvious martial art theme, which is one seeking to become stronger, but I found the drama to be completely non engaging because I found the characters to be boring.Now speaking of the characters, most of the beginning spends time building the relationship between Ryu and Shun. This happens to be the hardest part of the movie to get through. Shun is a detestable character in everything that he does, and his repetitive dialogue grows annoying very quick. I really hated Shun, and not too many people were fond of him from what I remember.The biggest problem that I\'ve known fans to have with this anime happens to be the lead villain. The main characters: Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li battle against a man who does not appear in the game. Although I can forgive if a video game to anime ignores the source material. The villain should at least be interesting. The villain by the name of Dr. Sadler comes off as just another stock bad guy who wants to rule the world, and is unconvincing at trying to obtain his goal. Been there, done that.Street Fighter Alpha isn\'t the worst video game to film that I\'ve seen. It\'s not even close actually, but it\'s nowhere near a good anime, and I highly recommend skipping it if you\'re not a fan of the franchise. If you are a fan, then I recommend setting your expectations very low.High: Decent artwork and animationLows: Boring plot, boring fights, insipid villain, just plain boring fans can come into this and quickly understand what\'s going on.

Have you even SEEN this thing?  It's f'ing terrible.  Ryu looks like The Hulk wearing a headband.  It's embarrassing!They hype up a battle that never happens (Akuma) and there aren't even some of the most well-liked characters from the game in the movie at all.  It's like a shitty version of Dragon Ball Z.The main focus is Chun Li's crotch.   This should have been an OVA in the series, not a feature length film.  Those 90 minutes totally overstayed their welcome (refer again to the Chun Li comment).It's poor.  The only thing that...gives it any credit is the title and the art, for its time.

One complaint is that they have way too many characters from the games not doing anything. Sagot is in the background of, what, one scene? ', 'I only know about Street Fighter in passing, fighting games really aren\'t my thing. I went into this thinking I would know at least a handful of the characters but I always remembered it being a grounded compared to other fighting games like Tekken with its random God-seed/Demon-seed thing it did. It got to the point where characters were constantly talking about dark chi and becoming Super Saiyans that I realised I was wrong.If you aren\'t a fan of the game, I think you\'ll find this pretty impenetrable as a movie even ignoring everyone suddenly having magical powers. Characters are mentioned with such weight and...become important figures in the story, but might only get a minute or two of screentime. If you know the character from the game, it will probably make sense but if you don\'t, you\'ll probably be confused why Chun-Li is so stunned about ""Dr Sadler"", especially at the end where his tiny amount of screentime is.Ryuu as a character was just pretty bland, same for Chun-Li whose motivation is to find her dad which she mentions twice but when they get to their destination, she never even looks for him. Ken had a little more personality than the two of them but it wasn\'t anything major. Sakura had the most character and personality out of the cast but she plays such a tiny role in the movie because for some reason they decided we needed a young boy called Shun to show up to be the emotional core of the movie and kind of a character surrogate, but it was a strange choice when Sakura already seemed to be filling that role as a newbie fangirl in the world of street fighting. It doesn\'t help that Shun is just kind of an annoying character.Other characters just pop up and disappear as just blatant cameos that have very little baring on the plot. Akuma is probably the most glaring one, appearing in a vision once or twice before Ryuu decides to visit him to have a talk about the dark powers but by this point we\'re already well aware of them so it seems pointless, especially since Akuma just kind of walks off after a minute on screen.The fights are generally well animated though but some of them stretch on too long, the end fight being a pretty blatant example. I don\'t know how many times characters got their second wind against a basically immortal enemy. Character X will sacrifice themselves to Character Y can escape, but Character X will run back to save Y and tell them to run, who will then run back to save X and tell THEM to run. It\'s a bit much. The fights against the impossibly weak enemies are considerably more fun compared to the big, weighty fights the movie really throws its attention at.The first 10 minutes move at a breakneck speed as they try to introduce all of the characters and their motivations. Then it really slows down as we get repeated discussions of the dark powers and Ryuu\'s fear of falling to them for a long stretch in the middle, then they rush to the final encounter, infiltrate the base within 2 minutes and then the final fight takes up the last 20 or so minutes of the movie.The most glaringly strange thing was the ""Rose"" character. A magical lady who just kind of appears 2-3 times throughout the movie to give advice to Ryuu and then disappear again. There is no explanation of her whatsoever. She\'s introduced like a villainous character but apparently was a good guy. Her presence was so unimportant that I kept forgetting she existed but everytime she popped up I had to relive that moment again of ""Oh, there\'s a weird looking magical woman talking to Ryuu in his dreams about the Tarot cards. Cool.""Overall, pretty disappointing but I\'m sure if you\'re a fan of the franchise you\'ll get more out of it than me. If they\'d removed the Shun character entirely and kept a more grounded story, I\'d have enjoyed it a lot more but the repetitive ""Will he fall to the dark power"" storyline that dominated from about the 15 minute mark onwards really bored me to tears because you can guess the answer without even watching the movie. become important figures in the story, but might only get a minute or two of screentime. If you know the character from the game, it will probably make sense but if you don\'t, you\'ll probably be confused why Chun-Li is so stunned about ""Dr Sadler"", especially at the end where his tiny amount of screentime is.Ryuu as a character was just pretty bland, same for Chun-Li whose motivation is to find her dad which she mentions twice but when they get to their destination, she never even looks for him.

This darkness inside of him, manifests as the Dark Hadoken, which is used at the very end of the Film against a strong opponent that was created to harness all the fighting styles of each character. Behind him, in the shadows, is a mad-man  scientist-like-guy, who collects the data...(or power) with each attack that the fighters (Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li) unleash against it. Fortunately, but also unfortunately, the only move that it does not know, and the only way to destroy it, is to unleash a full-throttle Dark Hadoken, which Ryu eventually does, to win the fight, and to also free his little brother from that bloody things hold over him.Outside of that is a young school-girl by the name of Sakura, who witnesses Ryu in fighting action (this is earlier on in the anime) and sets out on a personal journey of her own to become like him (to be strong enough to fight him one day) She is a character in the SF Universe that symbolizes the early developmental stages of an aspired martial arts master. She has a lot of heart, and spunk, but also has a lot of maturing to do. As a personal note, I tend to veer toward these types of characters in anime/video games, because I see myself as a lot like them in my own life.For Rating of this anime, I gave the Story/Plot an 8, because the Story did keep me captivated throughout the entire film. The Animation got a 7, because although it was good, it was quite outdated. Characters got a 8 because they are indeed Iconic Characters from a very popular Video Game franchise, but are also slightly outdated character designs, overall got a 7 mostly because of how dated the film was. Enjoyment however got an 8, mostly because I like the Characters and the Story was captivating enough to hold my attention the entire way through.

Tenchi Muyou! Ryououki 5th Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40097/Tenchi_Muyou_Ryououki_5th_Season,"['I just don\'t know why I persist after the first set of the Ryo-Ohki OVAs followed by the Universe TV series and movies which were pretty great. Everything since from all the alternate takes / reboots to the various spin-offs have ranged from barely relevant to outright bad. Isekai Monogatari & Tenchi GXP are not terrible per se but they were at best tangentially related to Tenchi. However they felt a need to tie it all together into one giant lore that presumably aims to be dense and rich but ends up incomprehensible and ridiculous. Just about every character that has ever showed up in...any capacity in any ""related"" series puts in an appearance here either as glorified extras or extended cameos.  At least I think so since I could not recognize or remember more than half of them nor can I remember them now after watching them. The titular hero himself is now a tertiary player in his own series and what should have been the defining development that original fans have been craving for comes off as just another event in a slideshow of events. It just suddenly shows up, happens and then just as quickly  fades into the background. Detailing the event should be a spoiler but the show manages to spoil it just fine by itself.The art is jus plain ugly and calling the animation limited would be charitable. The bottom of the character design barrel has been well and truly scraped with true abominations making the cut. I have nothing to say about the music because I cannot recall a single note of it.I must admit that Tenchi Muyo was a formative element in my anime fandom so to see it fall so far and so hard is genuinely distressing. Scenes that should be invoking nostalgia and warmth only stir up regret and sadness. Hopefully this is truly the end. any capacity in any ""related"" series puts in an appearance here either as glorified extras or extended cameos.

I always wanted a new Geminar season so this was nice to get. I'm still hoping though.All of the favorites are here, plus more. It was nice to see all the oldies again and especially the spinoff characters here.Why is MAL causing me to write such a long review?

If thats the case, its just a terrible show.

MOSTLY! i won't spoil so watch and figure out which is all original and which actually blends into the 'canon storylines'. i'm NOT saying the movies SUCK! i'm saying the Movies are worthless in that they don't tell the Main Storyline of the franchise properly. #3 THE SOURCE(s) have NOT been officially English translated to date! don't rely on fanslations, they're sketchy at best.///as to 'TMRO' Season 4 and now Season 5 yes, they're not looking EXACTLY like the oldest and kinda older Tenchi shows/movies. the baseline design changes are minimal at best for characters. only 1 or 2 were entirely revamped. if you watch 'GXP' or 'War On Geminar' before 'TMRO' S4,5 you'll see a few characters with all new looks and some characters never before seen in any Tenchi show. you know why?.... spoiler-ish here... there's a 'GXP' Story Arc that happens immediately AFTER!!! 'GXP' final episode's Wedding Ceremony that lasts quite a while in the sources. yeah i can't read em, but i've got internet buddies in Japan who've read em and told me as such. this 'GXP' story arc finishes in-and around 'TMRO' S4 when Kenshi is born until around where he's 5y/o. my sources were kinda sorta iffy on this 'GXP' storyline's ending since 'TMRO' S4 hadn't even been in pre-pre production yet when i asked around amongst my Japanese acquaintances.....as to story? hell yeah it's damn complex! the original OVAs were done in the 1990's! dang. name me an anime that damn old that's STILL producing episodes today? Dragonball's the only show i know of with that long of a production length. plus there's THREE Main Characters with their own separate but intertwining stories, Kenshi, Tenchi, and Seina. so 'TMRO' S4,5 have sketchy stories? no, not really. there's just TOO MUCH backstory behind all these characters and there's SO MANY characters included in S4 and S5. there's some space fights, some training arcs... heck many of the episodes' meat is ALL training. there's a reason for all these peculiar stories, that's my next paragraph.///do we finally learn how 'serious' Tenchi gets with his harem? do we finally learn how serious Kenshi gets with his harem? do we learn just WHY Kenshi's like he is during 'War On Geminar'? yup, we sure do. go watch 'TMRO' S4,5 and learn. is EVERYTHING about Tenchi? NO! is EVERYTHING about Seina? NO! in my opinion? 'TMRO' S4,5 do three main things with the franchise story:1. retell the wedding of Rea and Nobuyuki that was just barely animated previously.2. cross-link all the Tenchi and Seina storylines with BACKSTORIES and move those two guys and their harem's storylines forwards.3. and most important i think after watching 'TMRO' S4,5... give us Kenshi's life from his parents getting married till he arrives on Geminar.///art? snort. it's very good! well above average for any TV series out there. these are OVAs folks, they come to us spread out over months and years. plus remember 2020? covid lockdowns all over the world? don't ever forget that pretty much halted ALL anime production in Japan lots of times for lots of projects.///sound? as best as i can tell every old OVA and TV series character's got the same Voice Talent. the OP/EP songs are great, the theme pieces in the bodies of the eps are great, the foley and sound effects are great.///character, as i've said... there's a buttload of them! some of them don't get diddly for backstory! as i said before there's a whole 'GXP/Seina/his harem' story arc left out of ALL the anime to date. there's characters on screen who've got lines, actions, interactions with little to nothing known about them other than a name. sure this sucks... but without putting dozens of minutes aside for randomly inserted expositions and flashbacks and whatnot the ENTIRE cast just can't be backfilled into two season's worth of OVAs. but the classic Tenchi and Seina characters are alive and well and as fun as ever! and and AND we see maturity amongst the classic rivals inside the harems! it's not all catfights and insults flying and fist-fights and supernatural etc. duels destroying everything around them. plus the girls all grow up and look great! ;) the lil ones get va va voom! and the peculiar ones get ooh la la! and there's mmm ehhh... 15ish years of timeline moving along in 'TMRO' S4,5.///enjoyment, hmm... binge the entire franchise EXCEPT 'War On Geminar' BEFORE watching 'TMRO' S4,5... after the final episode of S5 watch 'Geminar' THEN! i watched the entire franchise before watching a single episode of 'TMRO' S4 and loved it. it had been only the third time i'd watched the entire Tenchi franchise in one go-through in 31 years.//overall? whew! S4,5 filled in HUGE GAPS i didn't even know existed from the end of the previous OVAs and Geminar and TV series. i can't say S4,5 are the BEST parts of the franchise. but they're still GREAT shows.///i hope you enjoyed my review and learned a great deal of things. :D i'm old enough to have rented and seen ROBOTECH's dub on VHS in 1990 from Harmony Gold not even six months after the first tapes were sold in the USA. so the first dubbed Tenchi OVAs were on DVD for more than a year before i could find them for sale. but i got them and the Evangelion DVDs as fast as my allowance could buy them.///this review's gonna be a BIT spoiler filled! i'll try and generalize as MUCH as possible! plus it'll be tl;dr but tough. read through it. you might learn something.////overall for the Tenchi franchise ... what can i say that hasn't been said about previous iterations seasons OVAs movies in the franchise? the TIMELINES/PLOTLINES SUCKS! heh. #1 thing anybody just getting into the Tenchi franchise should know is that. #2 THE MOVIES DON'T COUNT! heh. yeah. they're almost ALMOST all worthless one-off anime-only original movies.

(Note: The first episode of the Japanese version contains minor nudity (Adam and Eve) which was edited in the English dubbed version.)Story: 10/10As there were many theological advisors, Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant alike, who assisted both directors, the stories were impeccably told.Art: 6/10Not great,...but not bad, just adequate for the production.Sound: 6/10I would have wished that the soundtrack was more orchestral rather than the slightly tinny 90's soft Jpop which served as the anime OP and ED.Character: 10/10Perfect!! Gave the figures realism but not enough to go over the heads of kids. I very much appreciated that they were not treated as fictional characters but as real people who really lived.Enjoyment: 9/10As I said before, this anime really helped teach me the Bible as a kid and guided my growth as a Catholic Christian, so my enjoyment of it is more sentimental and thankful.Overall: 9/10Good, wholesome anime for kids and great memories for me!!Thanks for reading and God Bless! :) but not bad, just adequate for the production.Sound: 6/10I would have wished that the soundtrack was more orchestral rather than the slightly tinny 90's soft Jpop which served as the anime OP and ED.Character: 10/10Perfect!!

I would like to state that this is so good that both me and a friend (my friend having watched only one episode) decide to buy the cd online. YouTube only has episodes 1 - 21 and 25. This covers only the old testaments. It wouldn't be a understatement to say this has brought me closer to God.

While reading the bible is amazing, seeing it makes it feel real....Perfect for binge watching.Story: 9There was a few things left out and put in that made me shake my head. This was mainly the Josheph arc. I would of also liked to see more of the noah's arc story. Most of the time what happenned inside the arc during the 40 days is left out.

They offer a (very!) brief look into the girls' daily lives.The episodes themselves are hit and miss; some of them are funny, or at least interesting, while others feel pointless. Everything looks and sounds consistent with the show, but the animation is limited a lot of the time, and some episodes don't even bother to show anyone. One positive is that we get to see more of a character who's introduced very late in the series, but unfortunately we still don't get to see much of her here.Watching all of...the shorts only takes about 30 minutes, so if you loved the show you might as well check them out. However, casual fans wouldn't miss much by skipping them. Crunchyroll didn't bother picking this up for some reason, so you'll have to find a fansub. the shorts only takes about 30 minutes, so if you loved the show you might as well check them out.

Where the main series focuses mostly on the group dealing with the collision of everyday situations and their extraordinary circumstances and personalities, this has nearly zero group content.This OVA, is almost entirely short snapshots of one girl dealing with her day to day stuff.  Be it the problems of sharing the bathroom in a house with all those monsters. There\'s...also the great question ""If you are a dullahan can you be a chunibyo ?""The presentation is also a bit off. These would really be best to watch along with the series maybe interspersed in the episodes and you certainly have to see the series first.Recommendation: If you have seen the main series it\'s well worth the watch. also the great question ""If you are a dullahan can you be a chunibyo ?""The presentation is also a bit off.
