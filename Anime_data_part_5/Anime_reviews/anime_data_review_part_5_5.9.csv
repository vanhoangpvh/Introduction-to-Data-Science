Ys: Tenkuu no Shinden - Adol Christine no Bouken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1277/Ys__Tenkuu_no_Shinden_-_Adol_Christine_no_Bouken,"[""Ancient Books of Ys Part II picks right up immediately following the events of the first series.  Obviously you will not understand anything that is going on if you don’t see that first.  This sequel doesn’t disappoint either, except maybe with its length since I would have loved to see a lot more of this story.At the start of the story Adol finds himself in a land that is in even more misery and peril than the land he just saved from evil.  The story takes place on the floating island that was sealed away from the rest of the earth to...keep evil away.  We saw flashbacks to this event in the first series.  This land is called Ys, and here evil is in complete control and the people live in fear and misery as they are forced to offer sacrifices of their people to appease the monsters.  The townspeople are initially wary and fearful of Adol but he is able to eventually make some allies and the plot unfolds to reveal the true villain behind all the evil and brings us to the inevitable final battle.Overall the story is much more complex than the previous one and doesn’t rely as much on the formulaic episodes it did before.  It also has a much darker tone and more emotional complexity and drama.  The action is pretty good but much like the first series, the battles unfold pretty much as they did before.  There is a lot more special effects and magic than before which visually make the battles more interesting and exciting.   The ending is a bit bittersweet as I was hoping for something different, but in a way is so typical of anime, especially from this time period.Most of the same characters return, though some not until the very end.  Adol grows more as a character and shows a bit more personality and depth than he did before.  We also get introduced to a new character, Lilia who is very interesting and gets a lot of screen time and we learn a lot about her and her past.  The other supporting characters are even more cliché and cardboard like than they were in the first season.  This is especially true of the new allies from Ys.  The Goddesses Rena and Feena are disappointing too.  This is mainly due to the length of the series I think.  The villain is also not very well developed.  He is very one dimensional and uninteresting.  But overall this series is carried by the very good Adol and Lilia characters.The art is where this series excels over its predecessor.  The characters look a lot better and more detailed.  Gone is Adol's poufy hair and a more modern hairstyle takes over, much like we see in today’s shows.  The backgrounds are still very exceptional like the first series.  But the series does suffer with some inconsistency with the art.  While it’s good, Adol and Lilia look at times to be different ages.  In the beginning of the story Lilia looks like she’s maybe 9 or 10 years old, by the end she’s looking more like a teenager.  Adol’s age and size seem to vary as well.  That aside, considering the age of this show the art is really pretty good.  Sound wise it is identical to the first series, same songs, same music and effects.Despite being a tad disappointed in the ending that was really just a personal desire.  Overall this series is really good.  I would have liked it to be longer but I give my recommendation to anyone who wants to see a nicely crafted fantasy adventure story. keep evil away.

"Touch: Miss Lonely Yesterday - Are kara, Kimi wa...",https://myanimelist.net/anime/1540/Touch__Miss_Lonely_Yesterday_-_Are_kara_Kimi_wa,"['I love Adachi works deep from my heart specialy Touch serie, as for this movie i have to be honest i liked it more or less since it focus more on romance genre deeply, anyone who saw the serie (wich is a masterpiece) might feel as i did after watching this movie, maybe cause it doesnt develop the way you want till almost the end? the art as always is perfect, sound is good enough, story is the weakest point in this movie since it wont tell nothing much new other than the hard relationship between Minami and Tatsuya.Overall its Good, so theres no reason...for you to not watch it :)just dont expect much as you did on Touch serie. for you to not watch it :)just dont expect much as you did on Touch serie.', ""After seeing some negative reactions regarding this show, i thought that i should give another perspective to what i've understand and enjoyed in the seriesThis is a sequel to the ending to touch. no mistake about that. And this movie justifies the last episode of the series.I will assume you've watched the series already because in the last episode we see the hesitation from Tatsuya about his overall feelings in baseball and Minami. in my opinion, It left me wondering if there's any affirmation if both of them (minami)  will work together. AND definitely this movie tackles that AFFIRMATION.the new character is...a plot device, no other reason other than that. BUT how she was presented was very acceptable.The decisions they've made in the movie are justified. Maybe because i'm not young anymore, i can understand that life makes us lost all the time. That goes for Tacchan and Minami. They've achieved the Dream to Koshien leaving them wondering what the next big thing is, but in life there is no big thing, unless you make the big step to break in your shell.Overall the show made the couple's feelings more stronger for the better. It reflects how we should accept things  as the way it should be.We see that in the end. Tachhan pursues his dream with Minami in his heart, while Minami waits for him until the day their love comes to fruitionif i were to choose one phrase to describe the series it will beThe story of their Dream!if i were to choose one phrase to describe the Movie it will bethe Movie of Affirmation a plot device, no other reason other than that.

A movie, or a show which doesn't make any sense, You can call it a crap.The most dissaponting and worst thing about Touch, is our main female mc minami , who is the type of character who can cry anytime, and will blame (tatsuya) who is the best thing about this show, she is a type of character who knows everything but still acting like that she doesn't know anything, a character who is only playing with Our MC's emotions .( You can also call call it a review of touch )About movie-I already explained about...the story above.Ya , it's just an alternative ending of  Touch..Tatsuya  is still living for her passed away brother, he wants to move on from his past feelings but he can't decide who he is , Tatsuya or just a shadow of his brother. He has to decide, what he wants, let's see what his decision will be?Here you will encounter a new side character, whose potential wasn't used in a right way. Basically this character is meant to show  the right direction to Tatsuya,With a drama .Overall  it's a dissaponting movie.We can't ignore the unnecessary drama in the middle of story, just because it has a happy ending. the story above.Ya , it's just an alternative ending of  Touch..Tatsuya  is still living for her passed away brother, he wants to move on from his past feelings but he can't decide who he is , Tatsuya or just a shadow of his brother.

It's not written by Adachi mitsuru which is obvious from watching it but instead it's written by someone that is completely lazy and hungry for easy cash. The movie reverts all the amazing development of the characters we love and it just repeats the same things from the original series but it's done worse. There's nothing new you get to experience from watching this movie. I wish I didn't watch it because holy cow, did it leave an awful aftertaste in my mouth. Avoid at all costs!!! Just...watch Mix Meisei Story instead which is an actual sequel to Touch written by Adachi Mitsura himself and it does a far better service to the original. watch Mix Meisei Story instead which is an actual sequel to Touch written by Adachi Mitsura himself and it does a far better service to the original."", ""If you finished Touch! you definitely need to watch this and the sequel Cross Road (Kaze no Yukue) as they are honestly the true endings to the show and help clear up the fairly ambiguous ending to the original series.I'm gonna start off with saying that if you were expecting a lot of baseball in this you will be a LITTLE disappointed as Tatsuya doesn't so much as enter the field (except flashbacks to the koshien games) for plot reasons, BUT, this is honestly fine as it's explained in the movie why he stops playing baseball (don't get too upset, the sequel movie is 80%...baseball and makes up for this). To make up for this you do get some updates on the Nitta's and Nishimura and even get to see Nishimura play pro league.The story is mostly centered around Tatsuya and Minami having some struggles in their relationship as we all know by now is caused by their shared stubbornness with basic communication skills. You get updates on a lot of side characters thankfully, Harada especially gets a glow up. There is one new character who is fairly interesting but kind of falls flat as she is basically just a plot device, albeit a fairly good one. I don't want to spoil it at all but I will also warn that the pacing is a little lacking, I put this note in my review of Cross Road but these movies really seem more fit to be actual sequel seasons as they have enough content to be stretched out to probably 13 episodes per movie/plotline.All in all if you thought Touch! was even a 6/10 it would not at all be a waste of time to check out both of these movies as they only add to the general story and give you some more of what made Touch! special. Just keep in mind the stories for both movies do go by quickly and don't allow for much development outside of pre-established characters. baseball and makes up for this).

Toutotsu ni Egypt Shin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41688/Toutotsu_ni_Egypt_Shin,"[""Toutotsu ni Egypt Kami : Aww''THIS IS ADORABLE!'' are the firts words that i screamed/squeaked in the ears of my friends when I started the show, as a joke.It's 6 minutes of adorable characters and small funny and stupid absurd jokes.The sound and the music is cute and funny.Sure it isn't your typical & a realist portrait of theses mythic gods and creatures, but hey, that what make it sweet and funny.Sure it's not a masterpiece, but put your brain on ''off'' and enjoy....Give it a chance, it will sure make you smile at least.* Sorry bad english huhu. Give it a chance, it will sure make you smile at least.* Sorry bad english huhu."", 'Toutotsu is the type of educational anime that has always appeared over the years. This time, Egyptian gods are the protagonists of this definitely hilarious story. Anubis, Toth, Seth, Horus and other characters are eccentric and have peculiarities that please and convey a good feeling of pleasure with short animes, a difficult thing lately, since most of these shows appeal to anime clichés. Toutotsu manages to be exclusive and independent when it comes to the diversity of episodes. All are well produced and have very good scenes.Making a comparison with Olympia Kyklos, Toutotsu can be defined as ""The Olympia of Egypt"", where the culture and...habits of the African country are shown, based on the ancient Egyptian religion. In addition, the practice of mummification, ceramics and pizza are great historical references, which define the entire ancient civilization very well. The anime did not hesitate. In episodes of 6 minutes, there was always a god to be presented with some more characteristic of animes. This connection shows a playful and harmonious perspective. And yet, anime manages to stand out very well because of that. It is not a famous show, nor will it be remembered by many, but it pays off, for a new experience with short animes.Finally, Toutotsu is a show that I recommend to everyone. It is not significant with the shape it has, nor will it bring anything new (of course, Egyptian culture will certainly be new to many), but it is a really profitable and heated experience. For more anime with these cultural objectives. They certainly need to gain more space in Japanese productions! habits of the African country are shown, based on the ancient Egyptian religion.

I love how each character follows the same black-white-gold color scheme, it really helps them stand out in front of the vibrant watercolor-like backgrounds.Story-wise it's a little lacking, but with how short the episodes are and how most come to a show like this for the characters and not the story, this isn't too much of a problem. I love all of the references, and they aren't so reliant that if you don't get it you won't...be losing out on much!The characters are very entertaining, though not the most accurate to their mythological counterparts.Overall I really liked it and recommend it to anyone who has an interest in a short slice of life anime and Egyptian mythology, just as long as you aren't the type to get hung up on weird plots or inaccuracies. be losing out on much!The characters are very entertaining, though not the most accurate to their mythological counterparts.Overall I really liked it and recommend it to anyone who has an interest in a short slice of life anime and Egyptian mythology, just as long as you aren't the type to get hung up on weird plots or inaccuracies."", ""its a fun, cute and new anime!

I really like how there\'s a humorous story about the daily life of ancient Egyptian deities, with a touch of modernity. The characters have really memorable personalities, everyone has their distinct behaviors etc. The animation style of the gods & goddesses is a bit abstract/simple but containing the ""essence"" of each one.I\'d recommend it to everyone who likes ancient Egypt theme, short comedy or slice-of-life genre.I\'m waiting to watch the sequel as although it\'s different from most series I watched before, this will...always be a nice anime I\'ll enjoy.My favorite characters are Anubis (he\'s also my favorite Egyptian deity in general), Thoth and Bastet.

Wenet is cute too!', ""A very cute, laid back short comedy with a pleasant vibe and great characters. It's actually educational to an extent if you look up who the different gods are and what their purpose is, so you can learn something from it too. The animation is very well done and incorporates the Egyptian Hieroglyphic style into an anime style nicely. The gags aren't really the laugh-out-loud gut laugh kind of jokes, but they have a subtle charm that's very cute. I always loved ancient Egypt when I was a kid and this was fun to revisit some of what I loved about it. ""]"

12-sai.: Chicchana Mune no Tokimeki 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33419/12-sai__Chicchana_Mune_no_Tokimeki_2nd_Season,"[""The second series to a mostly ignored first season of a show which was once an OVA. Yes, this franchise has been around for a few years, but also neglected massively, and I can see why.I have not watched the OVA, so I can only base this review on the first season's experience as well as this series.Story - 6/10Not anything great story wise, just a love story of 4 12 year olds falling in love for the first time, with the bad guidance of the females' friend Marin and to the hatred of Kokoa, who is in love with Takao, and would do anything...for him as a rich smart ass. Not winning any awards story wise, but it's good enough.Art - 7/10Once again, nothing mind blowing, but in some places, such as in close ups, this show's animation is actually pretty decent for an extremely low budget production, and much better than I remember S1's art to be.Sound - 5/10Obviously the budget cuts have to be somewhere, and sound is what was chosen. The intro song is as annoyingly catchy as S1's and serves the purpose very very well, however in any sort of climax in the show, the same 30 odd second song is played. At first, the song is good. It has a nice harmony of voices which co incides with the scene well, but this is played every god damn episode. This isn't the only repeated song either, there's a selection of a few songs that are just played multiple times per episode EVERY episode and it's just annoying.FUN FACT: the singer for the OP of 12-sai S2 (Machico) is also the singer for KonoSuba S1 and 2's OPs.The VAs aren't amazing, but they're believable enough, and offer a distinct character and sound association to each character, so I guess they serve their purpose.Character - 7/10This is the main focus of the show - the characters. The main 4 characters (Ayase and Takao, Yui and Kazuma) have very standout personalities, and the show's writers do a good job of making sure that the viewer understands each character and how they feel towards their respective partners.However, then there's the main side characters: Kokoa, Inaba, Marin and Ayumu. I'll go through these in order, you'll see why.Kokoa is annoying ass bitch whose only goal in life is to destroy Ayase's relationship with Takao. Good idea, right? Spruce up the show? I would agree, if the bitch level weren't detestable level. There's a fine line between writing a bitch character and a character who you literally want to strangle. Think I'm exaggerating? I'm really not. At times, in both S1 and 2 of this show, she makes the show almost unwatchable.Inaba is sort of the half intrusive and half non intrusive popular guy at Yui's prep school. He has a crush on Yui, even though he's popular. Even though he's a cock, he's still likeable. THis is a direct contrast to Kokoa, as this guy has a purpose in the show.Marin is, to me, the friendly version of Kokoa. She's friends with Yui and Ayase, but she's just so god damn annoying. She bases all of her advice on her slut of a sister, and like Kokoa, she can make the show near unwatchable at times.And Ayumu is a nice bloke, that's it really.And then there's the other boys in the class who I forget the names of who are actually genuinely hilarious at times with their obsession with quoting the partners' best quotes. These guys are a fantastic addition to the show.Enjoyment - 7.5 (8)/10Amongst all of the ups and downs, this show is really enjoyable to me. I enjoyed both S1 and S2, even with all of their huge flaws. Would I recommend it? No. There's loads of better shows. But I still really enjoy this show, and for a low budget, throwaway show, it's pretty good.Overall 7/10. for him as a rich smart ass.

It is about 6th graders growing up and learning \'bout love and are trying to understand what ""adulthood"" is about. Firstly, the plot sucks. The drama has been always shit and the good moments are too short (mine is like last few episodes).Main plot consists of:1. Introduction and pairing partners,2. Dates.That\'s it. The others are just fillers with side characters, and almost every side-character is annoying. You can just see episodes that pair the students at the start and then skip to the last episode, and you\'ll see the main plot. The other...episodes are a bit useless because they are used to clarify that this anime is about kids growing up and knowing about love, and it doesn\'t really connect with other episodes.Animation is fine, it\'s colorful and looks alright on most cases. Occasionally, animation quality drops and few scenes reused backgrounds from previous ones.There are also scenes that you\'ll really be familiar with if you watch all the episodes, and here are some examples:1. Running around like idiots2. Date in mall3. Heroines trying their best4. Boys being assholes5. Heroines wondering about adulthood6. Cringy dramatic momentsetc.Opening song and ending song are nice to hear, but nothing stands out or memorable. The voice acting is mediocre, but lines for the side characters made it more displeasing.My enjoyment is mixed. Few episodes are actually enjoyable, but most of it are pure cringe.Overall, the cringe makes it meaningful for a bad series like this one. Is it better than the first season? Yes, of course. Do I recommend you to watch it? If you like to cringe and waste time with random animes, I\'d do so. episodes are a bit useless because they are used to clarify that this anime is about kids growing up and knowing about love, and it doesn\'t really connect with other episodes.Animation is fine, it\'s colorful and looks alright on most cases.

Here I\'m bringing a review from the spring and fall season of 2016, 12 sai chicchan na mune no tokimeki...or easier to say in English Age 12 a little heart pounding.Now we that long intro done let\'s start the review.Warning: This review will covered both seasonStory: The story featured Ayase Hanabi a 12 year old as with that age she\'s no longer consider a kid and at the same time not an adult yet with her beloved crush Takao Yuuto and her long childhood friend Aoi Yui and her crush Hiyama Kazuma as they found love with whatever bullshit their classmate pull up their ass. One thing nice about this show is PRETTY MUCH RELATABLE TO EVERYBODY and the show does play it out well. We all got tease for having the sign of love when we are kids and no kids want to admit that. However getting tease a lot bring out a lot frustration to the guys so...They just announce it as they can\'t stand seeing their girls struggle anymore from the bullies (That\'s kinda bold).Art/ Animation: The anime is done by studio OLM. Which are in charge for  Youkai watch, LBX, Pokemon and beyblade. So... I am not surprise they decide to take on this project. Well the art style is also a gigantic tone shift once you found out they also berserk (not the 2016 version). Is cute, adorable, Bubbly and charming with the out struck background to portrait the characters emotion to the animation being just amazing and pretty cute which is shown in the 2 season.Music: OP 1 show how bright and cheerful as it could be as we all felt that sort of emotion in real life and in the show. Take note on the beginning on the song""I have just woken in spring and have a new breath of sweet sensation. Then I realize the kindness in your heart"". As this part of the song is protracting our couple love in the first few episode as they are not sure whether to go out with them or not. While op 2 show the couples struggle as they are lost and they don\'t know what to do at a situation like this. Aoi is trap in a love triangle as she have to choose 1 guy as her girlfriend. Will she choose Hiyama or will she Ayumu?? While for Hanabi is realizing that she have to tell her family that she has a boyfriend while being worried that she is going to loose him in that progress. The OST is the same as the out struck animation style to portrait the couples emotion for both season.Characters: Let\'s start with my least favorite character and move slowly to my favorite character of the series Hamana Cocoa, bitch he hates you that\'s the no reason for you to trick Hanabi as your sole call ""crush"" will crush you at the end if you keep doing that. She happens to be the one character that didn\'t get enough character development as at the end of the series. She\'s still a bitch. I know she\'s meant to be the bitchy character that ALMOST every school anime should have but out of all the school bitches that I have saw she has to be the worst. Not to mention she have the other student to gang up on Hanabi to get her revenge. Next, Eiko and his gang. The newspaper reporter as they stalk on them getting some scope and report it to school magazine. Why are they above Cocoa?? At least they got the brain on when to put in the school magazine or not. If they did put it they got a lot of explanation to do to Hiyama, Takao and Tsutsumi. Ogura Marin, She\'s meant to be a lecture on giving tips to find love and solve the situation for the characters which is pretty interesting to have a character like this in a romances anime for once. Once her lecture start I have to keep reminding myself that this anime is for little kids so her lecture won\'t be ignoring. Ayase Hanabi, I got mix feeling with her. At one point I love her characteristic and some point question her mind. I know getting a boyfriend is hard and all maybe hard but still...Takao Yuuto, he\'s kind and strong heart guy at his best to protect Hanabi and his friend at the same time brave enough to introduce himself to Hanabi brother. Hiyama Kazuma, although he try. I know he try his best to Yui happy and all but his still has a lot (I mean a lot) to learn about girls feeling and try not to hurt their feeling. Mikami Inaba, The playboy of the series at same with Hanabi I like his characteristic especially when Hiyama scolded Yui for hanging out with him while finding her strap. He takes more care to Yui than Hiyama (Although Hiyama is trying his best). Aoi Yui, a strong/ smart /kind person that grow so much since episode 1 which became more than that once her fight with Hanabi and the meet up with Inaba also the argument with the argument with Hiyama. Lastly, Tsutsumi Ayumu. BEST BOY!!! Tsutsumi is probably one of the best character in the show. What started out as a cold king when he was in kindergarten slowly gain feeling for Hanabi as he regret not having her when they were a lot younger. He grew feeling to Hanabi as well as challenge Takao for her. Why is he so high on my list while Cocoa is at the bottom?? Well... He knows when to stop and he slowly grew feeling with another girl in a different school. He know buzz out from it while at the same time showing some caring feeling to Hanabi but not in a relationship way.Enjoyment: 12 Sai has is high while it\'s low but despite the characters part is still an enjoyable series... Now if I have to nip-pick it would be WHERE\'S THE KISS?? We got a kiss with Takao and Hanabi but not with Hiyama and Yui... WHAT THE HELL... I WANT MY KISS!!! SEASON 3 (If they will ever made one) MUST HAVE THE KISS!!!!! IT WAS SO CLOSE IN EPISODE 9!!! WHY DIDN\'T WE GET IT ;_;Recommendation: Overall a great series despite some split up here and there. My recommendation is a watch it.Other recommendation include Momokuri but with less drama center it. Next it would be another kids/ romance anime that is pretty similar to 12 sai but with the involvement of puberty, Naisho no Tsubomi. or easier to say in English Age 12 a little heart pounding.Now we that long intro done let\'s start the review.Warning: This review will covered both seasonStory: The story featured Ayase Hanabi a 12 year old as with that age she\'s no longer consider a kid and at the same time not an adult yet with her beloved crush Takao Yuuto and her long childhood friend Aoi Yui and her crush Hiyama Kazuma as they found love with whatever bullshit their classmate pull up their ass.

So if you expect some huge development for the couples or deep relationship drama, you most likely will be disappointed. Although at some points it actually took a more serious approach to their relationships. (fights, thoughts about the future and how long their love will last, approval by family)Those things are still handled really lightheartedly and resolved in a very short time, so mostly you'll still see the same rosey childish approach. Yes - it's childish, it's cringy, but that's exactly what this show is about. Love from the view of little...children.Quality-wise I didn't notice any change, so art, animation and sound pretty much are the same as in the first season.There's also only one single new (relevant) character to it, which basically is the male version of Cocoa (aka makes you wanna punch him in the face), and tries to steal Aoi from Hiyama.I rated it slightly lower than the first season because I felt that it was kind of a waste to mainly focus on those stupid one-sided love rivals (like Cocoa literally never had the slightest chance) at the cost of less development for the actual couples.So if you liked the first season, this one will probably be to your liking as well. children.Quality-wise I didn't notice any change, so art, animation and sound pretty much are the same as in the first season.There's also only one single new (relevant) character to it, which basically is the male version of Cocoa (aka makes you wanna punch him in the face), and tries to steal Aoi from Hiyama.I rated it slightly lower than the first season because I felt that it was kind of a waste to mainly focus on those stupid one-sided love rivals (like Cocoa literally never had the slightest chance) at the cost of less development for the actual couples.So if you liked the first season, this one will probably be to your liking as well."", ""So lets keep in consideration that this anime is 100% for a younger audience (specifically probably 12 yr old females). I feel like a lot of people ignore this aspect when rating: So anywayStory 7: There wasn't really much plot development to the second season. There was some drama put in but essentially it was just showing the characters remaining as couples and growing as couples. That was basically the point of the anime so it fulfilled it's duty.Art: The art was consistent and fine- my only issues was the wonky eyes. The problem is the eyes are large, wide-set, and basic and the eyebrows...are just lines so when the animation on the eyes isn't perfect it is very noticeable. It isn't the worst thing and is common in a lot of anime.Sound: Voice acting was great but they re-used the same sound effects over and over and the sound effects were just meh.Character: Some new characters were introduced and they added some variety to the story. There was also character growth but nothing too major. are just lines so when the animation on the eyes isn't perfect it is very noticeable.

The viewpoint character is a grumpy old man living with his grumpy old wife on their mountainside farm, who discovers the athletes living in their home and decides that he's going to help them achieve their dreams. It is utterly delightful and minus a few short lines of dialogue told entirely visually; if you go to the Ghibli museum and don't watch this film if it's on display, you are only cheating yourself.It is simple, expressive, suitable for everyone, and the sumo is accurately portrayed (insofar as there ain't no rule saying a...mouse can't wrestle). I only regret that there wasn't a large sumo mouse plush on sale in the gift shop. mouse can't wrestle).

The vibe in the theater was so comforting and soothing. The movie was so simple, cute and entertaining it made me feel very relaxed and amazed at the museum. I will definitely visit Japan again and I will definitely visit the Ghibli museum again.Entering a long review is exhausting so here\'s some copy paste. ne can see the effects of curved space by comparing a tennis court and the Earth. Start at the lower right corner of the tennis court, with a racket held out towards north. Then while walking around...the outline of the court, at each step make sure the tennis racket is maintained in the same orientation, parallel to its previous positions. Once the loop is complete the tennis racket will be parallel to its initial starting position. This is because tennis courts are built so the surface is flat. On the other hand, the surface of the Earth is curved: we can complete a loop on the surface of the Earth. Starting at the equator, point a tennis racket north along the surface of the Earth. Once again the tennis racket should always remain parallel to its previous position, using the local plane of the horizon as a reference. For this path, first walk to the north pole, then turn 90 degrees and walk down to the equator, and finally turn 90 degrees and walk back to the start. However now the tennis racket will be pointing backwards (towards the east). This process is akin to parallel transporting a vector along the path and the difference identifies how lines which appear ""straight"" are only ""straight"" locally. Each time a loop is completed the tennis racket will be deflected further from its initial position by an amount depending on the distance and the curvature of the surface. It is possible to identify paths along a curved surface where parallel transport works as it does on flat space. These are the geodesic of the space, for example any segment of a great circle of a sphere. the outline of the court, at each step make sure the tennis racket is maintained in the same orientation, parallel to its previous positions.

Akuma no Riddle,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19429/Akuma_no_Riddle,"[""Anime Review No.8Akuma no Riddle an anime about 12 girl assassins enrolled in a prestigious private high school where they are gathered there for one reason and that is to kill the daughter of a very powerful and influential clan in japan. The plot is already not promising for it’s kind of one sided. Oh come on? 1 vs 12 and they are assassins for crying out loud! But the story have a twist one of the assassins named Tokaku Azuma decided to protect her for unknown reason giving the targeted girl named “ Haru Ichinose” a chance to survive. This anime is something you...can expect to be good because it’s like the same with Mirai Nikki in terms of two partners helping each other to win the battle royal in a yuri type of way but entirely after finishing this show you will be disappointed for you can’t understand what is going on about the show?“Warning this review may contain spoilers but if you want to be save by not wasting your time to badly written animated show please here me out”.Plot (3/10)There are so many elements and events that make the plot badly written to the point you can’t understand the show anymore. It’s not your fault if you can’t understand the show. It’s the plot’s fault for not giving proper explanation on what’s going on. I list down below the major plot holes they carelessly didn’t give a damn for the viewers to better understand the flow of the plot.\uf0e8\t1st is that the Tournament rule mechanics is not properly explained. Even though they did explain the rules for just a “few seconds” you can’t understand what are the penalties and other alternatives that rule can offer. They just let the action do the explaining in which in the end just make the viewers and also me so confuse in what the heck is happening to the show. We don’t know what happen to the girl if she failed to assassinate the girl and another thing is that does the rules even fair to begin with? The girls are randomly selected to kill haru but do the girls have the right to interfere just to give them the chance to kill haru in case the present challenger failed? The problem of the rules is it doesn’t give a clear explanation how it works which make the battle royal pointless.\uf0e8\tAnother thing is that Haru background story is unclear why the black classes wanted to kill her. Being in an influential family is not enough for an explanation.\uf0e8\tThe logic of the show is screwed. Why do haru even push herself to study in a school where she already knows that all her classmates will attempt to kill her?\uf0e8\tBeing friends with the people who will try to kill you is very stupid mindset even in the most common sense.\uf0e8\tThe show present flashbacks to characters at first it was understandable but as the story move’s forward I cannot even understands each of the story.\uf0e8\tThe story is trying to make the characters feel dramatic or I call it the “FEELS” factor which is useless for the characters have no depth. You cannot make character depth in a few seconds of a flashback which is another weak factor for the plot.\uf0e8\tThe plot is so train wreck you cannot take it seriously for the action makes no sense.\uf0e8\tLastly the biggest plot hole is that haru manage to survive just because the characters who have the 100% chance of killing her and win the game goes full retard in at the last second and always give Tokaku the “prince charming figure” the chance to save the damsel of distress from its assailants. Obvious plot armor.Characters (3/10)The characters have no originality if you watched a lot of anime with typical stereotype of personalities it is not hard to identify.  Major weaknesses of the characters by the ff.\uf0e8\tIf you are going to kill someone never give a second thought that’s not assassin like. The moment I always see this scene the more I discover this girls are not really mature assassins but immature children going on crazy because of puberty.\uf0e8\tThe logic of Tokaku being allied with haru is senseless. They just met for a few hours, talk about each other’s pass and exchange some dialogues and boom what we got Tokaku changing of heart out of the blue’s thought the so called manipulation ability of haru explained in the last episode make’s sense but still it's confusing if you need to endure 11 more episodes.\uf0e8\tThe action’s and logical reasoning of the characters is so predictable in the point you’re annoyed.\uf0e8\tPretentious dialogues. My issues of this show for what they say is different on what they act.Sound (2/10)Characters songs are pointless if you don’t like the characters.Art (5/10)I will give an average score for the good action scenes, knife slicing, explosions and girl punches.Enjoyment (2/10)I just enjoyed the small scale action and nothing more.Overall (3/10)This anime is not about assassin being mature but it’s just show killing people is “Immature”. Immature violence and nothing really happens in the story. Nobody dies and everybody lives happily ever after like the story just makes a reason for the girls to kill and hurt each other in the first place. can expect to be good because it’s like the same with Mirai Nikki in terms of two partners helping each other to win the battle royal in a yuri type of way but entirely after finishing this show you will be disappointed for you can’t understand what is going on about the show?“Warning this review may contain spoilers but if you want to be save by not wasting your time to badly written animated show please here me out”.Plot (3/10)There are so many elements and events that make the plot badly written to the point you can’t understand the show anymore.

Akuma no Riddle is very much a show that exhibits these types of expectations. It sets the stage for a high-school battle royale well enough by introducing 12 female assassins, each with their own desires, and one target, a girl striving to survive the oncoming ordeal. The assassins and target must all participate in Myoujou Academy’s elusive Black Class, where they’ll assume the guise of high-school students,...and whoever is able to successfully kill the target may have their any wish granted. However, due to a twist of events, one assassin successfully defects to the target’s side, vowing to protect her at all costs. It is quite an exciting premise and definitely promises those characteristic expectations of assassins. Unfortunately, Akuma no Riddle falls short on the delivery of said expectations and is ultimately a weak series. That is not to say that it fails solely because of its lack of deliverance. Rather, the series’ shortcomings can be directly attributed to a much greater, fundamental flaw located right at its very core. That and one particular misfire that brings down all hopes of the show had of being redeemed.The particular assassin that defects to the target’s (Haru Ichinose) side is Azuma Tokaku, the central character of Akuma no Riddle. We are affixed to her presence from the show’s very beginning and quickly learn that she is stoic, reserved, and not the most determined assassin out of the bunch. Her reason for defection is not initially made clear by the series though this is not a hindrance but a gateway for speculation that Tokaku has become subtlety attracted to Haru. Tokaku is very much the protagonist of the series though, due to her newfound predicament, she finds Haru, the series deuteragonist, in her company more often than not. Haru is a surprisingly cheery and optimistic girl for a girl of her position, and her grand desire is to achieve friendship with the assassins and graduate from the Black Class, not as enemies but as friends. It seems to be a vain goal but, we learn that through Haru’s past experiences, she has been shaped to think like this. The main characters don’t have the strongest or most convincing characterization they could but, it is done well enough to make them interesting to follow. What’s more interesting than their individual characteristics is their relationship. Tokaku and Haru share an inevitable bond that grows stronger with each assassination attempt, which is a pleasure to watch. It is probably one of the the series’ greatest strength. It’s not long before the series sets us free to discover the other 11 assassins and their motives. The quality of their characterization varies, but Akuma no Riddle sets out to define each and every assassin to their distinct character. However, the success of this greatly hindered by the great limitation of the series: its very own formula.Harkening back to the rules of the Black Class, assassins must hand in an advance notice to Haru in order for their assassination to be considered valid. From there, they must successfully execute their assassination within a 48-hour limit. Failure upon doing so means expulsion from the Black Class. In retrospect this is where the series limits itself. This is not an apparent limitation but it’s how Akuma no Riddle handles this rule that causes the series to become restricted. From the start of the assassination game, the series decides to formally focus on usually one assassin and their assassination attempt per episode. This type of formula of focusing on a different character each episode is a familiar one, so it’s all up to the execution to make sure that it’s an effective episode with strong characterization and memorable moments. Akuma no Riddle fails to deliver here. With the conflict of the show’s premise (Tokaku protecting Haru from her assassination), the 48-hour time limit, and only one assassination attempt per assassin, it’s obvious that there can be only one outcome. For the sake of the show to continue, it should be no surprise that Haru and Tokaku are able to prevail over their opponents, resulting in the opposing assassin being disqualified, never to be seen at Black Class again. This type of formula can get tired fast and yet, Akuma no Riddle decides to let it dictate nearly the entire series. It gets old seeing the same thing twice, nevertheless the 8th time as well. By deciding to have this formula, the series allows itself to become entrapped in a web of predictability. It doesn’t matter what happens to the protagonists in each episode because you know what the outcome will be. Surprise is effectively killed, despite the series’ best attempts to shake it up now and then. It is a breathe of fresh air when the series does shake it up, but the problem is that the formula is still there when it really shouldn’t be. It’s probably the most roundabout & counterintuitive way to execute the series’ premise.Predictability is not the formula’s sole crime however. A very important and much focused on aspect of this series is affected as well: characterization. Each episode has a focus character and the show wastes no time in its attempts to characterize them and flesh them out. However, with solely one episode to work on a character (who probably didn’t get a lot of spotlight because prior episodes focused on different characters) Akuma no Riddle’s attempts at characterization are ineffective and insubstantial. There’s just not enough time to develop these assassin-of-the-week characters who won’t be seen again and any attempts that are made are just shallow. Usually a good option for this one-episode-character trope is to have these characters leave an imprint on the main characters and have them develop instead. However, Akuma no Riddle has no desire to do this. It solely attempts to develop these side-characters who will ultimately have no significant outcome on the story. It is entirely futile and the series doesn’t do a particularly good job at making us care for these characters anymore than we did before, no matter how tragic the character is. It’s thanks to this formula of strictly focusing on side characters that the series forgets to focus on the more interesting aspects of the series, like Tokaku and Haru’s relationship. If Akuma no Riddle had focused more on their relationship, we generally would have gotten character development that mattered and watching it would’ve been more rewarding.With surprise taken out and weak characterization in abundance, surely Akuma no Riddle should be able to soar with exciting, thrilling and aesthetic action. After all, the formula is not strict enough that it needs the action to subscribe to it. As I said earlier, Akuma no Riddle is not able to completely deliver upon these expectations. Assassinations are not as clever or exciting as one would expect. Most assassinations don’t have much effort put into them, they lack effectiveness and creativity, almost as if the assassins aren’t really trying to seriously kill Haru. Though this is unconvincingly addressed by the series later on, it doesn’t make it any more engaging. There’s a point where the series understandably breaks free from its formula, and surprisingly enough, it is almost able to redeem itself. The final three episodes are able to deliver thrilling revelations, truly exciting action, and well-built momentum for an engaging, albeit confusing, finale.  However, it is what directly follows the finale that permanently sinks Akuma no Riddle. An epilogue that is meant to give closure to the series, while also attempting to please the viewer ends up becoming a complete misfire. It’s confounding in its own right, but as a direct cause of being an immediate follow-up to the climax, it becomes incredibly jarring and backwards. The finale sets up a definite ending, one that is understandable, and a good one for the series. The epilogue completely rewrites this climax, undermining it as well as everything else the series had built up prior. The bizarreness of this epilogue is outstanding that it’s almost surreal and its disparity with the rest of the series is too apparent.Akuma no Riddle had all the pieces, but assembly led to mistakes that ultimately brought down the series. It is still has its enjoyable aspects however. Animation, while not incredibly impressive overall, conveys the fight scenes and action quite well. The soundtrack accompanies scenes well, and while nothing stands out, it fits into the background nicely. Character design does stand out thankfully and each assassin has a memorably distinct design, setting them apart from the rest. The OP ""Soushou Innocence"" is notable in delivering a fittingly moody & energetic tune that fits well with the opening animation. Regarding the EDs, Akuma no Riddle generously gives nearly every assassin their own song which can serve as further characterization as to who they are. For example, the 8th ED ""Mayonaka no Toubou"" is able to effectively exude the melancholic delusion of a character through its lyrics, tune, and visuals. The art for these EDs are in good quality as well, matching the characters nicely and further indirectly characterizing them. It’s a shame that the series was not able to deliver the same level of characterization with such conviction.Even with Akuma no Riddle becoming a slave to its own formula, it can still be enjoyed. Tokaku and Haru’s relationship is pleasant to see (when it is actually focused on), the action is decent, reaching an all time high near the end, and some of the characters can still be entertaining (notably the ones given more prominence than others). However, its formula is its greatest enemy, bringing down the deliverance of expectations, characterization, as well as the effectiveness of its story. Along with a questionable epilogue, Akuma no Riddle is weakened and restricted from crafting the exciting, thrilling and aesthetic battle royale it wanted to be. and whoever is able to successfully kill the target may have their any wish granted. However, due to a twist of events, one assassin successfully defects to the target’s side, vowing to protect her at all costs. It is quite an exciting premise and definitely promises those characteristic expectations of assassins. Unfortunately, Akuma no Riddle falls short on the delivery of said expectations and is ultimately a weak series. That is not to say that it fails solely because of its lack of deliverance. Rather, the series’ shortcomings can be directly attributed to a much greater, fundamental flaw located right at its very core. That and one particular misfire that brings down all hopes of the show had of being redeemed.The particular assassin that defects to the target’s (Haru Ichinose) side is Azuma Tokaku, the central character of Akuma no Riddle. We are affixed to her presence from the show’s very beginning and quickly learn that she is stoic, reserved, and not the most determined assassin out of the bunch. Her reason for defection is not initially made clear by the series though this is not a hindrance but a gateway for speculation that Tokaku has become subtlety attracted to Haru. Tokaku is very much the protagonist of the series though, due to her newfound predicament, she finds Haru, the series deuteragonist, in her company more often than not. Haru is a surprisingly cheery and optimistic girl for a girl of her position, and her grand desire is to achieve friendship with the assassins and graduate from the Black Class, not as enemies but as friends. It seems to be a vain goal but, we learn that through Haru’s past experiences, she has been shaped to think like this. The main characters don’t have the strongest or most convincing characterization they could but, it is done well enough to make them interesting to follow. What’s more interesting than their individual characteristics is their relationship. Tokaku and Haru share an inevitable bond that grows stronger with each assassination attempt, which is a pleasure to watch. It is probably one of the the series’ greatest strength. It’s not long before the series sets us free to discover the other 11 assassins and their motives. The quality of their characterization varies, but Akuma no Riddle sets out to define each and every assassin to their distinct character. However, the success of this greatly hindered by the great limitation of the series: its very own formula.Harkening back to the rules of the Black Class, assassins must hand in an advance notice to Haru in order for their assassination to be considered valid. From there, they must successfully execute their assassination within a 48-hour limit. Failure upon doing so means expulsion from the Black Class. In retrospect this is where the series limits itself. This is not an apparent limitation but it’s how Akuma no Riddle handles this rule that causes the series to become restricted. From the start of the assassination game, the series decides to formally focus on usually one assassin and their assassination attempt per episode. This type of formula of focusing on a different character each episode is a familiar one, so it’s all up to the execution to make sure that it’s an effective episode with strong characterization and memorable moments. Akuma no Riddle fails to deliver here. With the conflict of the show’s premise (Tokaku protecting Haru from her assassination), the 48-hour time limit, and only one assassination attempt per assassin, it’s obvious that there can be only one outcome.

Along with a questionable epilogue, Akuma no Riddle is weakened and restricted from crafting the exciting, thrilling and aesthetic battle royale it wanted to be.', ""The concept of the survival game and battle royal is very mainstream today and is favored also by many people, a lot of anime that uses this concept with the objective of achieving huge profits that  make anime these days feels more commercial. One of those anime is Riddle Story of Devil or commonly called Akuma no Riddle, a show that comes from Diomedea studio (known for the anime Squid Girl). The story is illustrated in Myojou Academy, a boarding school for women. The school has a special class named Black Class, containing 12 assassin who has a mission to kill 'the target' which...is in the same class as well.One of the weaknesses of this anime is the supporting element of the story that almost didn't run at all, the concept of battle royal that usually thrill and exciting can not be felt. Also, the anime is not paying attention the importance of an originality of a masterpiece, the story didn't have an identity. Furthermore, Akuma no Riddle has a plot that is very common, the plot is not well organized and feels very easily predictable from the beginning, the ending looks very forced. There are plot holes that still empty until the end of the story. Exacerbated by many unexpected fan service appear everywhere like rain.

But it doesn't fit with the story feeling, figure portrayed an assassin less on character design.Even so, there is no problem in that their actions show. In terms of sound and music, Akuma no Riddle quite above average. The opening song very lively, the ending songs is quite interesting because each episode has their own ending songs. While the voice actor does their job adequately.Deepening the characters in this story concept is difficult, let alone this show consists just 12 episodes, very difficult to make an interesting character in that short periodic of time. This happens on Akuma no Riddle, the anime impose to tell all of the character's past. But do not notice how shallow the development of the character they make, which creates a backfire to the plot. The main character also has a very weak motive and irrational reason in helping the target.Akuma no Riddle may have a lot of shortcomings in terms of story and character, but it didn't make this show very ugly until you want to dispose of this radioactive far away, maybe recommended for people who are looking for action and fight rather than a story.Finally, you like it or did not it depends on you. is in the same class as well.One of the weaknesses of this anime is the supporting element of the story that almost didn't run at all, the concept of battle royal that usually thrill and exciting can not be felt.

Here we have a show named Akuma no Riddle (translated as Riddle Story of Devil). And incidentally, we have an angel-like character with and energetic personality named Haru Ichinose who gets herself into a mess that threatens her very existence. Luckily, she’s not alone because Haru’s got a protector. Her name is Tokaku Azuma and she is not a pushover, not in the art of assassin anyways.To call Akuma no Riddle a memorable art piece though could be both an understatement and overstatement. For starters, we have a diverse and colorful cast of...characters who transfers into the infamous all-girls school known as Myojo Academy. One particular class stands out known as the ‘10th Year Black Class’. It’s here where the show tells its story as Haru is marked a target for death by the other transfer students. As a show based on setting of survival, the premise tells of a different setup. Rather than a free-for-all and every killer for themselves, it’s all against Haru. Apparently, the victor gets themselves a wish, something that I’m sure almost everyone wants if they ever had a chance to make a fantasy into a reality. While all this seems interesting at first, the first episode only introduces its premise that is underwhelming. The premise serves a device to show the deadly game as Haru becomes the prey and the transfer students are the predators. It’s easy to figure out the concepts of the game though since the show explains itself early on with the mechanics. The part where it gets confusing is the ultimate purpose of the game. Mystery draws out throughout the show like a riddle with characters in the background such as Nio Hashiri to spellbind the audience’s curiosity.Throughout the show, there’s an instinctive towards the assassin’s motivations, which differs between every character. However, one prominent attribute involves Tokaku’s will to protect Haru from harm. Her motivation is uncertain besides a few cryptic hints relating to possibly Haru’s past and herself. In essence, the show is one big riddle with her motivations and how they fight for survival at the school. For Tokaku and Haru, they develop a close and innate relationship spawned by the time they spent together. Existing as polar opposites, there’s some development between the two although the duo feels incompatible. For instance, Tokaku is someone who hates others getting close to her and dislike people referring by her first name. On the other hand, Haru is energetic, sociable, and often tries to brighten a gloom and doom atmosphere. Curiosity spawns as how these two can co-exist together as a duo when their lives are at stake every single day at the academy.Like mentioned before, each assassin is different with a different personality and even killing method of choice. In total, there are 12 of them including Azuma. Here’s where the problem comes in when it follows the adaptation. The manga has only been publishing for about a year and its inconclusive how it will end. In other words, the anime braces itself for a possible anime original ending. But that’s not really the main problem. The main flaw here is characterization and development of the assassins. As a one cour show (12 episodes), the show implies that each assassin gets only about a full episode of screen time. That’s also fallacious because in one particular episode, three assassins are eliminated all the same time while one of them didn’t even get her own chance at Haru’s life. In retrospect, it means that there will hardly be any concentration or focus on an assassin’s character. The only focus it spends is the flashbacks that often feels too centralized, predictable, and sometimes cliché. Director Keizou Kusakawa appeals to the audience with his gimmicks that quickly turns itself into a twisted game as each episode progresses on. More and more students are “transferred out” of the class, but in reality are expelled/killed. His previous works on series such as Sekirei and Campione also relied on a main character to fight for glory and triumph against other skilled adversaries. Here, it follows a similar suit only that it seems episodic in nature. By worst, the series also likes to pull out some oddball conclusion with its finale that seemingly circumnavigate backwards with its original theme but destroying the grim feelings of despair. Perhaps the unaired special OVA will find its way to depict a more accurate image.Diving into this show also will feel like dark academy adventure. To get the best experience, it would be to familiarize yourself with the various characters. This could be a problem since most of them are hardly relatable as result of their weak development. Not to mention the fact that all the assassins have deadly skills, it’s hard to picture yourself in their shoes in the first place. But luckily, there is a catch of diversity. Each episode offers something new with the characters. They attempt to kill Haru with every chance and seizes that opportunity. The methods they formulate results in creative ideas that although seems gimmicky but is also unorthodox in an unique sense. These include diffusing strategically placed bombs, fighting on stage in front of an audience in the disguise of a school play, or even literally solving riddles. And to further diversity themselves, each character has a different persona whether it’s a sadist (Isuke Inukai), innocent little girl (Hitsugi Kirigaya), assertive (Koko Kaminaga), or even one with dual personalities and among others. Haru’s presence creates a strange vibration between some of these characters as she is too fragile and incomparable to them. It mixes in the wrong way when it comes to developing any sort of relationship with them. And because they are assassins, the only relationship is decided by life and death.A variety of themes is dealt with throughout the show whether it’s friendship, jealousy, regret, or vengeance. It explores the basics of human nature in a dark way since most of the characters seems to have a troubling life based on the various flashbacks. But these concepts don’t have a profound way to express themselves. Looking at on the surface, there’s a feeling of cuteness molded with dark configuration. Even the girls that fights for “justice” plays roles as anti-heroes rather than a figure of admiration. But for what’s worth, Azuma perhaps the most dynamic character for her self-motivation to protect Haru. In attempts to protect Haru, we learn more about Azuma including parts of her past and visage as an assassin. We also see different sides of her through the relationship between the duo. But ultimately, this comes down to storytelling as the main premise is still intact throughout the series. As Haru is the main target, their relationship is tested by the human nature and instinct.It’s also explicitly shown that the show does take itself seriously, perhaps too much for its own good. Whether these are the taunting riddles, intimidating expressive eye gestures, or even torture scenes, the show makes its oddball point. But despite this dark nature, it also tries to humor the audience with its gags. These include the yuri vibes between some characters including Haru and Azuma. This shouldn’t be surprising considering the way the show is setup. But other tactics of humor attempt often includes Haru’s lack of sense and the denseness of the classes’ teacher, Ataru Mizorogi. From a motivational case, this doesn’t work right since the show has a grim and more mature setting. The girls are dead serious on killing Haru so when comedy sometimes come into play, it doesn’t balances itself right.Diomedéa, known for their previous involvement with other game scenario-esque shows such as Problem Children and NouCome adapts similar gimmicks. Only this time, it focuses on the deadly side with its character designs. In fact, every character in the show has an appeal to color themselves as a competitor. Some seems intimidating while others are innocent but all the assassins are deadly in respect when they show their true colors. This is shown prominently by how the camera focuses exclusively on their eyes. It depicts the anti-thesis of schoolgirls are like, especially in a prestigious school. They hide their true nature until the moment comes to strike just like assassins. As far as their face gesture, it crafts this gimmick right by nature. Character outfits are also decorative with distinctive figures to match their personalities. However, do expect some fan-service when it comes to pool episodes, censored bath scenes (TV version) and the shock violence that comes out as cheesy.The soundtrack isn’t a super powerhouse but does works very well as a supplement to this show when it works with the characters. The most noticeable aspect involves the ED songs as each assassin gets her own theme song (when the episode focuses on them). The OP song remains unchanged however with depiction of the assassins in femme fatale like poses and a catchy aesthetic rhythm. Not to mention, the song contains some spoilerish scenes involving their weapons. For most of the character voices, they show their tone of intimidation and violence. I’d give credit to most of their mannerisms to stay consistent with the characters. However, Haru’s voice mannerism greatly contradicts this with her innocent nature. We also get a variety of soundtrack to depict the heavy action toned sequences. Some works out right while others feels repetitive but ultimately does the job to craft a decent balance of sound mixture.Akuma no Riddle’s endgame is the fact that the show focuses exclusively more on story rather than character development. Demanding for that would leave you unsatisfied. After all, the ultimate goal of the show is to deliver Haru’s execution and fulfill the wish of an assassin. While all this sounds dandy, it also tries desperately to appeal to the audience with its misplaced comedy, shadowy flashbacks, and shallow character relationships. And although it showcases yuri at times, it isn’t a prominent feature to that end either. But the show does offer great diversity with its colorful character cast. For all its faults, the show’s raison d'etre can still be appealing and leave audience wonder who or what happens next. Make no mistake though. This show isn’t just some Romeo and Juliet story about two girls but rather their tale of survival. Because in their world, the strongest prevail and the weak perish. characters who transfers into the infamous all-girls school known as Myojo Academy.

From a motivational case, this doesn’t work right since the show has a grim and more mature setting. The girls are dead serious on killing Haru so when comedy sometimes come into play, it doesn’t balances itself right.Diomedéa, known for their previous involvement with other game scenario-esque shows such as Problem Children and NouCome adapts similar gimmicks. Only this time, it focuses on the deadly side with its character designs. In fact, every character in the show has an appeal to color themselves as a competitor. Some seems intimidating while others are innocent but all the assassins are deadly in respect when they show their true colors. This is shown prominently by how the camera focuses exclusively on their eyes. It depicts the anti-thesis of schoolgirls are like, especially in a prestigious school. They hide their true nature until the moment comes to strike just like assassins. As far as their face gesture, it crafts this gimmick right by nature. Character outfits are also decorative with distinctive figures to match their personalities. However, do expect some fan-service when it comes to pool episodes, censored bath scenes (TV version) and the shock violence that comes out as cheesy.The soundtrack isn’t a super powerhouse but does works very well as a supplement to this show when it works with the characters. The most noticeable aspect involves the ED songs as each assassin gets her own theme song (when the episode focuses on them). The OP song remains unchanged however with depiction of the assassins in femme fatale like poses and a catchy aesthetic rhythm. Not to mention, the song contains some spoilerish scenes involving their weapons. For most of the character voices, they show their tone of intimidation and violence. I’d give credit to most of their mannerisms to stay consistent with the characters. However, Haru’s voice mannerism greatly contradicts this with her innocent nature. We also get a variety of soundtrack to depict the heavy action toned sequences. Some works out right while others feels repetitive but ultimately does the job to craft a decent balance of sound mixture.Akuma no Riddle’s endgame is the fact that the show focuses exclusively more on story rather than character development. Demanding for that would leave you unsatisfied. After all, the ultimate goal of the show is to deliver Haru’s execution and fulfill the wish of an assassin. While all this sounds dandy, it also tries desperately to appeal to the audience with its misplaced comedy, shadowy flashbacks, and shallow character relationships. And although it showcases yuri at times, it isn’t a prominent feature to that end either. But the show does offer great diversity with its colorful character cast. For all its faults, the show’s raison d'etre can still be appealing and leave audience wonder who or what happens next. Make no mistake though. This show isn’t just some Romeo and Juliet story about two girls but rather their tale of survival. Because in their world, the strongest prevail and the weak perish."", ""Ok, so this is my first review and I'll be as honest and thorough as possible for an readers.Ok so basically Akuma no Riddle is about a girl named Haru who has to survive a classroom full of assassins.  That's really the gist of it.  That being said, let me move on to my scores and why I rated them as such.Story: 4/10The story was very much lacking in this show, and I say that with utter disappointment.  This was a show that when it first started, had the set up to be an awesomely written masterpiece full of character development and...plot twists.  Sadly, that didn't happen.  I was hoping for characters that were in the class for ulterior motives, or that had such an elaborate plan that it lasted longer than one episode.  This didn't happen at all.  This show is basically a generic battle-royal.  Not that I have anything against battle-royal style anime and manga, but I honestly expected more out of the show and its characters.The other disappointing thing, was that whenever a particular assassin was the focal point of an episode, that was it.  They got one episode and then done.  They got two episodes only if they didn't start their battle in the beginning of their first one.Art: 7/10The art was pretty good.  It wasn't anything stellar and it certainly had some horrifically drawn moments, but those were very rare and it had plenty of other scenes where the art looked excellent.  Not a master piece, but certainly above average.Sound: 10/10The sound was probably the highlight of the show.  The tracks during the fight scenes were good, and the tracks during emotional scenes were good as well.  The best part however, were the OP and the EDs.  The OP was amazing, and each assassin had her own ED.  So basically when it was that assassin's turn in the show, it played their ED at the end.  All of the endings were unique and very very good.  The lyrics also reflected the characters extremely well.  If you are a fan of anime music, this would definitely be a reason to check out the show.Character: 6/10This pretty much plays off the same reasoning I had with the story score.  Just as there was a lack of plot twists and really good story development, there was an extreme lack of character development as well.  None of the characters were outright terrible to begin with, and some were more interesting than others off the bat.  Their personal reasons for wanting to assassinate Haru were pretty much all interesting too, but that's all you get from them.  Like I said under story, after they get their one episode spotlight, that's it.  So character development really becomes impossible.Enjoyment: 7/10I rate this as high as I do, simply because I enjoyed it for what it was; a battle-royal high school anime.  Sure if I take into account the poor story, lack of character development, and the ending (wont spoil it at all, but just me personally, I didn't enjoy it) then I would rate it a lot lower.  That's precisely why my overall score is lower.  BUT if you take the show at face value and just accept it for being a generic battle-royal with a bunch of fighting between unique assassins, then it's pretty entertaining to watch.Overall: 5/10When I take every part of the show into consideration, I cant score it anything better than mediocre.  While it didn't completely blow at anything, it didn't excel at anything either, especially in parts it should have.  The story could have been SOOO much more, and along those lines a better story could have brought much more in depth characters.  I wont say it isn't enjoyable to watch, but if you're looking for some masterpiece of a story, with characters that will blow your mind, then this show is not for you.  If you're just looking for an action anime, with good music and very minimum yuri, then you might want to take a look at Akuma no Riddle.Just an extra tid-bit here - but if you're one of those people that flocks to the manga to get more details or if the anime has a bad adaptation, then don't.  This is one of the EXTREMELY RARE cases where the anime is better than the manga...and I mean significantly better. plot twists.  Sadly, that didn't happen.

Potential seems to be the name of the game now-a-days, and if you have it you must be good, right? This was an example of that being completely, and truly, false.Story - 6/10If you\'re here, you\'ve probably heard this anime referred to as the ""DanganRonpa with Yuri"". As of  finishing the series, I can assure you, that this was partially true. This, like DanganRonpa, had a lot of potential and a very interesting plot going in. This also shares DanganRonpa\'s somewhat bad traits by having everything culminate into next to nothing....However, in Dangan, it\'s next to nothing. Here, we get absolutely nothing. Nothing changes throughout the course of the series, and it leaves me with a very bland feeling that nothing was accomplished after 12 episodes.Now, this would be minor spoilers, but the tags on MAL are wrong. If you are watching this purely for Yuri, you will be extremely disappointed. There is very little Yuri, if you could even call it that. Maybe if you have some pretty intense Yuri googles, you might enjoy this.Art - 8/10Let\'s be honest, the art is really good, and the animation is beautiful. I do recognize that it is 2014, but we still have shows like Kill La Kill that look terrible. Yes, I know that money is a factor, but it still doesn\'t excuse poor animation. Anyways, the animation in Akuma no Riddle is very fluid and looks amazing. Very few corners were cut here, and we don\'t have books covering peoples mouths so they didn\'t have to animate them talking...Sound - 8/10This is and Art are the only places Akuma no Riddle shines. This anime had some very enjoyable OST\'s that really fit the feel and mood of the show. But the thing that really stood out to me was that each ending of this show is unique, and each has a unique song. This is something that may have been done before, but I have never seen this before, and it shows that the creators at least put something into creating this show. I liked this most of all, but I\'m not someone who\'s big on the OP/ED of shows. I much prefer the actual content, and a bad/good opening/ending doesn\'t really reflect the content within the show for me.Characters - 4/10The way the story develops the characters is in a really poor way. It goes the route of introducing them each individually. Then, it will give you the characters backstory. The problem with this is all the side characters shove out the mains and leave them with less development time. I\'m not fan of this way of character development at all because now I feel like I know next to nothing about any of the characters, because the screen time was too evenly split. Therefore, it\'s more like things doing actions rather than an actual character you can grab on to.Overall/Enjoyment - 4Honestly, I was very disappointed by Akuma no Riddle. I thought it would be this new innovative anime that would really try to branch out and do its own thing and end up amazing. This was not the case as it reverted to the old tried and true methods that we\'ve all seen before.So, in conclusion, I would not recommend this anime to almost anyone, as it has my cliffhangers and boring design choices that left me yearning for what could have been, instead of what we got.

Both certainly have their pro\'s and con\'s and even though they are similar in terms of topic, I don\'t feel the need to compare them.Today I will be reviewing the highly anticipated yuri hyped anime known as Akuma no Riddle....Story - 6/10Akuma no Riddle (AnR for short) is set in a high school (because apparently nothing interesting ever happens outside of one) in which 12 assassins have chosen to partake in some sort of a contest. The assassins share one common interest. Each with the goal of assassinating our main protagonist Ichinose Haru with the hopes that they will receive the prize that comes with it. A chance to make one request of any kind a reality, but if they fail their attempt they are expelled and forced to leave the competition. This is where our main heroine Tokaku comes to play. Even though her original mission was to assassinate Haru, she grows fond of her and decides to be the one that protects her. Now it is 11 assassins vs one target and a protector.The overall premise of the story isn\'t really unheard of with there being a competition in which one must kill to succeed, but I applaud it for trying to bring a more refreshing topic in mind.The problem with this story is that after you finish the series it leaves you with no fulfillment. They manage to create so many asspulls and plotholes in one abrupt moment, that after you are finished with the series it makes you feel that everything you\'ve learned or seen about the characters had no meaning in the end. You are just left there; confused with a bunch of questions unanswered.Art - 8/10Although the style of art in an anime shouldn\'t be the deciding factor of whether or not its worth watching or not, (Ping Pong the animation being the greatest example I can think of) I constantly see my opinions being influenced because of it. I found myself having no problems with Akuma no Riddle\'s art quality. AnR\'s art quality was actually quite nice. It fits the quality of an 2014 anime (of a 2014 anime art style) and is actually above average during its high points. The fight scenes were interesting and nice to look at, but the art that really stood out for me was the custom ending\'s (ED\'s) made for each antagonist in the anime. I found that these were creative, well thought out, and well executed. These little things I feel help differentiate from your typical anime and is definitely refreshing to see.Sound - 8/10The soundtrack of AnR is actually on par. The opening ""Soushou Innocence"" is very catchy, and has its high moments. (especially when it gets to the chorus) The different ED\'s was what made this area stand out. Choosing to play a different ending song every episode was very interesting and having it sung by the characters themselves was an exceptional bonus as well. The combination of these endings was what made each of them stand out on its own and was well executed. The OST\'s in this anime are okay, but none of them really struck me as something that stands out on its own. That being said, it wasn\'t bad. Overall as long as the soundtrack helped compliment the anime, then it has done its job, which I felt it has.Character - 6/10This is the section where I feel AnR required some work in. I enjoy yuri as much as the next person, but I felt that the other characters (the antagonists) were basically just catalysts for Tokaku and Haru to build their relationship and nothing more. Any form of character development from the antagonist\'s are thrown out of the window, as after their \'feature\' episode, they are basically gone without any recognition in the later episodes except for possibly a few mentions. This is why this anime feels a bit empty. Any form of bond gained between the antagonist\'s and the viewers are cut, never to be seen again. (I should write my own drama novel lmao) Overall, i\'m just disappointed in this section as if it payed more attention to its side characters it could have shined.Enjoyment - 7/10Overall before ending - 7.5/10 Overall after ending - 6/10Overall, I felt that I did not regret watching this. Although there are components that prevented this anime from excelling,it was not done terribly.  Hell, i\'d even recommend it to some people if they enjoy anime\'s like these with an assassination type feel, but it certainly wouldn\'t be the top choice i\'d recommend for that type of anime. If the premise and the synopsis interest you, then you should check it out BUT lower your expectations. After finishing this series/ending with high expectations, I was quite dissapointed. There are some parts that are ridiculously stretched (when you find it, you\'ll see it clearly) and just dissapoints me because this anime had the potential to be so much more. If you are planning to watch this anime don\'t expect this to be a breakthrough in its genre or you will be quite dissapointed.

That being said, the series is very good. I mean, the entire series is based on teenage girl assassins, with very little side story. What\'s not to like? Throw a little yuri into it and it becomes a fairly interesting series.A brief summary: The story is set at Myoujou Academy, a private girls\' boarding school. The 10th year\'s Kurogumi (Black) class has 12 assassins with their sights on one target, Haru Ichinose. Tokaku Azuma is a recent transfer student who is also targeting Ichinose,...but she gradually develops feelings for Ichinose, and becomes her protector. And that\'s really all you need to know. The show\'s plot is very straight forward and basic at best. But it has a ton of action, with some puzzles that need to be solved. But the viewer doesn\'t really need to solve them. Tokaku solves them for you. LOLEach episode centers around one or two of the assassins and their attempt to assassinate Haru. During the episode, you learn of their motives, and reasoning behind why they are participating. Each assassin has a unique situation which drives them which is something I really enjoyed about the series.In regards to the music and ""art"", they both were very good in the series. Each episode has it\'s own ED, which is very unique and something I rarely see. The character were drawn fantastically and the animation is spot on.Probably the biggest negative I have is the length. I think the series could\'ve used another few episodes to further explain things. At a few points, I felt the episode and series was being rushed a tad bit due to the time constraints.Overall, Akuma No Riddle isn\'t the best series of the season, but it\'s far from being bad. It\'s filled with a ton of action, and doesn\'t stray too far from it\'s straight forward plot. The premise of the series kept me interested, and the series should keep you entertained if you aren\'t looking for a series that requires a ton of wit and thinking. but she gradually develops feelings for Ichinose, and becomes her protector.

The characters indeed lack depth and development for viewers to sympathize with their hardships and trials, this include the two main characters Tokaku and Haru. The story didn\'t progress...much from the given plot either as one can already predict exactly what will happen except maybe in the last few episodes which in my opinion have plot devices coming out of nowhere without proper build up.However, with brain turned off, Akuma no Riddle can be quite enjoyable. The fight scenes have such fluid animation and are so fun that I didn\'t even mind much that they are unrealistic and in times dumb and does not make sense. The romance factor, though not as well handled as the action do have some of its moments and are able to entertain for a bit.In conclusion, if you don\'t have anything else to watch, try Akuma no Riddle, why not? Though it\'s not exactly the ""I highly recommend this!"" type of anime, it can be fun. just don\'t question it\'s logic too much, your head will explode much from the given plot either as one can already predict exactly what will happen except maybe in the last few episodes which in my opinion have plot devices coming out of nowhere without proper build up.However, with brain turned off, Akuma no Riddle can be quite enjoyable.

This show is utter shit.TL;DR: Fuck this show. Do not watch it.**SPOILERS**Art: Let\'s start with the one somewhat positive note.  The art. I gave it a 7/10, the animation was decent and the action wasn\'t terrible by any means.Sound: I am genuinely curious whether the sound director even watched the show he or she was controlling the soundtrack for, because the music in this show just does not convey the proper tone. I found it to be laughable...at many points.  There would be a casual scene or a slightly on edge conversation and intense piano music would play in the background, or a symphonic piece would be in the background.  This had me on edge and waiting for a significant, suspenseful, and tense scene that just did not appear.  I suppose that this can be blamed on the show not delivering what was necessary in the writing, which it certainly did not. Overall, some of the other music was passable, so 3/10.Character: I was curious on how they would handle the large number of characters in this show, and my answer is: poorly. For most of this show it is basically one character has their chance to assassinate Haru, and then fails and then leaves the show.  So for each characters episode there was an attempt to set up a backstory and provide motivation for the characters actions.  However, these attempts were futile providing insufficient motivations and hopelessly attempting to give two dimensional characters some substance.  As far as the main two characters go, they were equally disappointing. Tokaku was the stereotypical emotionless badass who wins every time.  But I will admit, I found her assassin backstory to be somewhat compelling at times, but she often comes off as an emotionless robot and never really sells me on her love for Haru.  And Haru is nothing but a ditsy, hopeless, happy, upbeat, piece of cardboard.  Can you actually expect me to believe that you got all those scars and had all those people die and act so normally?  And how can you be so stupid as to think that you can befriend the assassins trying to fucking KILL YOU? I hate Haru.  All in all, 2/10 characters.Story: Dear sweet mother of Christ, this story was shit.  First of all, it is a show about assassins, but NO ONE DIES.  NO ONE FUCKING DIES IN THIS ENTIRE GOD DAMN SHOW.  I am not someone who needs death, a show can be great without it, but this show is about assassins who want to kill Haru and will kill others to do so.  It is simply unrealistic that no one dies.  And the way that they just unkill some of the characters (the chick with mama and papa and Romeo and Juliet assassins specifically) just removes all the weight of their deaths, trivializing some of the actions in the show.  And that last episode, with Haru ""manipulating"" Tokaku, it was so clear that Haru cared for Tokaku, and that Tokaku cared for Haru, so who cares? No but Tokaku literally FUCKING TRIES TO MURDER HARU! What the fuck?  That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen in a story.  I have to wonder whether anyone read the first draft of the script before having the voice actors read it for the show. 1/10Enjoyment: Some times it was fun to watch how absurdly bad this show is. 3/10Overall: Terrible. 1/10 at many points.

I feel that adding this concept into a seemingly on the surface, slice of life anime makes it fresh, though, in reality this series is far from a slice of life. Seeing attractive young ladies showing their grit and fighting for their lives, is not something I\'ve seen in many anime series, hence it...seems kinda fresh in my perspective.As for the progression of the storyline, the only thing that gets me down is the predictability of the progression of the series. It starts with a 1v1 duel and pretty much stays that way throughout the rest of the series. Platonic, but it is something i do not mind going back to after each episodeArt: 8The art in Akuma no Riddle is fantastic on the front of character design. All of the 13 girls each bear a strikingly distinct feature that sets them apart from the rest of the cast. All of these characters are beautifully drawn to life and are all pleasant to the eyes, as all girls are.Then again, one serious drawback in the art department would be the realism of the action sequences in the anime. There are times where fight sequences seem a tad bit too ""low budget"" with very underwhelming actions and repetitive simple animation. Yes, this is an anime on assassins. These people are trained to kill, but the anime struggles in illustrating what could be the most important selling point in the anime. The ""action"" in an ""action"" genre animeSound: 9I personally feel that this is one of the aspects which Akuma no Riddle excels in. The anime is a short 12 episodes , and runs with a single opening. However not only is the opening engaging and fast paced, the 12 unique endings based on each character add spice to each episode, making the audience want to watch all the way to the end of the episode. This unique twist also allows fans of the different characters to take back a piece of their own, in the enjoyment of that particular character. Something that is very fresh in anime today, which I hope I can see more in the futureCharacter: 7Despite the show\'s short running episode series, 12 episodes proved sufficient in capturing almost all of the different characters in the anime. Despite it being ""sufficient"". To introduce this much back story for each of the characters in such a short time is not just ""ok"". its a pretty damn good achievement on its own. Its a shame that the anime had to move so quickly, but I applaud the creators on that feat.Enjoyment: 7Personally, I did quite enjoy myself while watching this anime.

It is a bad series that I can not honestly recommend to anyone. For starters, the pacing was poor, with some sections proceeding at breakneck speeds, while others dragged. This is not one of the most glaring flaws, but is still present. The main flaw in this series stems from the poor writing. Characters develop seemingly randomly, motivations are shaky at best, and the resolutions at the end of each arc were unsatisfying at best. The poor writing means that the dialogue between characters is not just...confusing, but often times nonsensical, and leaves viewers lost. The soundtrack is also an issue in Akuma no Riddle, because the score seems to just play whatever at any given point in time. The music almost never fits the scenes, often times giving off mixed feelings, like being tense in a situation where nothing is actually happening, or going to happen. The final, fatal flaw in this series is the conclusion, which not only fails to wrap up the story, but instead leaves the viewer in shock. Nothing happens, and nothing is achieved. In conclusion, if you're looking for a poorly written action series featuring homosexual women, you've found your series, however if you're looking for a decent story with fleshed out characters, and a plot that is well-defined, you won't find it here. confusing, but often times nonsensical, and leaves viewers lost.

I've seen it compared to the Dangan Ronpa anime in this respect, but I feel that the Dangan Ronpa anime was a little more enjoyable....The anime appears to have a yuri setting, but other than gratuitous panty shots, bondage and bath scenes, there seems to be very little actual romance - probably because there is literally not enough time for it.The ending leaves you unsatisfied and wondering what the hell I spent the past 12 weeks watching this for.

I want to showcase this one only because it may feature one of the greatest anime-episodes of all time.[insert kanye-meme here]No joke, I\'m actually serious about that statement.Now, that we\'ve got that out of the way, I want to recommend this series to anyone who\'s into Battly Royale\'ish survival game-settings, girls-with-guns and/or anything yuri-related, who doesn\'t have amazingly high expectations and just want to consume a nice, little survival game thriller. You\'ll be pleased, at the very least.Akuma no Riddle (otherwise known by its hilariously Engrish alternate title Riddle Story...of Devil) has kind of a slow-ass pacing up until a certain point. While it maintains a slow speed in terms of storytelling in the first and second third, it is in a constant struggle with itself to keep things interesting and suspenseful on one hand and, on the other hand, to show off some (admittedly sometimes quite competently made) short-burst action sequences and fanservice. It does both with rather varying degrees of success, unfortunately.The problem is not the overall artistry of the series - I dig the character designs and the colorful presentation. The animation quality varies between ""alright"" and ""lots of stillframes"" with the occasional well-animated and -orchestrated action sequence. It\'s slightly above average in that department. The kickass OP and some of the EDs are nice to listen to, the seiyuus do a really good job at delivering their lines with just the right amount of cheese (especially Yuka Ootsuba is freakin\' fantastic as Banba) and the overall OST is not an insult to the ears. So, all in all, AnR\'s art works well with what it\'s got.The big problem I had with the series was its lack of focus, even though the plot is simple enough: The headmaster of Myoujou Academy has a bunch of girls assigned to the ""Black Class"". Their assignment is to kill Haru - a.k.a. Redhead McNicegirl - in order to graduate and become a professional killer. The only one of the ""Black Class"" who doesn\'t want to murder her dead is fellow classmate Tokaku - a.k.a. Bluehair McHardass. Instead, she makes it her mission to protect the target from the rest of the chicks, who take turns in trying to kill Redhair.Each classmate gets her own episode devoted to her respective backstory and her motivation to become a badass assassin/to assassinate the shit out of Redhair, which is a nice idea in and of itself. But as said above, it hurts the pacing of the show in the long run. It starts to pick up, however, in the most glorious way possible.The word ""payoff"" gets thrown around a lot when people talk about how a certain anime episode delivered a nice payoff - but holy sandals of Moses, the tenth episode of this series is completely worth the wait. It turns an otherwise fairly average yuri thriller show into a fucking rollercoaster ride of fun and awesome for twenty minutes.

Last year it was adapted into a twelve episode anime series by Diomedéa, the same studio behind Ika Musume and some series I've never seen and know basically nothing about. This is my second exposure to their work. Let's see how they do.Story:Azuma Tokaku is an assassin in training. She gets selected for a rather strange mission at Myoujou Academy, a girls' school. She and twelve other girls will make up the school's Black Class and all of them except one, Ichinose Haru, are assassins. The assassin to slay...Haru will be rewarded with whatever they desire. Things shift when Tokaku develops feelings for Haru, vowing to protect her from the others even if it costs her her life.Let's start by looking at the issues with the narrative. There's really only one major complaint I have. The ending is pretty weak. There are parts of it that work but it tries way too hard to wrap everything up nicely and there are some things that really don't add up as a result. I can't really go into more details without giving major spoilers but if you've seen the anime you know exactly what I'm talking about. I will also say that the pacing isn't very good and the series quickly falls into a rhythm of having an assassin make an attempt on Haru's life every episode resulting in a match between her and Tokaku. I will give the series credit for being able to pull this off without it getting really samey and it's kind of understandable since the series has the same number of episodes as assassins, but it still leads to a sense that things are getting rushed.On a more positive note, the concept is compelling and it does keep you invested. The tension is really strong and there are a lot of really good sources for it be they mysteries about a character's past, a situation with one of the assassins that's particularly perilous or mysteries surrounding the scenario itself. I also like that Haru isn't a helpless damsel who can't do anything without Tokaku. She proves herself capable on several occasions and she even saves Tokaku a few times. The romance is also nicely done. It starts off kind of abruptly, but it gets a lot of good moments including a buddy breathing scene that's on par with Due South's, and it does develop into something really good. The series also has a really tragic episode about halfway through and it's very well done and handled.Characters:The cast is surprisingly strong. For a series with more major characters than episodes they do manage to give them all back stories, motivations and make them pretty well fleshed out. There are certainly characters who are better developed than others, but they do do really well overall. That isn't to say it's perfect. There are some issues with it. They use the pop culture version of dissociative identity disorder. There's also a part of Isuke's background that bothers me. She has two dads, no that isn't what bothers me, and calls one of them “Mama.” I'm relatively certain that most gay couples do not have their adopted children refer to one of them by an opposite gender term and that that detail was just put in to make their family more “traditional.” In fact, most gay couples just differentiate by using different terms like “daddy” and “papa” or “dad” and “father” or “papa” and “vati.”Art:There are a lot of good aspects to the art. The character designs, mostly, are well done. Although I still have no idea why that one girl looks like a grade schooler. The action scenes are really well done with a lot of intensity. There are a lot of nicely done background details too. On the downside, the series is overly fond of fan-serviceSound:Our leads are voiced by Suwa Ayaka and Kanemoto Hisako (the voice of Ika Musume). They both give solid performances. We also get great performances from Nanjo Yoshino (Canaan's Maria), Misawa Sachika (Kitakubu Katsudou Kiroku's Reina), Uchida Mami and Yamada Yuki. Really, there aren't any badly done performances in this. The music is also really good. Interestingly enough, the ending themes change from episode to episode and all the major actresses get to perform either by themselves or as part of a duet and they're all really good.Ho-yay:While this is a yuri series, the romance elements are a bit downplayed. About the most you get is going to be a hug here and there. Still, the relationship between Tokaku and Haru is really well done and there is some extra yuri on the side between Chitaru and Hitsugi. There's also the fact that Isuke has two dads but we never really see them together. So, the ho-yay factor is a 7/10. Don't come into this expecting a lot of snogging and romantic scenes.Final Thoughts:Akuma no Riddle is an interesting series with some really good moments, intense action scenes, compelling characters and an intriguing plot. It's not perfect by any means and there are some head scratching decisions in it, but I still suggest checking it out since there are so many more things that it does well. My final rating for it is going to be an 8/10. Next week I'll look at Sengoku Otome : Momoiro Paradox. Haru will be rewarded with whatever they desire. Things shift when Tokaku develops feelings for Haru, vowing to protect her from the others even if it costs her her life.Let's start by looking at the issues with the narrative. There's really only one major complaint I have. The ending is pretty weak. There are parts of it that work but it tries way too hard to wrap everything up nicely and there are some things that really don't add up as a result. I can't really go into more details without giving major spoilers but if you've seen the anime you know exactly what I'm talking about. I will also say that the pacing isn't very good and the series quickly falls into a rhythm of having an assassin make an attempt on Haru's life every episode resulting in a match between her and Tokaku. I will give the series credit for being able to pull this off without it getting really samey and it's kind of understandable since the series has the same number of episodes as assassins, but it still leads to a sense that things are getting rushed.On a more positive note, the concept is compelling and it does keep you invested. The tension is really strong and there are a lot of really good sources for it be they mysteries about a character's past, a situation with one of the assassins that's particularly perilous or mysteries surrounding the scenario itself. I also like that Haru isn't a helpless damsel who can't do anything without Tokaku. She proves herself capable on several occasions and she even saves Tokaku a few times. The romance is also nicely done. It starts off kind of abruptly, but it gets a lot of good moments including a buddy breathing scene that's on par with Due South's, and it does develop into something really good. The series also has a really tragic episode about halfway through and it's very well done and handled.Characters:The cast is surprisingly strong. For a series with more major characters than episodes they do manage to give them all back stories, motivations and make them pretty well fleshed out. There are certainly characters who are better developed than others, but they do do really well overall. That isn't to say it's perfect. There are some issues with it. They use the pop culture version of dissociative identity disorder. There's also a part of Isuke's background that bothers me. She has two dads, no that isn't what bothers me, and calls one of them “Mama.” I'm relatively certain that most gay couples do not have their adopted children refer to one of them by an opposite gender term and that that detail was just put in to make their family more “traditional.” In fact, most gay couples just differentiate by using different terms like “daddy” and “papa” or “dad” and “father” or “papa” and “vati.”Art:There are a lot of good aspects to the art. The character designs, mostly, are well done. Although I still have no idea why that one girl looks like a grade schooler. The action scenes are really well done with a lot of intensity. There are a lot of nicely done background details too. On the downside, the series is overly fond of fan-serviceSound:Our leads are voiced by Suwa Ayaka and Kanemoto Hisako (the voice of Ika Musume). They both give solid performances. We also get great performances from Nanjo Yoshino (Canaan's Maria), Misawa Sachika (Kitakubu Katsudou Kiroku's Reina), Uchida Mami and Yamada Yuki. Really, there aren't any badly done performances in this. The music is also really good. Interestingly enough, the ending themes change from episode to episode and all the major actresses get to perform either by themselves or as part of a duet and they're all really good.Ho-yay:While this is a yuri series, the romance elements are a bit downplayed.

But for you to know – you should watch this BEFORE Danganronpa and stuff.', 'I\'m going to try to go into detail about this anime without spoiling much. I also put this too long didn\'t read summary below just in case you do not want to read the longish review.tl:dr - Akuma no Riddle has some interesting elements and a large character cast, but due to only having 12 episodes, characters are underdeveloped and the ""yuri"" theme doesn\'t really rub on until the end of the anime. The ending is very dreadful and feels like a kick to the groin.I originally was inspired to watch this due to DemolitionD\'s video about the spring season. I was slightly excited to...watch this anime due to it being my first ""yuri"" action themed anime. I started about two week\'s late when it aired and continued to watch it. Slowly as each week passed by my interest for this anime grew so weary that I\'m amazed I did not drop this series. Story wise, this anime is about a special class known as ""Class Black"" that has 13 students. 12 of these students are trained assassins which their goal is the kill the non-assassin student and main protagonist Haru Ichinose. If one of the assassin kills Haru, they will be granted one wish of their desire.Tokaku Azuma, who happens to be room mates with Haru, forms liking for Haru and decides to protect her. Thus this story takes off.The theme for the story is interesting but this anime shares similar problems with Danganronpa. To keep it short, Danganronpa also had a nice theme but due to only having 13 episodes, the development for its anime counterpart(this is a video game if your interested) is weak and rushed. Back to Akuma no Riddle, the assassins who target Haru(and sometimes ones not involved) only get 1 episode to showcase their background and wish. This makes characters who\'s personalities have not blossomed yet, seem irrelevant. You care for the character only for that episode and as 1 or 2 more pass by you may forget them or simply not care about them anymore. For those assassins that happen to last longer, in my opinion, they do not rub off well as likeable. A huge thing to complain about this development is Haru and Tokaku. After the first 2 to 4 episodes you pretty much understand them. There is no real development for them and if you choose to skip ahead you would truly only miss the weekly assassins back story. Haru is a gullible character, aware of being targeted by many assassins she tries to make the best out of her experience. People who watched this anime complain about her being useless(reddit comments) which I agree and slightly disagree. At least compared to other female characters claimed ""useless"" Haru will not sit back and watch much, she has her moments where she puts up a decent fight. Tokaku is another story also if it was not for Tokaku\'s slightly noticeable chest, then I would confuse her for being a man. Tokaku is the simple over protective character that focuses on her task at hand a majority of the time. Tokaku is simple a boring character to follow, if it was not for the action scenes I would\'ve probably stop caring about her and Haru. There are some other elements in the story that ""grind my gears"" but ill just end it right here.The art for this anime is where it blossoms as intriguing. The backgrounds, effects, and other visuals are beautiful and is one of the elements that will keep you watching. The animation is alright. When the action scene\'s occur the animation can be great but it is nothing special and at some moments during action scene\'s, the animation can look choppy. Character designs are nice as well.The music is not much to brag about...just kidding. The music is pretty good, It fits the scenes perfectly, whether its a serious or casual moment the music fits it well. A unique thing(that also gives more props to the animation) is the endings. Each ending is sung by a voice actor, usually the weekly assassin and the animation for the ending reflects the characters personality. It is enjoyable and another element that shines in this anime.The ending is something that I really despise. In a way it decently wraps up the story but....If I continued I would be posting major spoilers just check it out for yourself, It gave me a good 5 minute head shake. It beats the ""established seriousness"" out of this series in my opinion. It also made me demote this anime from a 6/10 to a 5/10.The anime can be enjoyable here and there but it wasn\'t something I was hyped waiting each weak for. Being fully offensive to this anime, I purposly watch this first so to hype myself up for Hitsugi no Chaika and Ping Pong the Animation.

This show had potential, the idea wasn't original and the characters were all a bit cliche but it had potential and I decided to give it a chance.  That said the beginning of this series was quite good actually with one episode near the middle of the series being a personal highlight for me.It was good and I liked it enough to continue.And this is where things change. The show just nose dives and loses any charm it had and without spoiling anything it became...a tiny bit stupid. I mean they're assassins and while everyone is trying to kill Haru it seems like just don't know how to kill a person.. They are supposed to be trained assassins but they just don't act like it.Also the ending, well, to put it bluntly, it's terrible. If you told me they could destroy the show in two episodes I wouldn't have believed you, but that's what they've done.To summarize my feelings on this, the beginning was good, the characters were bland and the ending seemed rushed and kinda stupid. That's harsh I know, but I really didn't enjoy the second half of this show.Spare yourself some time and watch something else.Also those watching this for the possible Yuri classification, you will be disappointed.

However, it turns out to be another generic action anime with no suspense.STORY (2):The story takes place in Myoujou Academy where 13 students are enrolled there. There is one student who is not an assassin and that person is Haru Ichinose. Tokaku Azuma is an assassin who develops feelings for her and is willing to protect her from the assassins.The hunter: 11 assassinsThe bodyguard: Tokaku AzumaThe hunted: Haru IchinoseThe story has some decent action scenes but not those high-octane ones....The first 3 scenes are decent but the rest are not. This story tries to cramp every characters back story into 13 episodes and most of them are incoherent and I didn't care for them. One example was in episode 6 about Chitaru's  & Hitsugi's back story.ART (2):The animation is dull. They make use of dim colors to set the mood for seriousness. However, the usage of dim colors works against the anime advantage, making it not engaging.SOUND (3):The PV is decent. I loved the tone of the music, it gives like a mysterious tone. The opening and ending is all right. The ending song has different songs sung by each of the seiyuus.CHARACTER (1):The characters are just generic and paper-thin. All they are here for is to get their asses handed over to Tokaku Azuma.Tokaku Azuma was the only decent character in this anime, but as the series progresses, her character starts to deteriorate until the final episode when she makes her wish.Haru Ichinose was so annoying to the point I wanted to choke her until she dies. Her character serves no point and all she do was being naive and easily trust people even though they are about to kill her. All she does was make every situation worse, even for Tokaku Azuma.Otoya Takechi has a cheerful personality and she reminds me of Hibiki Ganaha from Idolmaster. Both characters are voiced by Manami Numakura. Not only that Otoya attacks using scissors which Genocyder Syo from Danganronpa did.At least Otoya Takechi was a memorable assassin, the rest are just not worth talking about.CONCLUSION (2):The characters are generic and paper-thin.  I have such high hopes for this anime but it let me down in every aspect with the characters and their incoherent back stories. There were some decent fights but they weren't enough to save the show. And the ENDING. This ending is the worst ending I have ever witnessed. The ending is worse than any ending I have ever witnessed. Worse than Btooom, End of Evangelion & Coppelion.I already didn't care about the characters and the ending came and slap me right into the face. The ending just shows everyone all right. All that development was completely scrapped by the ending.*screaming and crying*Sorry about that, I just couldn't control my emotions. Overall, the only decent characters are Otoya & Azuma.

This is totally for me."" A few weeks pass by and not much has happened in that show yet, but you\'re still fine because the good part has to be coming up soon. Then, by the end of the season, you\'re left only with the feeling that you\'ve somehow been swindled out of five hours of your life by a promise that was not kept, and that...is where we begin today...Thirteen students at Myōjō Academy, a private boarding school for girls, have recently joined what is known as ""10th Year Class Black."" However, the situation is a bit different from your ordinary classroom. In Class Black, twelve of the students are expertly-trained assassins, and the thirteenth is the target. If one of the assassins manages to take out the target, they will be granted one wish from the benevolent benefactor of the school. Soon after the school year begins, Tokaku Azuma, an assassin from the infamous Azuma clan, discovers that the target is Haru Ichinose, a rather friendly member of the class. However, instead of assassinating her, Tokaku ends up developing feelings for Haru and swear to protect her from the rest of the class.So, let\'s recap what would most likely draw people to this series in the first place: 1. Assassins, and 2. Yuri (Girl Love). Starting with the first point, one would think that, for a show with eleven different assassins going after the same person, the ways in which someone is killed would be rather creative, and for the most part that would have been true. The different techniques and weapons used by each assassin, from deadly poison to straight-up smashing people with giant hammers, was an interesting facet of the show. Now, you might have noticed that I prepared that last statement with the phrase ""would have,"" and that\'s because this series makes a mistake so unbelievably unforgivable that it made me question whether or not the writers even knew what as assassin was. That\'s right: no one died, and many of them, after failing to kill Haru, sort of just walk off in shame and aren\'t seen again til the epilogue. I really hate to start with such a huge spoiler so early, but...why?! They\'re assassins!The worst part was that, until the last five minutes or so, it looked like we did have a few deaths, with two of them that happened at the same time making up what I considered to be the emotional climax of the show (at the halfway point of the series mind you); but then the decided at the end to go ""Oh yeah everyone\'s still alive by the way."" The people who were stabbed in the chest, drank highly-potent poison, and were crushed under falling theater lighting were all A-OK. When someone says ""assassin,"" you don\'t think ""person who subdues their target in the most over-the-top way possible without actually killing them."" It\'s like how Naruto has been woefully abusing the word ""ninja"" for the past decade.So, the assassin part is officially belly-up, which leaves us with the yuri. The popularity of yuri in anime has been growing steadily over the past few years, but there hasn\'t really be a ""be-all end-all"" title to represent the genre. Does Akuma no Riddle fit the bill? Absolutely not. While they say that Tokaku has fallen for Haru, they never really show any chemistry between them. I\'m pretty sure Tokaku spends more time deflecting attacks from the other assassins than she does actually having a conversation with Haru.There\'s also a very huge discrepancy with the ""yuri"" label that needs to be addressed. Were we in Japan, I would not have addressed this at all; but as a westerner using western sites to look up anime, it\'s extremely discouraging to see some sites not understand the difference between yuri and shoujo-ai. To put it briefly, yuri covers relationships of a more sexual nature (kissing, sex, etc.), while shoujo-ai covers the more intimate and emotional aspects of the relationship without being more explicit. So, at best, Akuma no Riddle barely makes the cut for shoujo-ai, but doesn\'t even come close to breaking into yuri territory. Thankfully, I have seen some sites backtrack on their labels and switch it to shoujo-ai, but that initial mistake was still an upsetting one.Character development for this was an absolute mess as well. I will admit that we do get some details and developments on Tokaku and Haru and how the class is affecting them, and I did care a little bit about them by the end of the series. However, the other eleven were practically throw away characters. I can\'t even remember most of their names as I\'m typing this because they left so little of an impression on me. The only ones I actually cared about were Hitsugi and Chitaru, as they had the most spectacular ""deaths"" out of everyone and also managed to have better yuri moments that Tokaku and Haru.The animation was done by Diomedéa, also responsible for Noucome and Mondaiji, and this is the only aspect of this series that stood out for positive reasons. The fight sequences were exceptionally well-choreographed and well-animated, though the environments tended to default to a drab gray color sometimes. They also had the good sense to make the character designs extremely diverse, as making any of these characters too similar would have led me to be extremely confused, on account of how little characterization they gave to everyone. My only complaint is that the fan service wasn\'t really all that interesting, and, to be honest, it kind of turned me off sometimes.There is currently no dub, but, as this show rests with FUNimation, a dub would probably be an improvement on this show. I\'m not sure how popular this show really is though, so the assurance of a dub actually coming out is still up in the air.The music was composed by Yoshiaki Fujisawa, who also composed for Love Live! and Rail Wars. In keeping with what seems to be the theme recently, Fujisawa makes very heavy use of intense electronic music to set each scene on edge and to hype up fight sequences. It\'s a shame that ""Sōshō Innocence"" by Maaya Uchida had to be attached to this show, as it was hands-down my favorite opening theme from this season, with its heavy driving rock sound getting me excessively pumped to watch each episode. Additionally, each episode had a different ending theme, with my personal favorites being for episodes 5 and 10-12.In the end, Akuma no Riddle was nothing more than a total betrayal of my expectations. The assassins didn\'t kill anyone, there was barely any yuri, and no amount of epic fight scenes could forgive that.I give Akuma no Riddle\ufeff a 5/10 and recommend that you skip this series. However, if you are still interested in watching it, the series is currently licensed by FUNimation and it available for streaming from their site.For alternate recommendations, I point you towards a murder/mystery series also set in a classroom: \ufeffDanganronpa the Animation\ufeff; and for an alternate take on a battle royale-esque scenario with one contestant defending another, we once again come to \ufeffThe Future Diary\ufeff. is where we begin today...Thirteen students at Myōjō Academy, a private boarding school for girls, have recently joined what is known as ""10th Year Class Black."" However, the situation is a bit different from your ordinary classroom. In Class Black, twelve of the students are expertly-trained assassins, and the thirteenth is the target. If one of the assassins manages to take out the target, they will be granted one wish from the benevolent benefactor of the school. Soon after the school year begins, Tokaku Azuma, an assassin from the infamous Azuma clan, discovers that the target is Haru Ichinose, a rather friendly member of the class. However, instead of assassinating her, Tokaku ends up developing feelings for Haru and swear to protect her from the rest of the class.So, let\'s recap what would most likely draw people to this series in the first place: 1. Assassins, and 2. Yuri (Girl Love). Starting with the first point, one would think that, for a show with eleven different assassins going after the same person, the ways in which someone is killed would be rather creative, and for the most part that would have been true. The different techniques and weapons used by each assassin, from deadly poison to straight-up smashing people with giant hammers, was an interesting facet of the show. Now, you might have noticed that I prepared that last statement with the phrase ""would have,"" and that\'s because this series makes a mistake so unbelievably unforgivable that it made me question whether or not the writers even knew what as assassin was. That\'s right: no one died, and many of them, after failing to kill Haru, sort of just walk off in shame and aren\'t seen again til the epilogue. I really hate to start with such a huge spoiler so early, but...why?! They\'re assassins!The worst part was that, until the last five minutes or so, it looked like we did have a few deaths, with two of them that happened at the same time making up what I considered to be the emotional climax of the show (at the halfway point of the series mind you); but then the decided at the end to go ""Oh yeah everyone\'s still alive by the way."" The people who were stabbed in the chest, drank highly-potent poison, and were crushed under falling theater lighting were all A-OK. When someone says ""assassin,"" you don\'t think ""person who subdues their target in the most over-the-top way possible without actually killing them."" It\'s like how Naruto has been woefully abusing the word ""ninja"" for the past decade.So, the assassin part is officially belly-up, which leaves us with the yuri. The popularity of yuri in anime has been growing steadily over the past few years, but there hasn\'t really be a ""be-all end-all"" title to represent the genre. Does Akuma no Riddle fit the bill? Absolutely not. While they say that Tokaku has fallen for Haru, they never really show any chemistry between them. I\'m pretty sure Tokaku spends more time deflecting attacks from the other assassins than she does actually having a conversation with Haru.There\'s also a very huge discrepancy with the ""yuri"" label that needs to be addressed. Were we in Japan, I would not have addressed this at all; but as a westerner using western sites to look up anime, it\'s extremely discouraging to see some sites not understand the difference between yuri and shoujo-ai. To put it briefly, yuri covers relationships of a more sexual nature (kissing, sex, etc.), while shoujo-ai covers the more intimate and emotional aspects of the relationship without being more explicit. So, at best, Akuma no Riddle barely makes the cut for shoujo-ai, but doesn\'t even come close to breaking into yuri territory. Thankfully, I have seen some sites backtrack on their labels and switch it to shoujo-ai, but that initial mistake was still an upsetting one.Character development for this was an absolute mess as well. I will admit that we do get some details and developments on Tokaku and Haru and how the class is affecting them, and I did care a little bit about them by the end of the series. However, the other eleven were practically throw away characters. I can\'t even remember most of their names as I\'m typing this because they left so little of an impression on me. The only ones I actually cared about were Hitsugi and Chitaru, as they had the most spectacular ""deaths"" out of everyone and also managed to have better yuri moments that Tokaku and Haru.The animation was done by Diomedéa, also responsible for Noucome and Mondaiji, and this is the only aspect of this series that stood out for positive reasons. The fight sequences were exceptionally well-choreographed and well-animated, though the environments tended to default to a drab gray color sometimes. They also had the good sense to make the character designs extremely diverse, as making any of these characters too similar would have led me to be extremely confused, on account of how little characterization they gave to everyone. My only complaint is that the fan service wasn\'t really all that interesting, and, to be honest, it kind of turned me off sometimes.There is currently no dub, but, as this show rests with FUNimation, a dub would probably be an improvement on this show. I\'m not sure how popular this show really is though, so the assurance of a dub actually coming out is still up in the air.The music was composed by Yoshiaki Fujisawa, who also composed for Love Live! and Rail Wars. In keeping with what seems to be the theme recently, Fujisawa makes very heavy use of intense electronic music to set each scene on edge and to hype up fight sequences.

As part of her training, she is sent to an all-girls boarding school, where she and 12 other female assassins are told that they must figure out which of them is their target, and the first to eliminate the target will be granted opportunities...beyond their wildest dreams. Azuma finds herself falling in love with her room mate, Ichise Haru, who she believes to be the target. The assassins face inner turmoil as they try to figure out who it is they have to kill, facing crises of morality, wondering what the purpose and value of their lives really is and what it really means to take someone else\'s life. Azuma grapples with her indifference towards both winning and dying, but slowly finds purpose in protecting Ichise. At the end, all is revealed -  the catch is, nobody is a target. In fact, the last assassin to survive will be the winner. In the very end, when only Ichise and Azuma are left, they are forced to realize why they had to endure the trauma of the last few months, decide what to do from then on, whether they can defy the powers that be and rebuild their lives after the considerable trauma they faced during their time at the academy.That is a tale of what might have been. Of course, this is not an original plotline. It has been done before. Yet rewatching the same recycled messages about what it means to be alive and what it means to love would still have been preferable to watching what actually occurred in Akuma no Riddle.Story: 2/10 | Characters: 1/10In a nutshell, this is what happens: generic emotionless character meets generic cinnamon roll character and tries to protect her from generic violent characters that, although of varying backgrounds using different methods, are all pretty much the same. Apparently, if they eliminate the target, they will get whatever they wish for, which is why they\'re eager to get her blood on their hands. From the very beginning, everyone knows who the target is (and yes, she\'s a target, not an assassin, who has supposedly been victimized her whole life). Emotionless character supposedly starts to develop feelings for cinnamon roll character based on how different cinnamon roll character is from her, but this is never really portrayed in a realistic, believable, or even upfront way. We don\'t even really know why, but emotionless character vows to protect cinnamon roll character at all costs. One could argue that it\'s because emotionless character needs motivation to keep living/something to love etc., or that it was because of the plot twist, and these things might have worked had emotionless character\'s backstory actually been shown in more detail and a way that was at all realistic, and/or if the plot twist had made any fucking sense. In fact, the most believable reason for why Azuma protects Haru is probably that she had nothing better to do because she didn\'t care about either winning or losing. Emotionless character defends cinnamon roll from all the violent characters. We don\'t learn anything new from any of the characters apart from what their backstories are when they\'re chucked at us all in one go - nothing deeper. At the very end, it\'s discovered that (hold your breath) this game wasn\'t a test for the assassins, but a test for the cinnamon roll, who apparently has a power passed down through all the women in her clan that she didn\'t even know about - the power to subconsciously manipulate others into protecting her - to see if she could survive living amongst 12 assassins by subconsciously manipulating one to protect her. ...what. It\'s like the story tried to be original but ended up just being fucking stupid.As for the ""riddle"" element of this story... I still have no idea what relevance the ""riddles"" even had to the story. Honestly, you could have taken the guy who texted the riddles to Azuma (I can\'t even remember what relevance he had to the plot, apart from being a part of the organization that sent Azuma to this school, which is a red flag considering he is made out to be important to the story - yet I still have no idea why) out of the picture completely and it wouldn\'t have made any difference at all. The only reason I can think of for why his idiotic ""riddles"" play a part is to make it seem as if there is profundity to the story, which there isn\'t, and the riddles never made me believe for a second that there was.The fact that all the assassins knew who their target was from the start instantly took away so much potential for coming to understand and get attached to all the characters. If they had had to figure it out on their own, we could have seen a realistic exposition of the characters\' identities in real time. It would really have made so much difference to the quality of the plot and the depth of the characters. That way, the characters could have been much more subtle and believable, and their motivations for killing Ichise/staying in the game wouldn\'t have had to be so ridiculous. Clearly thinking of a unique reason for each of the assassins to kill Ichise was pretty difficult, because the assassins\' motives were all much too out there to believable in the short period of time we\'re given to actually find out what they are. Had they just been better developed characters, the writers wouldn\'t have had to put such incredible and obvious effort into forcing the methods of the assassins to be so unique and fantastical.From the very beginning, it is very clear what every character is. They have all the depth of cardboard cutouts. Each and every one of them is exactly what they appear to be. I think I stuck through every episode of this incredibly disappointing anime hoping against hope that I would be able to see some dimension appear in the characters, but to no avail. Everyone was exactly what they seemed. Any mediocre attempts at making them appear, for a split second, to have any depth at all were a mirage.If this anime had focused on the experience of the collective rather than on one character per episode, it would have been a thousand times better. Every time someone new tries to kill Haru (before Azuma saves her ofc) it\'s like a stranger has come onto the screen to give you a speech about their past disappointments before attempting to end Ichise. I cannot even describe how idiotic and simplistic the supporting characters were. As for the protagonists, they were equally idiotic and simplistic. Azuma is basically a kuudere and nothing more. Ichise is an almost unrealistically optimistic cinnamon roll who could get her arms and legs cut off with a rusty spoon and still be smiling through the tears. Their relationship goes nowhere. That\'s all there really is to say about them.Art/Sound:No comment. It was fine. Nothing striking or spectacular in a good or bad way. Nothing you haven\'t seen or heard before.Enjoyment/Overall: 3/10I\'ll admit that I watched this entire series in less than a day, but that was mostly because I felt like the episodes added nothing to the development of the story and I was looking for a good place to stop from which I could pick it up again with interest. That point never came. I can see why it would appeal to some people - not everyone wants to be able to analyse the story or characters for their \'deeper meanings\' and that\'s okay - but even so, I couldn\'t even enjoy Akuma no Riddle much in that way. It also seemed to me like the writers were trying to give the characters and story depth but it just didn\'t happen. Akuma no Riddle wasn\'t horrifically unwatchable. It was just not enjoyable. beyond their wildest dreams. Azuma finds herself falling in love with her room mate, Ichise Haru, who she believes to be the target.

It was just not enjoyable.', ""(updated 9/19/18 to match format with other reviews, slight content revision)Hi! Welcome to another Robert's Too Late Reviews! As always, the synopsis is your friend, and there could be SPOILERS but I do try my very best to avoid/minimize them. Working the dubbed version. If you've seen some of my reviews, I can be a little forgiving, but alas, Akuma no Riddle doesn't leave much room for positive elements. There are surely more wasteful anime out there, but there are MANY more that towers over this in quality, so there are better uses of your time. Will this make the RTLR wall of fame? You...might be surprised!  Let's get into it.Story: 3The entire premise of a prestigious school recruiting a special class of assassins to just kill a single target, and then impose tons of rules on how the hit can go down is just ridiculous beyond words. It would have made more sense for the assassins to find the target on their own means and attempt to attack than to pool them together and say 'wait your turn now!' They're all supposed to be pro killers, why would they ever even bother with this setup? There are better ways to write in a killer facing down her target than what we're given. Worse still, one assassin who has never killed yet somehow made the cut for a class of super killers, decides to protect the target character with what i would call murky motivations at best. The story comes across as a half baked thought someone scribbled on a napkin then, without further refinement, just threw it together.Art: 7The art wasn't bad, the animation seemed to flow well from my perspective, though it was not anything to write home about. It was kind of middle of the road to slightly good side. Not much more to say on it.Sound: 7I dig the intro song, the rock style matches the theme of assassinations and action, so that's a positive, and in an interesting twist, each episode features a different ending song that is related to the assassin that was featured in that episode taking their turn to kill the target. Some of the songs are odd, but mostly they seemed to fit the assassin's they were written for. It was a nice touch and not something I've come across previously.Character: 5As I said, the main pacifist assassin doesn't really have a good reason to throw her lot in with the target, but does so anyway. The target is made to be somewhat mysterious in her background and such as an attempt to inflate the sagging story, but that fails as well. The target comes to a point where she admits she knows everyone's out to kill her, and is still cheery and ready for class each day. If I found out my entire class was only there to kill me, I think I'd play hookey for.....well forever!The assassins' themselves are a mixed bag, some are cool, others are just disappointing. Each killer uses a personalized weapon, say a knife or a sword, or bombs and poison. This anime does feature one of my favorite characters, a split personality killer who is mild mannered by day, and stark raving mad and in a murderous rage at night. I like crazy girls, what can I say? There's also a weird set of an obviously older assassin who watches over a much younger one. This one tips way too close to an inappropriate relationship for my tastes. There are a few redheads that are basically slight variations of each other, and the 'MC' of the killer competition is just straight up annoying.If not for Jamie Marchi's character (yes she's been in EVERYTHING but I'm a fan anyway) and the ultimately awesome hammer wielding Mahiru Banba, the assassin group would be a bore.Enjoyment: 4I was not expecting much because the basic plot is clearly too contrived, but I watched, hoping for some awesome assassin action. There are a few moments, but not enough to justify the amount of time invested to see them.As I came towards the end of the series, I could think of 3 or maybe even 4 twist endings they could use that would have just really made it so worth it, but again, what seems to be lazy or uninspired writing took the day and the show limped to the end. There are too much good anime to waste time on this one like I did. Strangely enough as much as I felt 'meh' about this anime, it ranked two pics on the wall, one purely for Banba (hammertime!) and one of the bodyguard and the target girl because I like romance, even when it's kinda limp.

I won\'t give you one, No! I\'ll give you 13 awesome girls in just one anime show. Yeah, you read good! (Just realized that this sounds like a TV...commercial). Akuma no Riddle or Riddle Story of Devil finished airing in 2014 and  in 12 episodes in total it really showed that girls don\'t only care about nails and clothes.Plot and Storyline:To be honest, this anime has a poor storyline. It\'s not stupid but there could have been done a better job. And it was like the makers were bored and just wanted it to end, resulting a kinda forced eniding with no sense.Still, I have to say that the action in this anime can hardly be compared to any other 12-episode anime. You have guns, swords, knifes, bombs and some very clever ways of killing. VIOLENCE INCLUDED so I wouldn\'t recommend watching with younger brothers and sisters.Everything starts with the beginning of the new school year at Myoujou Academy, a boarding school for girls. New girls, new assassin class, new target...Wait what?Yeah, it does look like an assassin game, I know. Well it kinda is. You have 13 girls in one class.Twelve of these girls are skilled and well trained killers and they all have one goal. Kill the target. This year it will be little Haru Ichinose. The only difference is that this year the target surprisingly gains a protector. Tokaku Azuma kinda falls in love with Ichinose and tries to protect her until the very end. When it comes to the end...What a surprise!Characters:You have 13 different girls. As excepted each of them has her own background story and a different way of assassinating Ichinose. That\'s the most interesting part of the show, the diversity.Ichinose: She is that typical naive, cute, little girl that is half of the time not aware of what\'s happening around her. She is the most innocent character in the show and I really felt sorry for her. And please don\'t judge her in the end. It\'s not her fault taht...(NO SPOILERS, THAT\'S THE RULE!).Azuma: What a girl! The skills of this woman really surpassed my expectations. Her moto as I understood: ""Speak less, do more"". She always kept calm, observed and then acted. A very interesting fighter. May I represent, Tokaku Azuma.Animation:The first thing I want to commend about this anime are definitely the looks of the characters. Nice work done by the director and designers.  What I personally found interesting is that the ending of each episode is different, every time sung by another voice actor. Nice idea, although I always skip the ending. Never-mind, Let\'s move on...Conclusion:A with action overloaded anime awesomely interesting anime despite his poor storyline. It is not a masterpiece but I still don\'t get the low ating of 6,84 on My Anime List. It probably lies in the as said before forced ending. A few episodes more would have made it way better.In short. If you love action and adrenaline and don\'t care about the quality of the story this would definitely be a anime for you.I liked it, I hope you\'ll too.Your AnimeGirl commercial).

You have 13 girls in one class.Twelve of these girls are skilled and well trained killers and they all have one goal. Kill the target. This year it will be little Haru Ichinose. The only difference is that this year the target surprisingly gains a protector. Tokaku Azuma kinda falls in love with Ichinose and tries to protect her until the very end. When it comes to the end...What a surprise!Characters:You have 13 different girls. As excepted each of them has her own background story and a different way of assassinating Ichinose. That\'s the most interesting part of the show, the diversity.Ichinose: She is that typical naive, cute, little girl that is half of the time not aware of what\'s happening around her. She is the most innocent character in the show and I really felt sorry for her. And please don\'t judge her in the end. It\'s not her fault taht...(NO SPOILERS, THAT\'S THE RULE!).Azuma: What a girl! The skills of this woman really surpassed my expectations. Her moto as I understood: ""Speak less, do more"". She always kept calm, observed and then acted. A very interesting fighter. May I represent, Tokaku Azuma.Animation:The first thing I want to commend about this anime are definitely the looks of the characters. Nice work done by the director and designers.  What I personally found interesting is that the ending of each episode is different, every time sung by another voice actor. Nice idea, although I always skip the ending. Never-mind, Let\'s move on...Conclusion:A with action overloaded anime awesomely interesting anime despite his poor storyline. It is not a masterpiece but I still don\'t get the low ating of 6,84 on My Anime List. It probably lies in the as said before forced ending. A few episodes more would have made it way better.In short. If you love action and adrenaline and don\'t care about the quality of the story this would definitely be a anime for you.I liked it, I hope you\'ll too.Your AnimeGirl', 'I really enjoyed this anime.  Here I will list why.Character design:A lot less ecchi than most.  Doesn\'t start off with panty shots and silly ""I\'M SO KAWAII"" things.It\'s really serious in atmosphere.  I\'m not sure how empathetic of an audience you guys are, but let me try to explain it in my own words.Character design:  Variety in character designs.  Variety in personalities.  Variety in objectives, past, etc.  Colorful, easy to distinguish hair styles.Of course after a while, things tend to look the same in anime.  Characters tend to show themselves in other animes with different names....Cliche isn\'t always a bad thing.  Here in this anime, the designs are decent.I can always appreciate good use of tattoos, scars, and color.  I can rate it a 8.  On another note, I think the fact the girls aren\'t super sexualized and have actual proficiency in their talents make them even more valuable gems.  Let me try and ask a question to the audience.Do you want a girlfriend/friend that has passion and talent, or would you rather have a girlfriend/friend that\'s proficient in plotless pantyshots?It\'s fine if you want the latter one.  I just personally don\'t like dimwitted child girls with filling in precious plot with their plump, blushing vag-shots--thank you very much.  I find all of these characters to be interesting to be around if they were real.  I\'d totally hang around with them, you know?  Whereas if the typical, generic anime girl were around me--whether it\'s tsundere, yandere, dandere, kuudere, etc---I\'d either be embarassed, annoyed, or just bored out of mind to be around them.  I hope that makes sense---I tried.Plot design(trying to be blunt without spoilers):  Do you ever wonder if anime is too boring because ""You saw it coming?""Do you EVER ask yourself if it was intended by the producer to allow you to see the future climax?  Yeah, well--it\'s called foreshadowing.  If you think this anime is boring because you\'re smart sh*t, you\'re better off watching random shenanigans like Nichijou and FLCL.  -shrugs-I do enjoy the plot twists here and there.  I can explain why--even if I do see it coming.Do you ever get that feeling you want something to be a certain way?This anime gives you to you, takes it away, then gives it to you again.  Why?Because you get false hope.  It\'s fun.  You ought to try it.The plot is decent.  It\'s a good story.  I\'m sick of people rating it by \'originality\'Do you ever see people that like weird, non-mainstream anime because it\'s rare and different?  Like--people who can\'t like Akame Ga Kill or Cowboy Bebop just because they have their panties in a knot trying to figure out whether they\'re non-conformist?  Just think of it this way--Everything has a formula just like in math--just like a recipe.Mainstream:Hey, let\'s make a cake today!  We\'re going to use eggs, milk, sugar, and flour--we\'ll add some yummy fruit too!Non-mainstream fanbase: WE\'RE MAKING ANCHOVY CAKE WITH PEANUTS AND FRUIT PUNCH.  SO COOLLLL. WAO.Basically, I can give this anime a higher rating for a plot because of that.  -shrugs-Another note: Lesbians that have personality and coolness---and they don\'t all have C and D-cups.  I\'m impressed by variety--personally.  I dig variety more than anything.  = w=Art: AAAAAH.  The lighting changes, the atmosphere coloration--the hair--the detailing---the shading--10/10.  It\'s hard to make extremely nice lines and accurate animations in well---animation.  Do you ever ask yourself how hard it is to animate?  It\'s tedious.  Animating is a job that chunks your life away.  So I have to rate it 10/10--not to compare to anything else--just as an anime by itself--you know?Sound:  I wish there were more songs showing different emotions for different scenes--like---for sad scenes, fight scenes, super happy scenes.  I love the voice actors to death though.  Just--the variety.  I mean to say that---the girls have different voices---they aren\'t all moe and high pitched pterodactyls.  I love it.  I loved it so much I\'m ready to die.  Just kill me now.  *o* 9.5/10Enjoyment:  I cried.  I don\'t care if it\'s cliche.  I liked it.  10/10.  I enjoyed the type of cliche.  I enjoyed the tension.  I enjoyed the happy moments.  I like the humor in it but I can\'t quite understand myself if I SHOULD be laughing most of the time--grim humor, you know?Story:8/10.  It\'s not the cliche that matters---I say once again.  Everything else applied well.  I would give it 5/10 or less if I didn\'t like it, but since I did, I give it an 8.Overall: 10/10 Cliche isn\'t always a bad thing.

While no masterpiece, Akuma no Riddle provides enough entertainment for you to keep watching, all with badass girls who do the badass things.There really isn\'t much in the way of story here. Haru, a girl born into a clan, is being hunted by 12 other students, who each have their own reasons for wanting her dead. The characters themselves have no real depth to them, nor do they have any real growth. The only characters you could argue experience growth are Tokaku and Haru....This show really isn\'t deserving of its ""Shoujo Ai"" tag, either. If you were looking for Yuri, you probably want to search elsewhere.The story is marginally episodic, with each episode focusing on one particular assassin. The series lends itself to predictability and you\'ll soon learn that the episodes pretty much go as follows: Assassin sends in their card, Haru is in danger, the girls do the fighting, Haru and Tokaku win while the assassin learns something about themselves and is expelled from the Class Black program. The romantic subplot in this anime is almost non-existent. It\'s obvious that Tokaku\'s reasons behind wanting to protect Haru stems from sexual attraction, yet the show never really explicitly says it outright, rather resorting to the more generic term of ""wanting to protect someone precious to them"". Imagine the romantic subplot as a jar on a high shelf. Now imagine reaching for it, where you can *almost* reach it but its just that bit too far. That\'s the romantic subplot in a nutshell. It\'s almost there, but its never explicitly referred to nor is it explored in any fashion.The animation is good and the art style is aesthetically pleasing. Non-important characters such as b.g characters are portrayed as black and white, providing an interesting contrast from the main characters. The music is good, invoking the right emotions at the right times.Akuma no Riddle definitely isn\'t for everyone, as shown by its relatively average score. However, I enjoyed it and had a fun time. If there was ever a reason to ever come back for a second season, which is unlikely, you can bet your buns that I\'ll be the first one there to be watching it.

But aside from that the story is okay a bit too predicable apart from the ending which is really confusing without spoiling anything.Art: 8Now the art was pretty nice it was colourful as well as dark which fits the tone of the show but man those eyes the characters had were something else it...feels like they were staring into my soul they were that good and certainly have an assassins look to them such as with Tokaku and Nio.Sound: 10The main OST in the show was pretty average nothing mind blowing, but the opening was one of the best of spring 2014 in my opinion so that I never skipped it through all 12 episodes and now for the endings there is a different one for every episodes that each represent a different character and its pulled of really well and there all good to listen to.Characters: 7The characters were good in appearance and personality as they varied and all had their distinct style to killing which made each episode feel refreshing but they lacked development in any way which made them less interesting than watching paint dry without spoiling anything save for Tokaku who does develop over the course of the story.Enjoyment: 7The show was good but lacked something to make me want the next week to come faster as well as really predictable story but had a lovely art style which is my second favourite so far. feels like they were staring into my soul they were that good and certainly have an assassins look to them such as with Tokaku and Nio.Sound: 10The main OST in the show was pretty average nothing mind blowing, but the opening was one of the best of spring 2014 in my opinion so that I never skipped it through all 12 episodes and now for the endings there is a different one for every episodes that each represent a different character and its pulled of really well and there all good to listen to.Characters: 7The characters were good in appearance and personality as they varied and all had their distinct style to killing which made each episode feel refreshing but they lacked development in any way which made them less interesting than watching paint dry without spoiling anything save for Tokaku who does develop over the course of the story.Enjoyment: 7The show was good but lacked something to make me want the next week to come faster as well as really predictable story but had a lovely art style which is my second favourite so far.', 'Akuma no Riddle: The Intriguing Battle Royale with Squandered PotentialAkuma no Riddle was an interesting take on the battle royale genre, that ultimately failed in delivering its promising concept. I won\'t go through the story as the synopsis is written down, but I will address some mild spoilers so keep that in mind if you want to go in 100% blind.Story: 6/10Unfortunately, the strongest aspect of this show was its plot. Most battle royale anime put a group of competitors against each other, with the last man standing as the winner. However, this show takes the concept and flips it on its head, by having...only one murder target, while everyone else is a competitor. With such an interesting premise, I was expecting this show to be really well made. Although, despite having such a fantastic idea, the delivery was horrendous. Without spoiling the show, I\'ll mention that the main plot twists and threads are introduced not when it\'s relevant, but when it\'s convenient. This results in the progression being rather convoluted. The story doesn\'t flow naturally, and feels like it is constantly travelling back and forth between plot threads that are introduced with abysmal timing. Akuma no Riddle wasted so much potential, and it really hurts me to see such an awesome idea go to waste.Art: 6/10The art isn\'t exactly bad by any means, but it\'s nothing outstanding either. It\'s the kind of art you\'d expect from a standard battle royale anime. At times the fight scenes had some interesting perspective shots that added to the intensity, but they were few and far between. If anything, these occasional jumps in quality were somewhat jarring to the show, and made the production quality feel inconsistent. The only time I really felt inclined to keep my eyes focused on the screen was during the opening.Sound: 6/10The sound design is nothing to write home about. The effects are your run-of-the-mill style sounds, although the music was very well composed. The opening song got me excited to watch the show, and the music played throughout the show was used at the perfect times. I feel that sometimes, the music was a little unnecessary, but not exactly harmful either. It was there, but didn\'t at all impact the scene in any way.Character: 4/10This will by far be the longest part of my review, because the characters were so poorly written that I would\'ve been better off watching Sword Art Online. Yes, I really do think they\'re that bad.The main character (Tokaku) is an apathetic edgy stereotype. She shows no empathy towards other characters and is constantly acting ""cynical"" however this cynicism simply comes across as blind and ignorant negativity. Although she strongly expresses her care for our side protagonist (Haru), she hardly ever gives her the respect she deserves. Tokaku acts like a two headed snake, doing anything she can to protect Haru one second, only to talk Haru\'s ideas and hopes down the next. As a protagonist, she blunders not only due to being cruel, but also due to her lack of relatability.A key aspect of Tokaku\'s character is her lack of parents. Both her mother and father are deceased, and I imagine the creator of the manga did this to provide a motivation for her constant negativity. It doesn\'t really feel like a solid motivation though, and feels like a backstory someone would write for their Sonic OC. It doesn\'t make her character feel interesting or easier to sympathize with, it quite simply feels cliche and half-baked.The saddest part of the characters, is that despite Tokaku being the protagonist, every other character in the show was more fleshed out than her. That isn\'t to say that the other characters are well written though, because they still feel like one-dimensional stereotypes. Most characters only got one episode each, which didn\'t give viewers enough time to grow attached. We got around twenty-two minutes to see what drove them. While some characters had some thought provoking motives, others were basic, almost flat. Much like the animation, the character quality was inconsistent and felt jarring to the show\'s progression.Enjoyment: 6/10Despite the harsh criticism I\'ve given the show, I\'ll give credit where it\'s due. The music was an absolute blast to listen to, and the story itself had a really kick-ass premise with some interesting twists along the way. So, would I recommend this show? Well, it could serve as good background noise if you need that, but otherwise it isn\'t all that great.Overall: 5/10I do think I am being a little harsh on this anime, but it isn\'t all that amazing regardless. Overall, I\'ll give it a 5/10. It lacked a lot of substance and could have done a lot more with some extra episodes and a good director.This is my first review here.

I hope you enjoyed it and thank you for reading.', ""This review contains some very minor spoilersAkuma no Riddle certainly had the potential to be good. The premise of a classroom full of assassins all going after the same target, who happens to be in the classroom along with them certainly sounds interesting. But an interesting concept doesn't mean anything if it's not executed well, and Akuma no Riddle, is not.I'll admit, I was set up for disappointment from the start when I decided to watch this anime, it was recommended to me as a yuri anime. This however, was incorrect. Akuma no Riddle is an action anime with very light yuri elements. This anime...only has a couple of actual girls love scenes, and they are brief and poorly executed.Moving on from that, it's time to discuss the story... it's bad. Like, really bad. Akuma no riddle is all over the place in terms of pacing, the story is hard to follow, but this may be for the best, as if you were able to follow it easily you would realize just how shitty and boring it is. Without spoiling too much, I can say that the story makes very little sense, seemed quite rushed, and doesn't at all pay off at the end, this is not a good anime to watch if you're looking for deep and interesting story.But, a mediocre to bad story can be carried by a really good cast of characters, we've seen it before, so how does Akuma no Riddle fare in terms of characters? I'd tell you if I could remember more than 4 of them. Akuma no Riddle's characters are awful. They are all very forgettable, with the exception of Tokaku, who is the one thing that keeps me rating the characters as a 1/10. There is no excuse for having a cast this terrible, especially for an anime like Akuma no Riddle, which has its very premise relying on interesting characters.But you know, a lot of the characters did have potential, many of them were interesting, but we saw so little of them. They're so forgettable because there is NOTHING to remember. Which gets to the root problem that  Akuma no Riddle has. It needed to be longer. The reason the pacing is so shitty is because so much was shoved into every episode. The reason the cast is so forgettable is because there was no time for character development. But I'm not going to let it off that easy, even with the short length of the series, the lack of character development is still absurd, all non-main characters have extremely bland personalities and motives (one particular white-haired girl is somewhat of an exception to this) resulting in a boring and forgettable cast.With all of that being said, Akuma no Riddle does have SOME redeeming qualities. Tokaku is a genuinely interesting character, and her relationship with Haru is the only thing that makes the story somewhat tolerable. But, if there is anything that makes this anime worth watching, it's the art and sound. Akuma no Riddle is pretty. It isn't top-tier, but it's certainly nice to look at, and although the characters were bland in terms of personality, their designs are unique. The soundtrack to Akuma no Riddle is leagues ahead of EVERYTHING else in the anime. It's honestly kind of strange to see it paired with such a disorganized pile of mediocrity and disappointment. The character songs would be better if the characters were interesting, but looking at them just as songs, they're all at least pretty good. Although this anime is flawed in almost every other aspect, credit must be given where credit is due, and this sound track deserves recognition.Overall, my opinion about Akuma no riddle is simple, it is an interesting concept, that was executed very poorly. The characters are shitty for the most part, the story is all over the place and to be frank, quite bad. The only thing Akuma no Riddle really succeeds at is looking and sounding pretty, but that doesn't matter much if it's completely hollow on the inside. I'm feeling a light 4 on this anime. only has a couple of actual girls love scenes, and they are brief and poorly executed.Moving on from that, it's time to discuss the story... it's bad.

The character songs would be better if the characters were interesting, but looking at them just as songs, they're all at least pretty good. Although this anime is flawed in almost every other aspect, credit must be given where credit is due, and this sound track deserves recognition.Overall, my opinion about Akuma no riddle is simple, it is an interesting concept, that was executed very poorly. The characters are shitty for the most part, the story is all over the place and to be frank, quite bad. The only thing Akuma no Riddle really succeeds at is looking and sounding pretty, but that doesn't matter much if it's completely hollow on the inside. I'm feeling a light 4 on this anime."", ""I found myself drawn to “Akuma no Riddle” because of the summary and the character design, but I ended up finding myself sadly disappointed by this particular Anime. This isn't to say “Akuma no Riddle” isn't an Anime people should forgo watching. The series simply fell flat because of all the cliches shoved into the series.I think my disappointment started in the first episode when I found myself reminded of “Noir” in a manner which made me feel “Akuma no Riddle” was unoriginal. After that I found myself reminded of to many other series. “Higurashi no Naku Koro ni”, “Dangonropa” and quite a few...others which I can't remember off the top of my head or couldn't quite place. There is nothing wrong with using other peoples work as inspiration, but in this particular case nothing new came from the series. The plot and characterization was to flat.This particular series falls under the “Deadly Game” trope. The plot for this particular trope is very straight forward. If you lose you die, and the main character must find a way to beat the system. A good series for this kind of plot relies on two things to draw writers in. The first tactic is to create some kind of puzzle the main character must solve which also gets the writer thinking. Said puzzle also needs to be unique. The other tactic is to have a strong roster of characters to work from.“Akuma no Riddle” fails in both aspects.The puzzles the main character needs to figure out are simple compared to many other series. The only two characters given development over the course of the series are the main couple. Series like “Dangonropa” and “Btooom!” happen to have the characters they used fully developed prior to the series starting. So what then is the draw for this particular series?I can't say it's the art work. The actual character designs for the characters in this particular series don't make up for the lack of character development. The design might be good for a slice of life Anime series, but not really for a series falling under the action genre let alone comprised of a “Deadly Game” trope. And that right there is the odd charm of this piece. The characters would actually fit better into a different story scenario.Another charm is the secret revealed at the end of the series. This in itself has execution problems and in reality there could have been more hints dropped for this particular series in regards to the secret which ends up finally revealed at the end. This series is also odd because of the number of yuri pairings worked into the series. The class size is rather small for the numbers shown, and normally when one sees this many the cast has a higher.This isn't a bad thing, but truth is this element could have been worked more into the secret revealed at the end.Despite my disappointment in this series I did find myself enjoying the series quite a bit, nor does it stop me from liking the series. In part I enjoyed seeing the potential of what this particular series could have been as I watched said series, but I also found said series relaxing to watch. others which I can't remember off the top of my head or couldn't quite place.

In addition, the lack of any really interesting personalities made the cast very lacklustre.I wasn\'t a big fan of the music. I hated the OP, and I don\'t remember the ED.My biggest problem with this anime is that for having such an ""edgy"" premise, it really didn\'t do anything to live up to it. It shied...away from a lot of mature content, yet still tried to portray itself as some sort of dark, action-packed thriller. There were very few on-screen deaths, and even when there were, it was very tame.This is a show that had the potential to be a sexy and intriguing, but it ended up being a boring battle royale. away from a lot of mature content, yet still tried to portray itself as some sort of dark, action-packed thriller.

It may seem difficult to find an enjoyable yuri anime, seeing how so many of them are flawed. A large portion of the anime in this genre frequently feel the need to constantly remind you of the genre by throwing a vast amount of fan service in your face as a requiem of some sort. Akuma no Riddle just almost crosses the threshold and had amazing potential.STORY - ""Battle royals are so cliche tho! I don\'t want to watch this shit!"" Well Internetman how do you successfully counter a cliche and generic premise? You have two...options, poke fun at the plot with satire or spend your entire budget to make it the best cliche you have ever seen. Akuma no Riddle tries to make the battle royal setting feel unique, but it took away the very element made so many people like death matches in the first place. Without the overwhelming suspense from shows such as Mirai Nikki, you lost what made us interested in the first place.Furthermore, simply the idea of the ending sounds like it was coined while masturbating on the toilet somewhere in the Sahara Desert. It feels very last minute and leaves a lot of plot holes.ART -  What held this anime up was it\'s animation. It felt very aesthetically pleasing, which I don\'t usually see in Yuri. The character designs aren\'t anything to jerk it over, but they are not bad.SOUND - The sound in this show is surprisingly well done. The opening theme song got me HYPE AS FUCK. Each different character had their own ending theme song which was cool. Again, nothing to jerk yourself over.Character - I\'ve said it plenty of times before, but fuck it I\'ll say it again.

After watching this anime, I can affirm that it definitely deserves the MAL ranking it has right now. This review will be mainly spoiler free, as all of my reviews.STORY: 4. When watching through this, I had so much trouble figuring out the true purpose of the story. Why are all the girls gathered to kill Haru? Why are so many girls involved (12 girls + Haru!!!)? What's with the riddles that Tokaku, the MC, gets from the one guy via a text message? After I finished...the anime, I kinda understand where the story is going at, but the way it was presented was so confusing especially towards the end. Then at the end, I was lost for words, in a bad way. If you're reading this and you watched it through, you'll understand my point of view.ART/SOUND: 7. These two categories is the only high point in this anime. The fighting and sound quality was good. Nothing that impressive, but it was alright stuff. If you are looking for a bit of action, the fight scenes are good, and the animation is good. Also, I liked the opening music :).CHARACTER: 3. I felt like if you needed a reason to hate this anime, here it is. Since there are so many girls and only so many episodes, how in the world are you going to pull off developing the characters effectively? Honestly, it came to the point where we got to know about each girls brief backstory and then they became irrelevant for the rest of the anime, with exception to the MC Tokaku and Haru, and maybe 1 or 2 more. It's only really Tokaku and Haru that we get an understanding of their story.Literally every single girl in the class of 13 girls had such distinctive, different personalities. If you could form a list of popular anime character types, most of the girls would fall into a distinct type for sure. Some people I guess might like this but I personally did not.Again, while we're on the topic of characters, I was extremely disappointed with the ending of the anime. If you've finished the anime, you'll know what I'm talking about.ENJOYMENT: 4. I came into this anime not having a clue about what it's about. It seemed okay at first, then gradually, and gradually, my enjoyment sunk as I saw a great deal of flaws coming out of this anime. Normally, animes that have some flaws won't bother me - I'm not really that picky with what I watch. It just added up and the things that bothered me only ended up repeating after each episode.OVERALL: 5. Animation and sound passes. Story and character, not so much. If you are looking for some action and a bit of suspense, this anime will give you some. There were many flawed parts that really dropped my score for this anime, but it wasn't completely terrible. I managed to get through it at least. the anime, I kinda understand where the story is going at, but the way it was presented was so confusing especially towards the end.

One slight tiny spoiler after the end of Story.Story: 7Akuma no Riddle is set in Myoujou Academy, an academy that teaches grade school through to university. In said Academy, specifically Year 10, is the Black Class. In this year\'s Black Class, 12 assassins face off in a competition to eliminate the 1 target among them, Haru Ichinose. The winner is given anything she desires, and failures are simply expelled. A pretty neat sounding concept, right?After finishing the series, the only thing that springs to mind when reviewing the story is \'wasted potential\'. Akuma no Riddle could...have done so much more, but instead decided to follow a repetitive structure for over half of it\'s short span and suddenly dump a whole load of \'what the fuck is going on\' in the last moments. I feel the issue with the story is either that the show was not long enough for what the writers wanted to do, or they took too long trying to do it. My biggest problem with AnR is that everything is just so convenient and just so happens to work out, but despite the issues it\'s not so bad the show is un-watchable.[SPOILER] It all went downhill after ""Let me show you my true form!"" [/SPOILER]Art: 7I\'m no expert with art, but AnR is visually pleasing. Nothing spectacular, but it\'s far from dull.Sound: 7Quite honestly one of my favourite OPs so far. It really fits the show and I found I never skipped it. One thing in particular I loved was how every episode had a different ED. I can\'t say I loved all of the songs themselves, but it\'s new (to me, at least) and added a little extra. The idea of using a new ED was to \'fit\' it to the assassin that the episode had focused on. For example, episode 5 is Haruki\'s ED.The OST as a whole is nothing memorable, but it works nicely.Character: 7This is where AnR had the most potential. Did it live up to it? Just about. Don\'t get me wrong, I found all the girls like-able, and I had favourites, but the only one I ended up caring for was Haruki. Almost every one of the assassins has their time in the spotlight to show their personality, motives and backstories. However, once they had this moment, they were gone.The main focus of AnR is the relationship between Tokaku Azuma and Haru Ichinose. Tokaku vows to become Haru\'s guardian, which explains the Shoujo Ai. Tokaku is, unfortunately, one of the most boring protagonists I\'ve ever come across. Tokaku is a frown on legs carrying a load of wasted potential on her shoulders. Haru, on the other hand, is so optimistic and cheery I want to leap through the screen and take her down myself. Haru\'s redemption, however, lies in her development. Watching her turn from a smiling bag of rainbows to a ballsy heroine that could finally hold her own was one of the best things about the show.Special shoutout to the homeroom teacher Mizorogi for being blissfully unaware and still trying to keep the class together.Enjoyment: 8Despite its issues, I enjoyed Akuma no Riddle very much. I\'m a sucker for survival games and a female cast, so I was drawn to this immediately. Did I expect differently? Yes. Am I disappointed? Only slightly. Would I watch this again? In a heartbeat.Thank you for reading!

All of this takes place at a high school, and in a particular classroom, called the Black Class.  Upon arrival, the 12 girls, who are shown to be assassins, are briefed on the rules, and go from there.  The ""rules of the game"" so to speak, are that the target must have a notice before being killed and that if a person is able to kill the target, then they are granted one wish, which could range from something simple as...money, to something elaborate as a writ to kill.    After the meeting, one of the girls, Tokaku, is against it and helps to protect Haru from the others.   That is the basic plot, without saying any spoilers.Story:   Already mentioned the main plot.  Each episode would roughly cover one of the 11 girls as they make their attempt in Haru.  Each of the girls has an unique way of attempting an assassination, which ranged from simple weapons like guns and knifes, to more unique weapons, some of which I can\'t say since it would be a spoiler.   During a given episode, you find out about what wish a girl wanted, and a brief flashback, that usually explains why they would want such a wish.   Given that this was a 12ep show,the pacing was quick, and the girls only got one episode that would focus on them.Art:  The anime style was one of the few that I enjoy a lot.  The color and tone of the rooms and the design of the girls, were nice and each of them had a slightly unique feature to them, whether it is being short, being tall, being flat chest, busty, etc.   And the clothes sometimes would match the person\'s personality too.Sound:   The thing that I liked about the show, was that each of the EDs were different.  Different video, different theme, and different song.   The sounds used were great, the BGM was minimal but enjoyable, especially the fight scene music later on.Character:   This is where Im split on rating it, but Ill explain the best that I can.   The characters themselves, were unique enough to be very different from each other.  Example would be that one girl had a more religious background, while another had an extensive criminal background.   With that in mind, the characters were very pleasing to watch and see interact, with my favorite being Hanabusa for reason that I can\'t say because of spoilers,   However, the characters suffered from a lack of complete background describing.  In other words, we were shown very little about the girls\' past, and thus there was simply not much to learn for any of the girls.   Usually, it would be something very short and basic, and that\'s it,   For those who do not like melodrama, then it wouldn\'t be an issue, but for those who want to know more about the girls, well, sorry, but that didn\'t happen much.    This is the second worse part about the show, but Im a sucker for characters that at least look nice, even if background info is lacking.Enjoyment:   I enjoyed watching each episode as the week went on.  They started kind of slow and dry, but when things picked up, it got better.   The one major thing that I absolutely did not like, was the ending.  I wont dare say it nor give an hint, but I wish they did the ending the way it should have been, rather than what some people would like.Overall:    Overall, this was an enjoyable show, but the ending was such a bummer.  The characters were pretty, the music was great, the art style was fine, and after the first couple episodes, it progressively got better.   My favorite episode was the 10th one, but there were others that had good moments in them too.   Oh, and lastly, for anyone looking at this in hopes of it being a yuri anime, better look somewhere else, because there were very VERY little ""girl love girl"" moments.  Maybe one kiss, but it wasn\'t intended to be a kiss.  Hope my review helps.  Im still working on improving my critic skills. money, to something elaborate as a writ to kill.

At first, you just think that she has no chance of surviving, but one of the 12 assassins, Tokaku Azuma, suddenly decides that she wants to protect Haru Ichinose.The plot is not that great, only 2 or 3 characters are really interesting, fights are average at most.. and everyone looks stupid..unless ? We\'ll talk about that later !SPOILERS AHEAD !The first two episodes are introduction episodes, where we meet all...the characters, and where the assassins are given a few rules to follow :- The one that kills Haru will be rewarded with one wish.- This is a normal high school. Nobody must know that you are assassins, and do not involve your teacher in this.- Every assassin will be given a black paper that is their chance to kill Haru. When they give this sheet of paper to Haru, they have 48 hours to kill her, or else they will be ""kicked"" from the classroom and have failed. More than one assassin can try at the same time.Keep these rules in mind, we\'ll need them later. Also keep in mind that Tokaku knows about these rules.Let\'s talk about the characters now, because that was by far the most frustrating part of the anime..Everyone is stupid. Litteraly everyone. But I\'ll start with the target, Ichinose Haru.Haru tried to be friend with all her classmates. Yes, she knows that they\'re here to kill her, but she tries. Haru for fucks sake just think about it ONE SECOND and you\'ll understand that this is a shitty idea.When Haru finds a black card on her bed that says something like ""Death is the end of everything"", she\'s like ""I wonder what it means..."". THINK, HARU, THINK ! THEY\'RE ALL TRYING TO KILL YOU, REMEMBER ?One day after finding that card, Haru hears about ""a hidden book"" in the library, so she asks Tokaku ""Hey, let\'s go in the library during the night to find it !"". Tokaku answers by saying that this is too dangerous because there\'s still a death sentence on her for 24 more hours, and that they could easily be attacked in this dark and closed space. Haru insists. Tokaku accepts. wait..what ?So they go. Yes, really. They go to the library when it\'s dark, and the assassin just casually blows up the library. Yeah, we already don\'t give a fuck about this being a NORMAL HIGH SCHOOL anymore. And this is only episode 4. Then why does it take place in a normal high school ? To be honest with you, I just don\'t know.There could have been some really interesting development with the teacher or with characters that are outside the Black Class? But, apart from the assassins and their relatives, nobody is never involved. They never even talk to someone else, to another student, another teacher..Talking about the teacher !Remember the ""Don\'t involve your teacher"" part ? Every assassin finally gets kicked out of the class. At least one of them gets kicked every episode (from episode 4 to episode 10). A few episodes before the anime ends, the teacher starts doubting.. but about himself. I mean, he\'s a good teacher tbh, he really thinks that he did something wrong. The high school principal tells him that, no, he did everything right, and he\'s like ""Oh, okay, thanks :D"" and leaves... wait, that\'s all ? There could have been some really interesting development with him, where he could start worrying about them and find out about something. But no, nothing.Yeah, if you\'ve read my review that far, you\'ve probably already understood that your brain won\'t be useful if you watch this anime. You\'ve also already understood that we don\'t care about the rules anymore, the characters don\'t give a fuck about them. Except the black paper rule, but again.. this is disappointing.Whenever one of the girls approches Haru, Tokaku starts getting suspicious. Nothing more. That\'s really frustrating, because you might just think ""Hey, be more careful, a girl might just come, give Haru a paper and slice her throat in the second !"". That happens a few episodes later, but somehow, the assassins just suck and can\'t kill her.Whenever Haru\'s in danger, Tokaku just tells her to stay there and hide, and runs after the assassin. You might ask, ""What if two girls team up and a second one tries to kill Haru while she\'s defenseless ?"". Yeah, this happens too, but the psycho girl with a massive hammer can\'t even hit her. Remember that Haru is not an assassin and has not been trained in any way. Somehow, again, the killer.. can\'t kill a defenseless girl, and that\'s reaaaaaaaaaaally frustrating. And you wanna know why ? Keep that in mind.Let\'s talk a bit about the fights. As I said before, they\'re really average. Half of the melee fights between Tokaku and another girl is just people swinging a knife up and down, and the other one dodging with the same 4 frames looping.Some of them have plans for killing her. One wants to blow her up (and the library), another one wants to poison her, but they all fail.. Keep that in mind too.Rarely, something a bit more interesting can happen. One of the assassins called Inukai Isuke tries to poison Haru really early in the anime by making her drinking poisoned tea. Haru wakes up fast, and tells Isuke that she has ""undying magic"" that protects her from death.. Is this a supernatural ability? Keep that in mind, again.During the last two episodes of the anime, you finally learn about the truth about why Haru is a target. Yeah, Haru being from a wealthy family felt wrong, and it was wrong. I mean, she really is from a wealthy family, but this is not the reason everyone wants to kill her.The real reason is because she is suspected of having an ability, called ""Primer"". Primer makes her a ""Queen Bee"", making her able to emit pheromones to control others and make them protect her, like a Queen Bee of a hive would do.Remember the three ""keep in mind""s ?- Why can\'t an assassin kill a normal girl ? Because she has the Primer ability, so the assassins instinctively refrain themselves from killing her.- What about the ""undying magic"" ? At that point, we already know that there are supernatural abilities because one of the girls is immortal. Oh, I forgot to talk about that, there are already so many things wrong at that point. But what about this undying magic ? If Haru is immortal too, why does she fear being killed ?- What about the girls that tried to poison Haru ? It is strongly implied that none of the girls was able to kill Haru because she is a Queen Bee... well, she would have died from poison if she was not immune to this (or maybe immortal, we don\'t even know). These girls did use poison to try to kill her. Were they not affected by Primer ? Who knows..And finally, the good ending.From the beggining of the anime, it is not knows what happens to the girls after they leave the class. I said earlier that they got kicked, but we don\'t really know. In episodes 11 and 12, we finally learn that they all died.We already witnessed two of them dying together : one gets stabbed in the chest, the other drinks poison. But we learn that all the other ones died as well. Haru is emotionnaly unstable, because she considers that these deaths are her fault.Tokaku finally choses to kill Haru, because she wants to free her from this suffering, and stabs Haru in her chest, making Tokaku the only survivor.Well, in reality, nobody died.. Haru had platinum ribs (LITTERALY). The other one that got stabbed survived, even tho she was lying in a blood puddle.Tokaku didn\'t kill anyone during all the episodes because she couldn\'t. Everytime she tried, she would remember her mother telling her not to kill. But in the last episode, for some reason, she remembers his again, and she\'s now able to kill ! Why ? I don\'t know, don\'t ask me.In the end, this just felt like I watched this for nothing. Fights were bad, but this was justified by ""they just could not kill her"". Assassins being stupid too. Every death that could really have an impact on the spectator is just cancelled. Feels like a lot of wasted potential. the characters, and where the assassins are given a few rules to follow :- The one that kills Haru will be rewarded with one wish.- This is a normal high school. Nobody must know that you are assassins, and do not involve your teacher in this.- Every assassin will be given a black paper that is their chance to kill Haru. When they give this sheet of paper to Haru, they have 48 hours to kill her, or else they will be ""kicked"" from the classroom and have failed. More than one assassin can try at the same time.Keep these rules in mind, we\'ll need them later. Also keep in mind that Tokaku knows about these rules.Let\'s talk about the characters now, because that was by far the most frustrating part of the anime..Everyone is stupid. Litteraly everyone. But I\'ll start with the target, Ichinose Haru.Haru tried to be friend with all her classmates. Yes, she knows that they\'re here to kill her, but she tries. Haru for fucks sake just think about it ONE SECOND and you\'ll understand that this is a shitty idea.When Haru finds a black card on her bed that says something like ""Death is the end of everything"", she\'s like ""I wonder what it means..."". THINK, HARU, THINK ! THEY\'RE ALL TRYING TO KILL YOU, REMEMBER ?One day after finding that card, Haru hears about ""a hidden book"" in the library, so she asks Tokaku ""Hey, let\'s go in the library during the night to find it !"". Tokaku answers by saying that this is too dangerous because there\'s still a death sentence on her for 24 more hours, and that they could easily be attacked in this dark and closed space. Haru insists. Tokaku accepts. wait..what ?So they go. Yes, really. They go to the library when it\'s dark, and the assassin just casually blows up the library. Yeah, we already don\'t give a fuck about this being a NORMAL HIGH SCHOOL anymore. And this is only episode 4. Then why does it take place in a normal high school ? To be honest with you, I just don\'t know.There could have been some really interesting development with the teacher or with characters that are outside the Black Class? But, apart from the assassins and their relatives, nobody is never involved. They never even talk to someone else, to another student, another teacher..Talking about the teacher !Remember the ""Don\'t involve your teacher"" part ? Every assassin finally gets kicked out of the class. At least one of them gets kicked every episode (from episode 4 to episode 10). A few episodes before the anime ends, the teacher starts doubting.. but about himself. I mean, he\'s a good teacher tbh, he really thinks that he did something wrong.

Episode 11 leaves off on a massive cliffhanger that actually is resolved pretty...well when you finish the series, however where that cliffhanger is cured, an ENTIRE different slew of problems arise.I absolutely cannot stand deus ex endings, and I really, really don't like in general how they wrapped this story up. It had so much potential, so INCREDIBLY much potential to be a great anime, but they choked at the very end with wrapping up the story. They could've done almost anything else, they could add a truly thoughtful message/action in, they could culminate the relationship of the characters, but instead? They just threw a bunch of garbage together and had it be completely ineffective.I still recommend watching this anime if you're into battle royale style anime. Throughout the entire thing, I was wondering how this was rated so poorly by the community because it was extremely good, but don't expect anything good from the ending whatsoever. It was the biggest let down of any anime series I've ever watched. well when you finish the series, however where that cliffhanger is cured, an ENTIRE different slew of problems arise.I absolutely cannot stand deus ex endings, and I really, really don't like in general how they wrapped this story up.

I just turn off my brain and enjoy them. So I gave this a try and... well███STORY███It\'s bad. Like really bad. Looks like something written by a ten years old for the big amount of stupidity and inconsistencies. Is totally impossible to take this seriously from the start. Just look at the plot: a bunch of girls (professional assassins who don\'t reach 18 years old) go to school. The only purpose of...this is killing one of their classmates, who is totally aware of this. They take turns to do so and everything. The professor who gives classes to them (because for some reason they have to assist school while trying to kill someone, of course) knows nothing about this, and he\'s so stupid that doesn\'t notice that something is wrong even when the amount of girls that leave his class is too big. Then we have the target of the killing (Haru), who is so stupid that wants to be friends with people who is trying to kill her. Luckily, she has a bodyguard, who used to be one of the assassins supposed to kill her, but know she\'s protecting her because... because reasons [(actually, this is explained later)].Then we have the inconsistencies. And I\'m not just talking about how a girl can stop a bullet with a saw (which actually happened and I was supposed to take seriously), but other kind of stuff. Like, this looks like it happens in the real world (our world), but some characters have superpowers. For example, there\'s a girl who doesn\'t age. The show barely explained things, so maybe those weren\'t real superpowers.Do you recall the famous phrase from Emiya Shirou ""People die if they are killed""? Well, it doesn\'t apply to this show. People who are supposed to be dead came back to life because yes.The killing themselves wouldn\'t be that bad if the girls actually focused on killing instead of wasting time. I don\'t know what is bigger: Haru\'s plot armor or the assassins\' stupidity. They are like those villains from movies who can finish you off with one hit, but instead tell you all their motivations and plans, so someone can come to your rescue.""Well, the survival sounds really shitty. What about the romance?""What romance are you talking about? This barely go deeper in the relationship between Tokaku and Haru. I wouldn\'t know that this was a lesbian show if MAL hadn\'t told me.███CHARACTERS███Though I like the design of the characters, their personalities fall in archetypes. They even used the most third-rated character traits like split personality and psychopath serial killer. Luckily, the show actually tries to do some character development. Sadly, it fails.Talking about the main characters, Tokaku is fine. She\'s probably a one dimensional character, but I don\'t have a problem with her. In the other hand, Haru is really annoying. Not only because she talks about herself in third person (which I found really irritating), but because she\'s actually too dumb to realize that she can\'t be friends with her assassins. And does nothing aside from jumping straight to the danger because of that.If I were Tokaku, I\'d let her die because she\'s asking for it in an unconscious manner.███ART███I liked the art.

Akuma no Riddle totally givesyou this impression about it right from the first episode.Story 7/10The reason I gave it a 7? Because I was a little disappointed by how not-so-deep, compicated/not understandable this series turned out to be. It gives you that perfect impression at first but as the episodes continue you kind of find out it's a bit shallow, but it still has a good storyline, just not one that would blow...you away, especially the ending which I found pretty lame, ruining the enjoyment you had most of the series. It was just a plain, normal ending, nothing as special as I predicted. They didn't solve the riddles either, that made me upset. :cArt 9/10I absolutely loved the art! It was very pleasant, I liked it ❤️Sound 9/10I almost always skip to the episode through most animes, but the opening was great to watch and listen to..Character 7/10Okayy.. I'm not a big fan of Yuri, but halfway through the series I almost forgot there was supposed to be some kind of love story between Haru and Tokaku. Seriously, if you're searching for a lovey-dovey story or characters then this isn't your type, you'll be disappointed. The rest of the characters are great, i didn't prefer them though. A 7 because there was some actual work to come up with their background stories, only for that, they weren't that creative, sadly. Character development isn't massive here either, except maybe a little for Haru and Tokaku. You don't even get to bond with the characters to feel them, the other assassins would've became a huge success if only the series wasn't just 12 episodes, if we had enough time to know them better.Enjoyment 7/10Honestly I got bored in the middle and wanted to quit the series, the episodes were repeating themselves just with a different assassin each episode. The art saved this series big time, and the sounds also, including the great voice acting.Overall 7/10It was a nice anime with a good plot and good characters, nothing more nothing less. I thought assassins were scary killing machines like Killua in Hunter x Hunter, but this series changed my mind.. The assassins were all helpless and proportionally weak for assassins, especially Tokaku..

Their personalities compliment each other-Haru is naive, cheerful, and bubbly, while Tokaku is often serious and all business. It's fun to see how they interact.Now on to the other characters-the assassins who will be making attempts at Haru's life. Because of the show's set up, the anime is episodic, with an episode focusing on one assassin at the time. This...gives each character a chance to be at the spotlight; the character's backstory and motivation are also discussed in the episode. And each of the assassins have unique personalities that are different from each other. They also have different ways in attempting to assassinate Haru, ranging from the old fashioned way of using a gun  to a sort of game of sorts. This makes each episode interesting.The anime is also beautifully animated and the fight scenes are well done.The music of this show is very good! It has one opening, sung by Maaya Uchida. However it has 12 EDs, with the singer being the spotlight character of the episode. And yes, they are all good!The Ending of the anime, without going into spoilers, is kind of a base breaker. Either you like it or you hate it. I actually like it, but can see why there are people who hate it.Nevertheless, Akuma no Riddle is definitely a fun show. It can have it's flaws, but it has interesting characters, good fight scenes, and great music, and I think it is worth a watch.Are you ready to countdown?

There is no way out to run!"", 'Story (6)-The show presents itself as a sort of psychological thriller at the start. All these assassins gathered in one place to kill one girl. Sounds a bit over-the-top but you get a little bit more interested as to how this is going play out. Unfortunately, it fails to execute it\'s pseudo-psychological aspect properly because how horribly ineffective some of the characters are. Because of this, it\'s hard to truly feel like the main characters are in any sort of danger. The story works semi-episodically, with small plot points scattered throughout the show but never really feeling like a story until later in the show....It tries to act like some big complex show at the start, slows down in the middle, and tries to reassert itself as a complex show at the end. That said, when there is actual plot, it\'s good enough that you say ""this isn\'t as terrible as I expected."" The episodes prior to the build-up of actual plot are pretty formulaic.*very mild spoiler*Assassin announces (that\'s right, announces) that they\'re targeting the main character, character tries to figure out why, background info on assassin, main character defeats assassin, rinse and repeat*end mild spoiler*There\'s also not much action to be had in some episodes. Some feel like they were lazily scripted and even though these are assassins, they aren\'t very good at providing enough action for this to be an action anime. Suspense sure, but the action is few and far. Finally, the last thing I should mention is that the deus ex machina is heavy. The biggest one is around the end and, essentially, renders the previous episodes obsolete. If you hate that kind of device, steer clear from it.All that said, if you can see past these flaws (like I managed to do), then the story will be decent enough to enjoyArt (10): I rarely factor art into my enjoyment of a series unless it causes me physical pain to watch it but the art was generally appealing with few or no complaints. Characters,settings, etc were done nicelySound (9): Solid voice acting here. The background music did the scenes justice for the most part minus a couple of times where it felt a little off but the music was overall fitting. I don\'t factor opening or ending themes into my ratings either but the OP was good enough and each episode ended with a song sung by the assassin who was the focus of that episode. All were done well except for a couple but otherwise, catchy.Character (5): Here is where the show stumbles. These are some of the most best assassins around and yet, I can\'t help but feel the entire show would be over a lot quicker if the assassin just straight up tried to kill the main character instead of turning it into some sort of mind game. Their methods of going about assassinating are so asinine, it\'s a wonder that they\'re even assassins at all. Luckily, there are a couple of genuine badasses of the bunch that make me appreciate sticking around the show but holy hell, most of them are ridiculously ineffective. Additionally, the backgrounds of some of these assassins are really vague, leaving us unable to truly understand the characters. ""This happened, and that happened"" and that\'s it. No real why\'s, how\'s, or even what\'s are addressed. The backgrounds of the main characters, while a bit more developed and clearer than the assassins, still have some missing questions that have us scratching our heads to the very end.It\'s also hard to see characters really develop when they only appear for one episode per assassin (some fewer) but the ones who do end up developing, they pull it off nice enough that you can sort of see past their flaws. Other assassins just felt really generic and pulled out of antagonist vault. By far, the best development comes from our two main characters because where else are we going to get any development with the show? Even then, however, it isn\'t too big of a development.The main antagonist, the host of this assassination games, just doesn\'t feel like there is enough reason for her to be an antagonist. Sure, they try to make her look evil and badass but ultimately, I couldn\'t really perceive her to be a threat. At the end of the day, a lot of these villains are forgettable except for a couple of unique individuals. The target of these assassins might also get on your nerves if you hate those ""can\'t we all be friends"" types. There\'s a limit to how optimistic you can be towards people who are actively trying to kill you.Enjoyment (7): I know. I did all this nitpicking and I still enjoyed it? Well that\'s because I rarely let these things bring me down. I enjoy film, TV, books and even if it\'s the worst of them. I try to just enjoy the show for what it\'s worth.Overall (7): I remember hearing a saying that went something along the lines of ""I only nitpick at it because I love it."" While I don\'t quite love the show, there is still something to be enjoyed here.While it\'s not quite memorable enough to leave a deep impact, it is a show that if someone mentions it to you, you\'d probably remember it vaguely and be able to give a rough sketch of your feelings for the show. Would I recommend it? Well if you\'re the kind of person who enjoys fleshed-out and well-developed characters with an intelligent, coherent plot, this probably won\'t be your cup of tea. If you\'re anything like me and are blissfully ignorant of flaws and immune to nitpicking and you\'ve got a couple of hours to kill at the airport while you wait for your flight and you want a show that you wouldn\'t mind doing a marathon of it on your phone, then this is probably the show for you. It tries to act like some big complex show at the start, slows down in the middle, and tries to reassert itself as a complex show at the end. That said, when there is actual plot, it\'s good enough that you say ""this isn\'t as terrible as I expected."" The episodes prior to the build-up of actual plot are pretty formulaic.*very mild spoiler*Assassin announces (that\'s right, announces) that they\'re targeting the main character, character tries to figure out why, background info on assassin, main character defeats assassin, rinse and repeat*end mild spoiler*There\'s also not much action to be had in some episodes. Some feel like they were lazily scripted and even though these are assassins, they aren\'t very good at providing enough action for this to be an action anime. Suspense sure, but the action is few and far. Finally, the last thing I should mention is that the deus ex machina is heavy. The biggest one is around the end and, essentially, renders the previous episodes obsolete. If you hate that kind of device, steer clear from it.All that said, if you can see past these flaws (like I managed to do), then the story will be decent enough to enjoyArt (10): I rarely factor art into my enjoyment of a series unless it causes me physical pain to watch it but the art was generally appealing with few or no complaints. Characters,settings, etc were done nicelySound (9): Solid voice acting here. The background music did the scenes justice for the most part minus a couple of times where it felt a little off but the music was overall fitting. I don\'t factor opening or ending themes into my ratings either but the OP was good enough and each episode ended with a song sung by the assassin who was the focus of that episode. All were done well except for a couple but otherwise, catchy.Character (5): Here is where the show stumbles. These are some of the most best assassins around and yet, I can\'t help but feel the entire show would be over a lot quicker if the assassin just straight up tried to kill the main character instead of turning it into some sort of mind game. Their methods of going about assassinating are so asinine, it\'s a wonder that they\'re even assassins at all. Luckily, there are a couple of genuine badasses of the bunch that make me appreciate sticking around the show but holy hell, most of them are ridiculously ineffective. Additionally, the backgrounds of some of these assassins are really vague, leaving us unable to truly understand the characters. ""This happened, and that happened"" and that\'s it. No real why\'s, how\'s, or even what\'s are addressed. The backgrounds of the main characters, while a bit more developed and clearer than the assassins, still have some missing questions that have us scratching our heads to the very end.It\'s also hard to see characters really develop when they only appear for one episode per assassin (some fewer) but the ones who do end up developing, they pull it off nice enough that you can sort of see past their flaws. Other assassins just felt really generic and pulled out of antagonist vault. By far, the best development comes from our two main characters because where else are we going to get any development with the show? Even then, however, it isn\'t too big of a development.The main antagonist, the host of this assassination games, just doesn\'t feel like there is enough reason for her to be an antagonist. Sure, they try to make her look evil and badass but ultimately, I couldn\'t really perceive her to be a threat. At the end of the day, a lot of these villains are forgettable except for a couple of unique individuals. The target of these assassins might also get on your nerves if you hate those ""can\'t we all be friends"" types. There\'s a limit to how optimistic you can be towards people who are actively trying to kill you.Enjoyment (7): I know. I did all this nitpicking and I still enjoyed it?

Good thing, \'cus it isn\'t very long.However, the characters are very weak. They\'re supposed to be these highly-skilled and/or smart assassins, but really they are not. It\'s hard to really get into it or have a sense of danger and excitement when the antagonists and protagonists continuously make stupid, obvious mistakes.Art, sound, etc was ""okay"" but nothing groundbreaking or memorable.I did like the first ending. Near the end, there\'s a few pretty good and unexpected plot twists that I didn\'t expect for this anime. I also liked...the conclusion of the character arcs, it felt completed.However, the show manages to ruin this ending with a 2nd end, I think it was in the final half of the last episode. In that end, they ret-con a bunch of stuff. I would have liked it better had I not seen that part. the conclusion of the character arcs, it felt completed.However, the show manages to ruin this ending with a 2nd end, I think it was in the final half of the last episode.

There's a whole lot of potential but not much bite. This can be attributed not the fact this show is based off a manga written by yun Kouga.

Just like how loveless is a shonen ai with barely any romance much less non ambiguously gay characters, akuma no riddle is a action survival series filled with fluff.The basic premise is that Haru Ichinose is...enrolled into this class filled with highly trained assassins and they all want to kill her. Except for the other lead characters, Tokaku.

Haru spends most of time being chatty with her would be killers and always acts so surprised when they try to kill her. Anime writers need to understand there's a difference between optimism and plain old stupidity. No rational person would act like this and tokaku calls her out on this multiple times.There's also the weird fact that each assassin is only allowed one chance to kill Haru and they all just give up after they fail. They're each promised a wish should they win and they all decide to try to kill Haru in the most elaborate ways possible. Plot armor is the only reason why none of them were smart enough to just catch Haru alone and snap her neck. It's like this show is afraid to get too gruesome and just goes for the most passive way possible. I admire tokaku for her no killing stance but she could've still severely crippled those evil girls.I do admit I found most of The assassins to have interesting backstories and motives. They could've benefited from a longer format to fully flesh out their characters.  I don't like how the morality of the characters isn't really addressed and Haru never seems bothered that she surrounded by assassins. There really isn't any justice here. I also love the cinematic feel the soundtrack has. It made me feel like I was watching a movie even though the show would show any thing impressive enough for such music.

My favorite though was the opening song, that got me pumped up to watch the show every time. The endings were all good, with a few unique songs that stood...out. I liked how each episode there was an ending song for each assassin, and also for the target, Haru.Characters: 7/10Most (if not all) characters had their time to shine, most getting their own episode to show their reason for being an assassin. Though, I feel they didn't do enough for some characters, and I ended up not feeling anything towards them at the end of the episodes/anime. One thing I really hated was that Haru stayed pretty much the same throughout the show - very gullible and naive, constantly saying she wants everyone to graduate, pretty much forgetting that everyone around her is AN ASSASSIN that wants to KILL HER!Enjoyment: 7/10The fight scenes were enjoyable, some plot twists that kept me watching the show, along with the music, not much to say here.Story: 4/10The story... my god this was a mess. Not to mention that the series was very unoriginal, and felt extremely episodic, almost every assassin getting an episode for their attempt. I felt I knew exactly what was going to happen even before I started each episode (with the exception of a couple). Also, THAT ENDING, I HATE that some of the assassins somehow MAGICALLY LIVED through this... Especially the Romeo/Juliet girls...

(13 if you count the OVA)That formula itself is not good. With so many characters and so little episodes you can predict the anime will try to give each character its own little piece of screen time, but it did not work...out well.Akuma no Riddle followed an episodic format that made it predictable.Seeing each characters backstories and failed attempts just gets boring. But probably my biggest issue with this anime is that the characters....are pretty dumb.So, you have Haru Ichinose, she\'s being targeted, right? She knows this and even gets a notice every time someone will attempt to kill her, and you know what? SHE\'S STILL FRIENDLY WITH THEM!?I mean seriously, if people have tried to kill this girl her ENTIRE LIFE, If you, are in a dark room with another girl assassin, and you just got a notice that you will be killed, you DON\'T GO AND ASK:""Oh, Haruki-san? Have you seen Tokaku-san? She wrote me a memo of how she wanted to see me here urgently...""NO, BITCH, YOU RUN.I mean seriously, this girl Haru\'s dream is to want to live right?

IT SEEMS INTERESTING, IT DOESN\'T FOLLOW THROUGH!But anyway, some good points, music is good, like I said before, each character has their own ending, the opening grew on me too, it really sets up the mood, but unfortunately, the anime wasn\'t as dark as I expected.You might enjoy it, I...wanted to enjoy it, but I\'m sure most of us MALians will agree it didn\'t fulfill much of it\'s potential.Thanks for reading! out well.Akuma no Riddle followed an episodic format that made it predictable.Seeing each characters backstories and failed attempts just gets boring.

It is an overall enjoyable experience if you bear in mind the short running time. I personally found the end disappointing, however.Story - 6/10.I enjoyed the premise of this show - a kind of Danganronpa-esque survival game within the ""Black Class"", a class of 13 students. It wasn\'t totally butchered; there were some interesting plot twists here and there and the pacing was okay for such a short anime, however because of its shortness, it did feel a little rushed at times, for example some of...the battle scenes could have been expanded on a little more, and similarly to Danganronpa we lost a character per episode on average, which didn\'t allow the watcher to fully connect with the story.I also did not enjoy the ending. I don\'t understand why the show went through killing them each episode for that to happen at the end. Maybe I missed something.Art - 8/10.Decent character design, I enjoyed the animation generally. Thought the battle/action scenes were eye-catching and didn\'t leave you wanting.Sound - 7/10.I really enjoyed the soundtrack to this, Soushou Innocence by Maaya Uchida fit the theme of the show relatively well and set up a mostly fast-paced action-filled episode each week. The voice acting was good, the only voice that really irritated me was Haru\'s, but that\'s personal preference as opposed to bad seiyuu. I thought for the most part the voices fit the characters.Character - 5/10.This is where the show tripped itself up a little - though this is mostly due to the short run time of the anime, only 12 episodes. Each character was relatively unique from one another, though I didn\'t think any character really screamed originality this didn\'t really detract from the anime as their interactions were still interesting.However you never really get any chance to get attached to any of the characters, their backstories are briefly outlined but because they tend to disappear rapidly we don\'t get a chance to root for anyone, to really appreciate why they are here and why they became an assassin.The relationship between Ichinose and Tokaku was never properly expanded upon, which is a shame, it would have added another dimension to the anime however this again suffered from time constraints.As a result we get quite one-dimensional characters with no chance to really learn about what their true motives, drives, etc are.Enjoyment - 8/10.I did enjoy this anime, although the last two episodes left me with a ""meh"" feeling. It looks and sounds good, no glaring errors there, and the story itself is a good watch, and it does get quite gripping at points.I would recommend this to those who like anime which will have them on the edge of their seats at times, however don\'t expect a masterpiece. the battle scenes could have been expanded on a little more, and similarly to Danganronpa we lost a character per episode on average, which didn\'t allow the watcher to fully connect with the story.I also did not enjoy the ending.

What could have been praise-worthy material is brought down to a rather anti-climatic end. It stops the viewer, painfully, from giving a score that it would otherwise deserve.Action. Drama. Gore.

But with Haru, the whole show.This creates a surprisingly interesting dynamic between Tokaku and Haru, we see Tokaku vulnerable as hell almost trying to control Haru to hide this vulnerability whilst Haru grants her this validation Tokaku desperately craves for own safety, consciously or unconsciously? Idk.Anyways, its edgy, fun and has lots of yuri; so much to enjoy![Story] 6/10It's fine. Despite its premise, pretty okay.[Art] 5/10Not amazing, just passable.[Sound] 5/10It wasn't bad but I can't remember any of it.[Character] 7/10Except for the main 2, the super gay ones and the cyborg, they were pretty forgettable.[Enjoyment] 8/10I liked its little quirks and the overall coherence in the show.

Not only that but there is a chance i can have some of my questions answered.

On the same point, remember when someone told you there\'s a really great prize, and whoever gets their hands on it FIRST is the winner. And then you go ""yeah I\'ll be the 8th person to take a shot"". Because, why would I...mind missing out the prize without getting a go?Then, they don\'t even die. The girls slap each other a bit => assassination is then deemed to have failed. The the girl leaves school. Put a nice flower on the desk.

What could go wrong?Everything.The series introduces some interesting concepts in terms of assassination, scenarios, backstories and characters. All of which fall flat. The characters are badly explored as well as the relationship between our two protagonists. Each episode is about one of the enemies our duo have to battle. These characters have backstories and motives which are rushed through and that's it, they get defeated and we move onto the next one.All could've been (maybe) forgiven if the ending hadn't been like that.

I dropped it at episode 6 and just decided to read how it ends, because it was so bad, I just wanted to get to it quicker.  Basically, a group of assassins are brought together to kill a cheerful schoolgirl named Haru.  You instantly know that Haru is going to be some kind of assassin herself, as no normal schoolgirl is going to be targeted for death by a dozen assassins, or be covered in scars, or be immune to drugs.  Haru immediately gets...an ally in Azuma Tokaku, the heir to another clan of assassins, who decides to defend her instead of kill her.The whole set up is so ridiculously contrived with a set of rules that these schoolgirl/assassins must follow.  They must declare they want to kill her before they target her, then do it in 48 hours and if they fail, they must leave the school.  If they succeed, they get one wish for anything they want.The first and biggest problem with this anime is Haru.  She\'s just completely brain dead as a character.  Even knowing how it ends, there\'s no excuse for her insane levels of gullibility and stupidity.  She\'s so dumb, the anime would\'ve made more sense if she was just testing Azuma\'s ability to defend her from herself, rather than being in a test herself.  She trusts everything every person sent to kill her says, she tries to befriend everyone, she runs headlong into danger without a thought to her situation, she even refers to herself in the third person like all classic anime ditzes do.  I wanted her to die and cheered when she almost did several times.The second problem is Azuma.  She has the personality of a petrified rock.  Stoic, boring, ""tortured"", and pretty much unlikable all around, she did nothing to make watching this anime worthwhile.The third problem is just a lack of logical sense.  This was thing that ran me off in the middle of the anime.  I just couldn\'t take it after the Romeo and Juliet play, with Chitaru and Hitsugi.  Hitsugi killed Chitaru\'s mentor\'s daughter, so Chitaru went to the school to find her, even though she didn\'t know what she looked like.  Once she found out the person she befriended was who she was looking for, she confronts her during their play. Hitsugi, for completely nonsensical reasons, decides to kill herself on Chitaru\'s knife. The moderator of the game then tells Hitsugi that Chitaru\'s wish was to leave the school with her. (WHY THE HELL WOULD THAT BE HER WISH?!)  and then Hitsugi decides for even more nonsensical reasons, to drink Chitaru\'s poison and die along side her. Keep in mind, these girls knew each other for probably a month. They did it just to mimic Romeo and Juliet in real life during the play. It was so dumb, I couldn\'t take anymore. I had to drop it.The half of the anime I watched was rife with this kind of stupidity.  And having read the rest, I\'m glad I dropped out, because it didn\'t stop right up until the end.  Why did Haru\'s ability only work on Azuma and no one else?  Why would they have to tell her they were planning on killing her? What target actually gets warned? How would letting her know test her skills?

A very big thumbs up from me!Character-Well, it comes with my favourite character ever created, so all i can say is- good job!The characters were suited with each other, each one had their own cliche to do, but sadly, around 10 had a purpose of 1 episode... and then the others were either 2 eps or the whole anime.It has characters like the main (Tokaku Azuma) which was really well done, and (Haru whatevertheheck) which was also done well, but with tons of cliches, and she receives my thumbs down, because, go see for yourself... If you\'re not a fan of the f***ing cliches, jesus.Then comes my favourite character- Nio Hashiri, silly, cute, serves nearly no purpose, but to prove she does, well... ergh, go watch.Enjoyment-Well i had plenty of fun, and i didn\'t waste or regret any of the seconds that went into watching those 12 episodes of girls battling and shiz... I do recommend you watch it.Overall:Lets go over with pro\'s and con\'sPROS:+amazing characters+well made story+Amazing soundtracks and voice actors+Very good animations+surprises served the ""purpose of surprises""CONS:-Too much cliches-way too predictable-Too clingy with all the ""happy ending"" theme-cliches-clichesoverall, well, i put a 10 out of 10, but if i wouldn\'t have enjoyed the anime, it would have been an 8.5/10 maximum.

But in terms of actual substance, it had many weak points.Before I get into that, though, I just want to comment that, for a show in the yuri genre, there really wasn't a lot of yuri. Plenty of female characters, sure, but not a ton of romance. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it might be something you want to consider, if you're looking for yuri.The story was very basic. For the majority of the episodes, you know exactly what's going to...happen, because they all follow the same set-up. No real plot development happens from the first two episodes till the last two. The ending almost surprised me, but then it concluded in a very trope-ish way, unfortunately. But the story creates a great premise to showcase the characters, which are the real highlight of this show.There are so many characters in this show that I can guarantee you that you'll find one you love. Part of the issue, though, is that each character gets pretty much just one episode, so you don't get a lot of time with them. But each episode focuses so much on each character that it feels like enough. The EDs are a testament to how much thought is put into each character's personality and story, and they provide for a lot of great music. And they fact that they chose to produce new, fantastic art for each ED is also really impressive.Overall, I'm pretty confident in the 7 I gave this show. The plot is repetitive, the romance is barely there, and each character besides the main two is only given around twenty minutes of screentime (one gets none at all). But there's always great action and fight scenes, a new character to get to know, and a devil's riddle to keep you wondering well after the episode is over. happen, because they all follow the same set-up.

The concept was interesting enough, but it wasn't something I hadn't seen before in one way or another.Tokaku Azuma, the story’s main protagonist, is sent to Myojo Academy to participate in a competition between other assassins where the main objective is to murder Haru Ichinose (for seemingly unknown reasons). After vowing to protect Haru, both of their developments take a backseat to the side characters.The show tries so desperately to cycle through each assassin within such a limited amount of time, that even the characters with the right potential just end up falling...flat.Not much is known about ANY of the characters until their designated episode comes up, and even then, it’s cut in half because the anime tries so hard to explain their back story. I’d say that there was SOME foreshadowing with a few of the later characters, but a lot of it felt so cryptic that the anime actually needed to hold my hand.The show’s strongest character is Tokaku. Although her relationship with Haru felt forced at times, Tokaku really was the most consistent character of this story. Her motivations and development were at times overshadowed by the next punching bag’s struggle, but at least an effort was made to prove she wasn’t a completely 1 dimensional character. Aside from her, the only other notable characters are Haru and Nio.Fortunately, the art was good. There were times where it seemed a little awkward, but for the most part, it was refreshing and clean. There’s nothing notable about it, but at least you won’t get eye strain just from looking at it. Some of the girls had a nice design, too.The plot, much like the characters, is a bit rushed and sloppy. Actually, I would go so far as to say that the real plot ends prematurely. After a certain episode, it’s all exposition and resolution. This wasn’t really a bad thing considering how many characters it had to shuffle through, but I refuse to believe the last episode held any true significance due to how the story ended. In fact, nothing was terribly bad about the plot until the final episode.As rushed as this anime was, it was extremely easy to watch. My interest was never completely lost, and the fast-paced action actually made it enjoyable to rewatch. The flaws are evident, but it never felt like a chore to sit through.There’s also some yuri in it if you squint, but I wouldn’t watch it based on that alone as most of it is just subtext. That being said, there were only two actual relationships in the whole anime (three, if you actually care about poorly constructed back-stories).Despite all these flaws, Akuma no Riddle is something you can pick up quickly. If you’re interested in lady assassins trying to kill someone, then this anime may be something to look into. I wouldn’t exactly recommend it, but it’s not something I would discourage against watching either. flat.Not much is known about ANY of the characters until their designated episode comes up, and even then, it’s cut in half because the anime tries so hard to explain their back story.

They need to success in order to get the prize from killing Haru. The school offers any wish they want to get, there\'s also consequent for those who fail, which will be dropped out of school. Everyday school life is stained by the intention to kill and tension of each other. Talk about the fighting, it\'s good but not superior. The killing intention vibe raises up and the whole mess starts.Since there are so many characters, these assassins have their own uniqueness.

In comparison to the other girls in the class she's average to say the least.

However, it is widely considered a Yuri series;  even though there\'s nothing explicit and no real talk of love, most fans interpret the two main girls as romantic partners. They can also be interpreted as close friends. Whether you think it\'s Yuri or not, ""Akuma no Riddle"" will probably delight anyone who likes assassin stories, well-animated combat sequences, and of course pretty-but-deadly young women.The art is great, the story is interesting, and the main characters are unforgettable. However, ""Akuma no Riddle"" is certainly not perfect. The worst flaw...in the series occurs at the end, and while I won\'t tell you what happened, many fans were upset with it. Yuri fans like me were also disappointed to see so little physical/romantic affection between the two girls. Also, the music isn\'t really memorable, and the opening song is just plain annoying. These are the kind of flaws that prevent ""Akuma no Riddle"" from being rated any higher. Still, I think it\'s good overall and I encourage you to watch it.Personally, I loved the character Tokaku Akuma. Her fighting skills are amazing, she\'s emotionally strong, and she is loyal almost to a fault. Whether she is a lesbian or not, her devotion to the other main girl is outstanding. She reminds me of myself, except I\'m not that great with knives and obstacle courses.

Akuma no Riddle is a mix of both.The anime starts off very strong. There\'s enough mystery to keep you on your feet and the first few assassination attempts are suspenseful and intriguing. The main character is bad-ass, yet not over-powered.  If the anime stayed at the level of quality that there was in the beginning, it could have easily landed on my favorite\'s list.There\'s not much character development, but hey, there\'s 13 characters squeezed into 12 episodes. To be honest, I didn\'t even mind that...much. Although I will say the story might have been better with fewer characters. Maybe 10 instead of 13 would have sufficed.As the show progresses, the assassination attempts become ridiculously convoluted. I cant say much without giving away spoilers, but at times it seems like the assassins are trying to fail. That, and the episodes became somewhat predictable as they started to follow a set formula.The romance between the two MC\'s has development near the beginning, but then tapers off. At times there was little chemistry between the two.There\'s not much else to be said. This anime is mostly empty entertainment, so don\'t expect anything life-changing or outstanding.

I watched the whole series in one day and if I don\'t like something I usually put it off or eventually drop it but something was different about this one.Story: 5/10I don\'t even know... It was strange to say the least. If it was just a story about finding a new top assassin by eliminating the others that would have made more sense. But it wasn\'t really about that exactly. Something about primes.. and bees.. and...I don\'t even know. But I found the eliminating part entertaining I liked how each character had their own episode and even their own ending theme. I like focusing on one character at a time with big casts like this until it gets narrowed down. But there were some plot points I found confusing and weird. All in all if it wasn\'t for the full cast of female characters which I\'ll get into later I\'d drop it after 10 seconds.Art: 8/10Nothing groundbreaking but oh lord the girls were so freaking cute. Every single one of them were just so nice to look at. I liked the colors and the backgrounds and the shading of the hair and everything. The character designs were just awesome. All the girls looked so cute especially Isuke lemme just fangirl for a sec she was cute as hell. Anyways the art wasn\'t really groundbreaking but it was nice to look at. I liked it.Sound: 6/10Like I said I liked all the music except maybe the opening it got old after a while but the ending songs were different each episode and I liked that. The sound effects themselves were passable and fine. I had to watch the dub because it\'s all Funimation had. I feel like the score would be higher if I watched the sub because the dub voices were not my favorite except for maybe Tokaku. Haru\'s voice got kinda annoying near the end. So probably go for the sub if you want to watch this.Character: 8/10Now other reviewers say they\'re bland stock characters but I don\'t fully agree. While they are ""types"" I feel like they still stood out and were original. I loved the robot arms on a certain character and all the girls were just CUTE AS HELL. I have a soft spot for all of them. I wish this was more of a yuri but it had the shoujo ai elements which kept me focused as well. It was super cute. I liked the dynamic with Tokaku and Haru and the whole ""I\'ll protect you"" angle. And let me say again Isuke is my WIFE.Enjoyment: 7/10I know I won\'t be rewatching this one but it still kept me entertained to the end and will probably stick with me. I loved the characters and that\'s the most important part for me of any anime. I found myself rooting/yelling at characters etc so I was really kinda into it.Overall: 7/10Seems high but I still liked it although the ending could have been a lot better seemed too abrupt for my liking. I\'ll probably watch the OVA soon.All-in-all I recommend this if you want something easy to watch with lots of cute girls fighting in skirts while being tough and most importantly no male characters to pause the plot. I don\'t even know. But I found the eliminating part entertaining I liked how each character had their own episode and even their own ending theme. I like focusing on one character at a time with big casts like this until it gets narrowed down. But there were some plot points I found confusing and weird. All in all if it wasn\'t for the full cast of female characters which I\'ll get into later I\'d drop it after 10 seconds.Art: 8/10Nothing groundbreaking but oh lord the girls were so freaking cute. Every single one of them were just so nice to look at. I liked the colors and the backgrounds and the shading of the hair and everything. The character designs were just awesome. All the girls looked so cute especially Isuke lemme just fangirl for a sec she was cute as hell. Anyways the art wasn\'t really groundbreaking but it was nice to look at. I liked it.Sound: 6/10Like I said I liked all the music except maybe the opening it got old after a while but the ending songs were different each episode and I liked that. The sound effects themselves were passable and fine. I had to watch the dub because it\'s all Funimation had. I feel like the score would be higher if I watched the sub because the dub voices were not my favorite except for maybe Tokaku. Haru\'s voice got kinda annoying near the end. So probably go for the sub if you want to watch this.Character: 8/10Now other reviewers say they\'re bland stock characters but I don\'t fully agree.

The characters were likeable and all had different traits and cool designs which I enjoyed a lot. But what bothered me most was just that everything was soooo predictable. Like it was so obvious when and how something significant was going to happen and who would be there etc. I liked it when it started, but as it went on, everything just became incredibly predictable and obvious. Minutes before a scene would happen, in my head I would be like ""yep i bet this...much that this character is gonna do that in this place"". Idk I wish they could have made it less predictable and more entertaining. But other than that I think it was alright, not the best but it wasn\'t a waste of my time. much that this character is gonna do that in this place"". Idk I wish they could have made it less predictable and more entertaining. But other than that I think it was alright, not the best but it wasn\'t a waste of my time.', ""This show was good, I enjoyed it, not a masterpiece and not great but very good!See, most of the aspects of this show are good, but the characters are where this show gets very fun. I highly enjoyed the show, although it did not end strong.I would recommend this if you don't mind it when a show gets strange towards the end, even though the ending was satisfying it certainly was strange. I couldn't say much about art but I didn't mid the style, certainly no Bakemonogatari but good enough for me!___________________________________________________________________TLDRGood wacky show with a strange concept but decent excecution "", ""Akuma no Riddle has a dark and alluring plot that seemed like it could've explored many interesting ideas however it failed to actually feel mysterious.Akuma no Riddle follows Tokaku Azuma an assassin trained by the infamous Azuma clan. She along with 11 other assassins are enrolled into Class Black. Their goal is to kill a girl named Haru Ichinose, who is also attending, in exchange for killing her the killer gets one wish of their choosing. After hearing who the target is Tokaku is compelled to protect Haru instead. Each episode follows Tokaku attempting to protect Haru from...her classmates and slowly uncovering the nature of Class Black. Akuma no Riddle has some interesting ideas that actually got me somewhat interested to see how they'd play out, like some of the murder schemes. However, the main problem with Akuma no Riddle is its mystery, or lack there of. The big overarching mystery throughout Akuma no Riddle is trying to find out the true reasoning of why Class Black exists, or at least its supposed to be. I felt like there was absolutely nothing that implied that this plot even existed and was even being driven forward. Nothing was ever set up that would've indicated that there was an ulterior motive. The closest thing would have been the riddles given to Tokaku throughout the entire anime, by some mysterious man that Tokaku knows. These riddles were likely intended to guide the viewer along in order to solve the mystery of why Class Black existed however, there really wasn't anything indicating that they were even related to Class Black at all. Since the reasoning why these riddles even were given in the first place was extremely vague, and are unintentional misleading. The riddles felt like they related to the person giving them, which some of the dialogue suggests. As a result they felt tact on because they were given by someone who had zero plot significance at all. When any shocking revelations were revealed I felt like they lacked any impact because they had zero foreshadowing to back them up. Contributing to this problem is that Akuma no Riddle decides to drop into the plot with no world building at all. It doesn't bother to introduce any of the concepts that would be important later on and just expects the viewer to know by the time they are important. Akuma no Riddle's story feels like making a puzzle that is missing countless of pieces. It didn't give anything for me to actually think about and instead just sets them down expecting me to understand.Akuma no Riddle's main characters aren't the best either. Tokaku is your average cold distant girl, who is all business. Her personality doesn't make her fun to be around as she lacks any traits that would make her a likable character like snark or unexpected talent. She isn't even that cool despite being an assassin because she doesn't do anything overly clever and mostly just handles everything with above average knife skills that are often on par with everyone else. Her backstory is at least somewhat adequate. Throughout the anime her parts of her childhood are slowly revealed and they help to explain why she is the way she is now. This at least made her feel like there was a reasoning behind most of her actions and was kinda nice to see. However, only a very small portion of her past is revealed and doesn't help indicate why she acts the way she does is. We only get really get to see 2 or 3 moments from her childhood. Nothing about how she was raised or why she was even in Class Black are revealed. She feels shallow and there isn't anything that would imply her current motivations. Similarly, Haru has very little backstory. Haru's backstory consist of only one traumatic moment of her childhood and that's it. Nothing interesting about Haru is every uncovered until the very end. Haru's backstory defines her character throughout the entire anime and as a result Haru feels static that never actually grows or learn anything despite what she's been through. Its especially painful considering that Haru is so optimistic to the point where it feels like she actively puts herself in danger. She walks into obvious traps and is way too trusting of her classmates who she knows are all out to get her. Seeing Haru do all this was frankly frustrating and it was hard to even care about her when she did so many idiotic things. It made me wonder why Tokaku was even helping at all. Which leads into another big issue. The relationship between the two of them is also never explored in depth. Its implied that Tokaku and Haru have feelings for each other, but nothing is ever shown to indicate that, besides a couple blushes. Akuma no Riddle doesn't take time at all to build the relationship between these two, even in a non romantic way. There is hardly any scenes of them just talking to each other,being friendly or even getting to know each other better. Most of the time they are together its Tokaku protecting Haru or Tokaku telling Haru to be careful and running off to fight one of the other girls. There was no real relationship between the two as it just felt like a girl protecting another girl for no reason. Akuma no Riddle tries to play off these problems by making them part of the mystery, however there is nothing here to make you question of the nature of their relationship.The other characters are somewhat better however, they have their own set of problems. The other 11 students of Class Black are actually fairly unique. Some of them fall into anime tropes, but for the most part they don't act like stereotypical anime girls at all. They range from ruthless killers to snobby aristocrats and they are pretty open about their desire to kill Haru. This was pretty fun to see, however you barely get to spend time with any of these characters. This mostly due to the fact Tokaku never interacts with them. This took away a lot of the fun this anime could of had because most of the time you don't get to spend time with the rest of the cast. This is also becomes a problem because each episode explores the backstory of one of the students of Class Black and their reasoning for wanting to kill Haru. It was really hard to sympathize because most of their motivation come out of nowhere. There was no subtlety when conveying why these characters were here and the anime just flat out tells you what the reason is without building it up. They could've built it up by adding subtle hints in the dialogue but since there was so little character interaction there was never a chance to do it. It was especially hard to care because after their attempt to kill Haru they are completely removed from the anime, so any emotional attachment I could've had with to them just disappears along with them. Some characters don't even get the luxury of getting a backstory either and are simply removed for no reason at all. I feel like all these problems exist because of the length of the anime. Its almost impossible for an anime to make me care about 13 characters in 12 episodes it frankly needs more time to really let things develop out naturally instead of forcing it down when it thought it was necessary to get the plot forward.Akuma no Riddle was also really stupid at some points. There were plenty of Deus Ex Machina moments where Haru clearly should have died but there was something there to conveniently protect her. There was even one part where one of the girls could have killed her guaranteed but instead decided to play a game instead for no reason. Some of the characters motivations were absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical. There were also some lines that cracked me up just because they sounded like they were trying way to hard to be cool. All of this really took away from the seriousness of the plot and instead of becoming invested and curious to see what was coming next I ended up laughing at how cheesy it was.The animation is also poor, especially the fight scenes. During fights, none of the combatants strikes had any impact to them and it looked like they were awkwardly swinging their weapons. Another problem is how a lot of the weapons were animated poorly in CG. It was such an eyesore to see them carry around their ugly CG weapons which contrasted poorly with the rest of the show. Outside of fights, the animation look average with nothing particularly catching my eye. The characters themselves also looked fine and I liked some of the character designs. The music wasn't the best either and I did not like some of the tracks used during fights. The different ED themes unique to each character was a nice touch at least.Akuma no Riddle tries its hardest to seem mysterious, and frankly it fails to feel that way. Combined with the poor handling of its characters and it was struggle to get past this one. Its really a shame because I feel like this anime could work if it had more time to build up everything, but everything feels shallow and a waste of potential.Thanks for Reading!My RatingsStory 3/10Characters 4/10Art 4/10Sound 4/10Personal Enjoyment 3/10Overall 3/10 her classmates and slowly uncovering the nature of Class Black.

The girls might seem a little cute and ditzy, but when it comes time to do their jobs, they will drop the act and go full killer mode! Also, while there are certain antagonists,some of the girls in Class Black aren't actually evil. It's just that they are fighting for a certain cause which some can see as just. It is why for this anime, viewers can't help but sympathize for them. The Opening and Endings are awesome. I particularly love the 9th episode's ending the most.

I like the dedication of the animation to dedicate the ending song animation to every characters that attempt to kill the target but of me its too sudden.Having 1  or 2 characters per episode is quite fast for the story. They should make the story quite longer so that they can portray every character in the manga as the way they've should bebut the romance spice to the story is too bland. No kiss nor any confession (...if there was one I'm sorry). If the genre of this anime is a Shoujo Ai then they should make the romantic scenes more intense than being soft to the center. if there was one I'm sorry). If the genre of this anime is a Shoujo Ai then they should make the romantic scenes more intense than being soft to the center."", 'CONTAINS SPOILERS!////As you may have already seen in the synopsis of Akuma no Riddle it is a kind of battle royale between the classmates of the so called ""Black Class"". You may suppose lots of violence will be seen and that the main two, Ichinose Haru and Azuma Tokaku, will have some character development.Haha, not really.The first two episodes are slow. All the class members are getting to the school used for the Black Class. In these two episodes they show mostly what kind of people the assasins are and how Ichinose wants to live her last high school year, plus a little bit of...intimidating each other. As everyone is present they have a meeting where they reveal the predictable target they have to assasinate. They get some rules and Azuma reveals how she will protect Ichinose instead. So it begins!Episodically the assasins start going after Ichinose. These aren\'t too bad, but it depends on the invidual whether they\'ll find it enough of a characterisation. What was bad about this is that not all of them get to show their personality and/or their background story (Hashiri Nio and Kenmochi Shiena per example). Also, the way they go about the assasination differs greatly. Some were pretty stupid and the amount of violence in the action scenes are pretty minimal.They did do something interesting with that which are the different endings that fit the character that failed the assasination of that episode. Again, some endings looked a lot better than others with most of the ending being pictures of them and a sequence where they show some of the action in their silhouette.Furthermore about the story: Ichinose doesn\'t really grow and stays the same determined to live, cutesy gal. Azuma on the other hand changes her perspective on life and sort of accepts her history to be able to well now. She kind of likes Ichinose for that, but because of this perspective and the weird explanation as to why the Black Class exists in the first place she does something so stupid after the fight with Hashiri. And ta-da! Seems like everyone is alive for some reason and some stay friends with each other for some reason!The music of the opening, endings and background are pretty good but not that special or gripping. They fit the show and never felt awkward, but are forgettable. As for the art: it\'s pretty cool, the characters look fine and mostly fit their personality. The animation is smooth and colorful. Nothing really stood out to me which is good and bad. Bad because nothing looked outstandingly beautiful and good because it didn\'t drop in quality and stayed consistent.In general, pretty average, but because it was never boring to me and I enjoyed the show I find it fair to give it a 6. The animation helped the score quite a bit, that story though.BONUS: This anime does contain little to no yuri scenes. Read the manga if you actually wanted some form of yuri (the manga isn\'t really yuri either though).

I don\'t know, it\'s like it has everything I could want in an anime and yet it still left me wanting. It\'s devoid of the anime cliches I dislike (save the high school setting but I won\'t knock it for that). It lacks many cliches others tend to dislike, fan service and no strong female characters. I like the premise, story and characters. The art and action was good, and the story has sufficient twists. But the whole thing is just too predictable. Maybe had I watched it as it...aired I would have liked it more. But knowing it was only twelve episodes creates a villain of the week formula that gives the story predictability.They say it\'s about the journey not the destination, but I\'ve always disagreed. If it was about the journey you wouldn\'t care where you ended up, that\'s my problem with this series. The destination is kind of important here as it completes the story. The journey seems routine, a simple formula to follow just to get to the end. It was cool to watch and I really enjoyed watching it but eleven assassins in twelve episodes...you can kind of see where this is going fast. I like how the story incorporates the incompetence of some of these assassins into to it. There were several times I questioned why these trained assassins are struggling to kill an ordinary high school girl. Also the end. I\'m not a big fan of this style of ending. I know why they do it but it still change the fact that...I do not like this style of ending. A detailed expression on this would contain spoilers so I let it go at that. In summation I\'ll recommend this series with a ""but"". BUT, don\'t expect to be blown away for find your new favorite here, (far be it for me to dictate the tastes of others, it\'s just my psychotic opinion) you\'ll watch it, it\'ll be over and you\'ll move on to the next series.One more note: I think it\'s important to point out the difference between ""good"" and ""great"" and that\'s what I\'m doing with this review.

How in the hell is a premise like that supposed to work?Answer: with outstanding visuals, mesmerising combat, great characters and a story that will tug at your heartstrings from beginning to end.So the story begins with Class Black, a special little group of 13 girls gathered together for one purpose: 12 of them are supposed to go after the 13th. And the brilliant thing is everyone is aware of the status quo. Well, except the teacher - how quaint - for whose benefit the whole ""pretending to be a real class"" thing is....Poor clueless sensei.So, enter our main heroine, one Azumi Tokaku. She is an emotionally challenged bad-ass that, given the tools, would give any would-be assassin a run for their money. And she is totally hot in a tomboyish sort of way. She comes into the whole thing on orders of her superior -  one very f*ked and crafty psychologist named Kaiba who pesters her with unanswerable riddles throughout the seires - with nary a want or goal of her own until she meets...Ichinose Haru. Oh man. This girl. Even if you didn\'t know the premise beforehand and even if somehow you missed the first intro - which totally would give it away - she is. from the moment she comes on-screen, most obviously the target.

It really was worth watching!! Rather than being an esoteric anime with rubbish character development and plot, this anime actually showed you the lives of the people that are usually written off as the ""Bad Guy"", making you have sympathy for the characters. If you really love the series and wish there were more, Yun-Sensei definitely answered you\'re prayers, because there is a 13th episode coming out in December. ', ""Akuma no Riddle is a really great Assassin Anime, everything has the feels, but the end was kinda.........not spoiling!The art is great, the story is really nice, and I love all the characters so much!Can't really remember which character I like best though.This was the time when I decided to watch more serious Anime, with blood and stuff (like 1-2 years ago), I couldn't really handle Anime like that, since my mind couldn't really handle that kind of stuff, so I decided to watch this, and this I really liked!Overall, i'm gonna give this an 8/10, well I would like to give it an 10/10,...but the ending kinda made me say......okay......and still not spoiling!I recommend this still! but the ending kinda made me say......okay......and still not spoiling!I recommend this still!"", 'Akuma no Riddle, alternately Riddle Story of Devil, is a rather refreshing deviation from your typical super moe ""cute-girls-doing-cute-things"" genre of yuri anime. The concept of ""assassin yuri"" insinuates that Akuma no Riddle would mix the genres of suspense, drama, action, and yuri efficiently; I\'m glad to say that it was executed rather decently. Of course it is not without its flaws, and to be frank, is just as easy to pick apart as it is to find enjoyable.Plot: 6/10As you would expect, this premise requires the ""monster of the week"" format, and it does get predictable very quickly. Not to mention there...are quite a bit of plot holes, and there we\'re a few instances where Tokaku and Haru should died without their plot armor protecting them. The pacing also feels a bit rushed and cut for time in a few instances. However, it does deliever some twists here and there to keep things interesting. The action does not dissapoint, and I was actually surprised at how dark it was. This is no Sakura Trick (not that Sakura Trick was bad, mind you.)The yuri aspect of AnK was a bit lacking though, as there was hardly anything explicitly yuri-ish (kissing, holding hands, etc.) but there is a lot of subtext and there\'s little doubt as to who\'s paired up with who.Art/Sound: 9/10Rather impressive. The animation was smooth, the art was pleasing to look at and the contrast in some scense doesn\'t strain the eye either. The soundtrack was bizzare, but in a good way, and helped to create a gritty and mysterious atmosphere. The OP is one of my favorites of any anime, but one of the best points of the soundtrack would have the the many EDs, each sung by the character\'s voice actress after they are expelled.Characters: 7/10I\'d say the anime\'s biggest focus was on the characters rather than the plot. Interesting characters overall, as they didn\'t stick to typical architypes for the most part. Each assassin does have their own backstory though, which makes them redeemable and gives a reason for their actions. My biggest qualm with the characters however, is that some just didn\'t have enought screen time to fully give them depth and make them really believeable; they are more developed in the manga though, which is to be expected for a 12 ep anime, to be fair, as there were most definitely time constraints regarding the characters considering just many of them there are.Overall enjoyment: 8/10As an impartial reviewer, I give an 8/10, but personally I rank it as 9/10. Each week I found myself anxiously anticipaiting the next episode, and was overall impressed and found Akuma no Riddle very enjoyable. If you feel stuck in and endless rut of moe and are looking for an entertaining, more character driven action/drama, then Akuma no Riddle is definately a breath of fresh air. are quite a bit of plot holes, and there we\'re a few instances where Tokaku and Haru should died without their plot armor protecting them.

It is those five minutes that has me refraining from giving the anime a rating of ten, as the main character nearly goes and ruins everything up for near to no reason. However, unlike most anime that has it's last episode as the weakest, it's repaired (although weakly) before the anime ends so it only subtracts minimally.As I already said, the anime is easy to watch, and most of the characters are given...enough time that you begin to understand them, something that's rare in a 12 episode anime containing this many characters.The anime is brilliantly written, with the exception of the aforementioned scene, and is definitely worth checking out. enough time that you begin to understand them, something that's rare in a 12 episode anime containing this many characters.The anime is brilliantly written, with the exception of the aforementioned scene, and is definitely worth checking out."", 'If I had to sum this anime up in two words, it would be cringey nonsense.The plot is about as contrived and nonsensical as it gets. It\'s about 12 assassins who are assigned to a classroom with one ""normal"" girl, who they\'re supposed to find and kill. That make much sense to you? Me neither. And the ending very much comes across as ""I didn\'t know how to justify the absurd story so this is some bullshit I came up with"". It tries to play it off as a plot twist, but the story and the characters are so poorly written, the audience probably...isn\'t invested enough for it to work.There are too many characters, and each with her own shoddy backstory that\'s supposed to somehow explain her shoddy motivations. These backstories are both wholly uninteresting and increasingly ridiculous. Although, the problem isn\'t really that there are too many characters, because even the leads are horribly underdeveloped stock characters stuck repeating the same shoddy lines over and over again. One has about as much personality as unseasoned chicken and never changes whatsoever, except when the plot demands that she does; the other is a paragon of unconditional friendliness and virtue, which, in the scenario of this anime, means that she comes across as the dumbest person alive.Also, if you\'re here for the GL tag, leave. It isn\'t really GL. More queerbait than anything. The only blatant romance is between the girl who looks like a 30 year old pirate and the girl who looks like an elementary schooler.

I was also quite sure that at most, half of the girls died but in the end, all of them were alive.Just want to share, I thought it was something also where pick your own girl to cheer but maybe I chose wrongly since I chose Takechi and Haruki....Takechi was the first girl to be eliminated.

The progression and pacing is pretty good, despite some of the assassin characters having significantly less of a role to play in the story than others. Given that it's an action anime, I wasn't expecting too much exposition, but there's actually a decent amount between and sometimes intertwined with the action sequences. Why did I give a 6/10? Some of the story direction is pretty poor; mainly the ending, which I think would have been better left to the...viewer's imagination, rather than the fairly cheap ending that Akuma no Riddle has.Art - 9/10One of the areas that Akuma no Riddle does really well, in my opinion. Not quite perfect, because of the occasional use of shark teeth, which I found a bit jarring, in relation to the generally serious and relatively dark feel of the anime. The colour palette works well for both light and dark scenes, but definitely seems geared toward darkness, which I thought complimented the generally tense atmosphere that a lot of the scenes are tinged with. The character designs are also really good, with a good level of detail being apportioned to each main character. The detailing also extended to the weapons (accurate depictions of modern firearms for example) and equipment that get used by the characters, which is always good to see. It's also worth noting that the interval artboards were a nice feature and were always interesting to read/ look at.Sound - 10/10The area that Akuma no Riddle excels in. In contention for one of my all-time favourite comprehensive anime sound sets. Each episode starts with Sousho Innocence, which (although I'm not a big fan of rock music) sets up each episode as being tinged with tension and danger. On a separate note, the track itself is (probably unsurprising from Maaya Uchida) really good, in terms of vocal performance and backing track composition.The score/ scene BGM was not far behind, doing a great job at reinforcing the tension and danger associated with each action sequence and goes hand in hand with the art style. Oddly enough, there were a few tracks that also stood out and particularly caught my attention, which is never a bad thing, in terms of immersion or a metric of engagement. It's also worth noting that not many musical pieces get reused, which is good news for those who crave sound variety.Each episode has its own ending theme, which was a bit hit-and-miss (personal preference really, as they use a variety of genres), but understandable, as they're each attributed to a character if I'm not mistaken. It's worth noting that some of these themes perfectly reflect the score in its creating an atmosphere of tension. In addition, all of the ending themes include vocal performances by the character VAs, which is always great to see, especially given how high quality they are as pieces of music, period :)Character - 7/10Somewhat unsurprising I guess, but each character is most definitely distinct and unique. Each having both a clearly-distinguishable appearance, but also signature weapon/ tool of the trade. VA performances weren't especially spectacular for the most part, but they do naturally fit the characters and are pretty good nonetheless. The combination of unique appearances, outfits and behaviour patterns (as well as the character themes) make for a pretty memorable character set, which is always a good thing. For an action-themed anime with so many different characters, I think they managed to fit in a good amount of character development (though more could probably have been done, I felt, with reference to time/ content being wasted on the ending). I think they could maybe have a bit more yuri involvement between the characters as well, though I will admit, there is a decent amount, given the context in which the characters interact with each other.Enjoyment - 8/10I came into Akuma no Riddle expecting it to be a run-of-the-mill action anime with little story content and not much underpinning motive to the action, but those preconceptions were destroyed fairly quickly. The anime progresses more like a thriller than anything, with most scenes being charged with tension, which kept me fully engaged at all times. Slower-paced scenes were interesting to watch, in that they helped explain out the background and gave context to the actions and events of the anime. Combat sequences were pretty good, thanks to the variety of weapons/ tools that are used throughout. The extensive use of handguns with only one hand was a bit weird though, along with the firing position of an SMG that appears at one point.Overall - 7/10Some areas were outstanding and others were just okay/ meh.

Thanks to the fandom, I learned this anime came out plenty of time ahead of much of the manga. While that is no excuse, it should put into perspective the stark differences and the ""stuff more people liked"" being in the manga and not the anime. The anime started after the manga had just concluded around the third assassin\'s attempt, so everything afterward, the anime actually went on plot first. The manga chapters that came out after added to what the anime established.With that out of the way,...onto the review. The anime is solidly watchable. The premise is not that special, being a survival game with shoujo ai subtext (not really yuri). Only two of the seven relationships get any screentime and one character is completely thrown aside. Some early scenes that might have heightened character were lost in translation, though the characters and their varied personalities are still very prominent. Some are tropey-er than others, and some are better than others. The appeal is the wide range, I would say, in the girls in this class of supposed killers.Mechanics and execution-wise, the anime focuses away from relationships and more onto the action and music. The soundtrack is stellar, though that can only cover for so much in a series where the relationships are supposed to be the mainstay.The art is nothing special, but it\'s also not bad. It is augmented well by the lighting of their eyes, often.Overall, I think this is fine and watchable. Over the years I came to appreciate this a lot more thanks to the VAs and the fandom. The anime on its own, though, can only please so much. It is more of a springboard into the fandom for the fish who bite, and a complete snooze for others looking for something more substantial. onto the review. The anime is solidly watchable.

The general concept of the anime, in which twelve female assassins are hired to an academy to pretend to be students while attempting to kill their thirteenth class member, Haru Ichinose, is refreshing, but the concept of the Queen Bee is confusing and ultimately irrelevant. Where this anime shines is in the romance that develops between Haru and one of the assassins, Tokaku Azuma. It's highly rewarding to see the character development Tokaku undergoes when compared to the other assassins, and how...she goes from a bloodthirsty killer to devoted guardian (and potentially lover) of the hapless and cheery Haru, who may not be as innocent as she appears to be. Kudos to side characters Sumireko Hanabusa, a rich girl who has a horrific backstory that provides an interesting foil to Haru herself, and the au-pair Hitsugi Kirigaya and Chitaru Namatame, whose relationship mirrors that of our main characters, and prove as a foreshadowing of the danger such a relationship can hold.

Assassins assassinating other assassins in order to assassinate a victim that has an assassin protecting her.-OverallThe story of Akuma no Riddle is told episodically, with each episode focusing on one assassin to characterize. While this was fun in it\'s own way, it caused many problems. The premise isn\'t explained too much, and this way of storytelling caused the characters to be horribly underdeveloped. The art and sound were good, average really, but the characters, although interesting, end up laughably underdeveloped and not really likable at all. It\'s a shame, since Akuma no Riddle seems to focus on the action and characters, but...the characters fall short of their goal.

While the premise isn\'t explained well at all, (What is this ""assassins network"" that Tokaku works for? How does it work? How are people recruited into this network?) I still enjoyed the episodes. Each episode a different assasssin has the spotlight alongside the main characters, who specialize in different weapons. While it can get monotonous, the action is well choreographed. Some episodes are ""whatever"", others are very good. (Episode 6 was probably my favorite episode. It was cool with all the Romeo and Juliet parallels) The plot isn\'t amazing, but it\'s nice in its simplicity. However, Episode 12 ruins the plot. Don\'t watch episode 12.-ArtThe art looks good. It seems to be ""shinier"" than contemporary works. Nothing special, though.-SoundThe voices and soundtracks are average. They\'re good, but not extraordinary. The opening theme is pretty cool. The ending theme is different each episode, sung by the voice actors of the characters that ""perished"" in that episode. That\'s pretty cool, but I didn\'t really listen to them anyways.-CharacterThere are many assassins in Akuma no Riddle with interesting enough backstories. However, because the anime is so short and each backstory gets on average 3-6 minutes, the characters end up being laughably underdeveloped and not really relatable. I mean, I can feel the anime trying to get me to feel sympathetic, but most of the time, I just laughed at how badly the story was delivered. Haru, the main character that all the assassins are targeting, is really dumb.

Promising fun idea having a normal student trying to survive with a room full of 12 assassins. Seems like something full of wit and clever characters. Too bad it\'s played way too straight and no one is deep enough to be clever. Maybe this just wasn\'t for me but I walked away with meh opinions because everyone was so guarded.StoryBunch of female assassins compete with their classmates to kill one girl, the main difference here is that each assassin gets only one 24 hour period of their...choice to kill her. I\'d say it\'s a battle royal like story, but like mixed with school life story. It\'s the highlights of school life where the cold character hangs out with the timid target. There\'s some slight mystery with what each character is about but honestly I wasn\'t too interested in exploring it prior to their episode.CharacterI found characters interesting only after we got a flashback or a call from the character of the episode.

After all, it\'s not every day you find one where nearly every major character is secretly an assassin, all of whom are targeting one of their classmates in order to have some kind of desire granted. Sadly, while it does provide a decent and entertaining action anime to sit through, ""Akuma no Riddle"" never even comes close to living up to the potential of its premise, making it an unfortunate yet all-too-common case of ""what could have been.""Story (5.5/10):""Akuma no Riddle"" is set at the fictional all-girls boarding school Myojo Academy, where 12 girls have recently...transferred and enrolled in a special class known as ""Class Black"". What very few people know, however, is that this class is actually a gathering for killers, some of whom kill as a profession and some as an act of pleasure, and are tasked with eliminating the only non-assassin Class Black student, Haru Ichinose. Each of them is given an advanced kill notice, which they must give to Haru once they decide to make a move, after which they must kill her within the next 48 hours. If they succeed, they will be granted any one desire that they can think of. One such assassin is our protagonist, Tokaku Azuma, who becomes Haru\'s roommate through sheer coincidence. Soon after, Tokaku learns that Haru is actually just as far from being an ordinary girl as anyone else in the class- specifically, she\'s been a target for assassination her entire life, with her entire immediate family having died to save her when she was just a child. What\'s more is that she knows what the other Class Black students are there for, describing Class Black as a test of hers where she must survive. Upon hearing this, Tokaku decides that she will work with Haru, not against her, becoming her protector against the rest of the class. From there, the series follows Tokaku and Haru as they defend themselves from the assassins one-by-one, with the goal of having Haru survive and ultimately graduate from Class Black.While I did enjoy most of the individual stories of each episode, particularly as you get to know each of the assassins and learn their various motivations, the actual plot leaves a ton to be desired. Now, I am generally very tolerant when it comes to characters making stupid decisions. I\'ve made more than a few myself over the years, after all. However, the sheer number of bone-headed choices made by the characters, Haru in particular, really made me want to slam my head against the wall. Considering Haru knows full well that everyone in the class except Tokaku is there to kill her, you\'d think that would give her the hint to stay away from them as much as humanly possible. Unfortunately, that is not the case, as she constantly attempts to befriend her classmates because she believes that if she can get all of them to be her friend, she can convince them to give up on killing her, and that way nobody has to die. Of course, this being an action anime about assassins, things are NEVER that simple, and so she constantly paves the way for others to trick and manipulate her, leaving her in all kinds of dire situations that could easily have been avoided if she simply thought things through. And while Tokaku is significantly smarter than Haru, and indeed doesn\'t hesitate to call her out for being foolish, she\'s not above making some bad choices herself. For example, while tearing apart her kill notice in front of all the other assassins and vowing that she\'ll protect Haru from them seems awesome on the surface, it becomes less so when you realise that it would have been smarter, not to mention more interesting, for her to turn on them in secret and pick them off from the shadows. Sure, she likely would still have been found out eventually, but it would give her a head start on them if nothing else.A smaller, but still notable, problem is that despite the fact that the series is called ""Akuma no Riddle"", the riddles Tokaku receives on a semi-regular basis ultimately have no real bearing on the actual story, and the reasoning behind them proves to be pretty anticlimactic, to say the least. I honestly didn\'t get why they were even in the series at all, since they ultimately serve no purpose other than to give the series its namesake. The story also never evolves beyond its typical ""villain of the week"" format, which it very much is despite a decent effort to appear otherwise. That means that, from beginning to end, you\'ll see Tokaku and Haru be targeted by a different assassin every episode, and watch as the class gradually shrinks with some characters leaving while others stay and get more focus. All in all, the writing has a LOT of issues and wasted potential, and ultimately the story is the last thing you should watch the series for.Art & Animation (8.5/10):“Akuma no Riddle” is a very good-looking series, which is a pleasant surprise given that Diomedea is not a particularly well-known animation studio. All the character models are very well-drawn and distinct, the environments look just as good and the fight scenes are consistently well-animated, with even the rare use of CGI being done extremely well. That said, there is an effect where background characters are greyed out with no colour, similar to that found in “Durarara!”. Nevertheless, it’s neither as noticeable or frequently used as it is there, and they at least do a decent job at making the greyed-out models look like actual people.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):“Akuma no Riddle” has a lot of things to be disappointed by, but one thing I doubt anyone will complain about is the music, which is best described as a mixture of electronic/synthetic music, orchestral music and piano music. It’s a strange combination to be sure, but that’s precisely what makes it fantastic, as it means it always has a track for any scene you can think of. The opening theme is very good, but the real standouts are the ending themes, for which there is a new one for every episode, though they vary a fair amount in quality. My personal favourites are “Paradox”, “Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow”, “Concentration”, “Poison Me”, “Escape at Midnight” and “Queen”. The voice acting is great as well, with Morgan Berry’s Tokaku being the highlight as she manages to capture the character perfectly with her low yet unmistakably feminine voice. Considering the cast also contains Colleen Clinkenbeard, Monica Rial and Alexis Tipton (the voice of Haru), Morgan Berry delivering the best performance of the bunch is definitely an accomplishment.Characters (7/10):When first introduced, Tokaku comes off as a very cynical and borderline heartless young girl, being willing to kill Haru while asking for nothing in return and answering the riddle “The world is full of ___” with “torment”, among other morbid things. By the end of the second episode, however, it becomes clear that she is anything but heartless, as she decides to go against the nature of Class Black and protect Haru from the other assassins, albeit for reasons she doesn’t quite understand. Additionally, we learn early on that despite being a supposedly master assassin who comes from an infamous and feared family of assassins, Tokaku has yet to actually kill anyone, resulting in her being derisively called a “virgin” by one of her classmates who finds out. This is due to her aunt and mother always being against her becoming an assassin like the rest of the clan, and as a result she is unable to kill even to protect herself. However, Tokaku hates this limitation, as she feels that she’s being dragged down by the demands of those who are no longer here, which is preventing her from living her own life. Unfortunately, while this does make for a rather interesting conflict, the ultimate resolution to it is less than satisfactory, and ultimately she doesn’t undergo any major growth other than gaining a true reason to live. Nevertheless, she’s still the best character in the series, being consistently likeable even with her cold exterior and more than living up to her status as a badass assassin despite her inability to kill.The other main character of the series, and my second favourite, is of course Haru Ichinose, though I definitely found myself very frustrated with her at times. While it’s a common anime trope for characters to do poorly at school but be very smart outside of it, Haru is the exact opposite- her grades are among the best in the class, yet when it comes to common sense and survival skills, she’s astoundingly lacking. Despite knowing full well what her classmates’ intentions are and Tokaku’s repeated warnings, Haru constantly lets her guard down around them and always believes the lies they tell her, no matter how obvious they are or who she’s talking to at the time. While her intentions are noble, the fact remains that the very first person who tries to kill her is an unrepentant serial killer who desires to be above the law so she can continue her killing spree forever, which should have made clear to Haru that there are people who don’t want to be your friend, aren’t worth the effort, or both. I wouldn’t have minded this so much if it was the set-up for a character arc where Haru gradually becomes less naïve and learns who to trust and who not to. Sadly, she never seems to grow or learn from any of her mistakes, with the story repeatedly bending over backwards to fit her viewpoint, which would make her tiring to deal with if her actual personality wasn’t so likeable.Besides Tokaku and Haru, there are 11 other Class Black students who serve as their opponents, making for 13 students in total. Unfortunately, most of these don’t get any real focus outside of the episode in which they’re the antagonist, with Tokaku and Haru facing a different one in each episode. While these individual episodes do a decent job at fleshing out the characters and their desires, which often say a lot about who they are as people, ultimately it takes more than just one episode for me to get truly invested in a character, resulting in a supporting cast that’s both underwhelming and underdeveloped. There’s even one who gets no focus at all, to the point that we learn pretty much nothing about her. On the other hand, there are a couple of characters that I felt got too much focus compared to others, including one who tries to kill Haru before the assassinations even officially start, yet sticks around for most of the series afterwards, even though trying to get the jump on everyone else should logically have gotten her disqualified. Besides the students, the number of notable characters can literally be counted on one hand- there’s the chairwoman of Myojo and supervisor of Class Black, Meichi Yuri, Tokaku’s trolling confidant Kaiba (no, not THAT Kaiba) and the Class Black homeroom teacher, who’s often so dense and oblivious that he makes Haru look like a genius. Overall, the cast is decent, but there’s definite room for improvement.Enjoyment (7/10):“Akuma no Riddle” is an entertaining series for sure, with a fair amount of variety in the fight scenes, but it does take a while to get to the good parts. In fact, the assassinations don’t truly start until episode 3, which doesn’t sound like a bad thing until you realise that the series is only 12 episodes long, meaning we only have 10 episodes in the actual story. The tone is also rather inconsistent, as while the backstories of the characters tend to go to some very dark places, the series itself isn’t really dark at all, making hard to know exactly what kind of story the writers were going for.Overall:“Akuma no Riddle” is definitely far from essential viewing, and those with very high standards would do well to stay away from it. Nevertheless, those who like assassin stories or just shows with strong female characters should find some enjoyment in it. If the actual story and characters were developed anywhere near as well as the visuals and music, “Akuma no Riddle” could have been a truly great anime, instead of a merely good one.Score:5.5+8.5+8.5+7+7=36.5/50=7.3/10 transferred and enrolled in a special class known as ""Class Black"".

After seeing the first couple of episodes, I began to wonder: is this going to be really smart or really dumb? The answer, as usual, is none of the above.Akuma no Riddle starts off with a simple yet intriguing premise: there are 12 assassins in the Black class and one victim. The killers, of course, need to kill her, the target wants to survive. So, after hearing this, I thought the show was opting to be mystery: you can't trust anyone, everyone is suspicious and so on. This can be done and has been...done to great success but there is one obvious and serious problem here: unlike, say, in Another, you don't have many usual people trying to find one special person; instead, only one is normal. Therefore, there is no reason for the target to check anyone, thus every suspicious or ambiguous bit of dialogue immediately exposes the character as an assassin. Handling that for 12 episodes and still maintaining the intrigue doesn't seem to be possible, and the anime wisely takes a different turn. The target is revealed very early on to everyone; instead, the hunt has rules, which basically mean everyone makes their attempts in order, and the goal is to be the first to succeed.The synopsis is a bit misleading, though: Tokaku develops feeling for Haru, sure, but not that gradually. To be honest, it comes out of nowhere, really; what surprised me is the fact that it is actually explored later on. The number of killers (12) isn't coincidental, it basically means each episode has its villain. There are deviations from this rule but it's more or less true. So, everyone gets a chance to shine, even though it means there isn't much of a coherent narrative. The only question is: is one episode always enough for the writer to make a character interesting and memorable? At first, it seems like the answer is no, first attackers are not very interesting: there are either no redeeming qualities whatsoever or they are as boring and banal as you can get. Their methods can't be called cunning, too.It does improve, though, some characters are actually compelling and easy to identify with, their resolutions well-handled. Ironically, those who actually didn't want to kill Haru all that much turned out to be most interesting. Their episodes are mostly around the mid point of the series. After that, however, the focus is more on Tokaku, Haru and their relationship rather than anyone else, so the killers serve mostly as a means for character development. As a result, they aren't that memorable but allow the leads to shine; thanks to that, Haru doesn't come out as a complete damsel in distress, and Tokaku is affected by these experiences, which makes their personalities more interesting. Which is good, since in the beginning they are more (Haru) or less (Tokaku) two-dimensional. The ending changes this radically, although it is pretty strange and, I'm certain, didn't appeal to many. It's probably happy, all things considered, but strange and surprising. I liked it, unsure as I am of how plausible the events were in terms of established relationships.The art really worked for me, it's rather unrealistic but has a sharp feeling to it, making the atmosphere seem surreal yet not exactly threatening. Overall, the show looks and feels pretty energetic, helped by the score often choosing electronic music, though also utilizing traditional instruments. I also liked the decision to make everyone except the students of the Black class black and white, it just looks awesome. The character designs are great, no one looks the same and practically no one looks generic, too. The voice acting was great, I especially liked Tokaku; the voice is unusual but works well with her.Most of my problems with the show I have already mentioned: while SOME characters I liked, some were boring or were only there to develop the leads; and one of the students is completely pointless and has little to no personality. The big revelation in the end (and of course there's the big answer to who's behind this and what do they want) is only good for the effect it has on Haru and Tokaku's relationship, it's not that interesting or surprising, for that matter, and ultimately comes out of left field and amounts to nothing. The anime, in my opinion, suffers from it only having 12 episodes; otherwise, character arcs could have been more explored, the ending built up better, so that it could make more of an impact. As it is, not everything is great with Akuma no Riddle but it is enjoyable, contains surprisingly little padding and fanservice and at least half the class consists of interesting characters. Overall, it's good. I just can't shrug off the feeling it could have been better. done to great success but there is one obvious and serious problem here: unlike, say, in Another, you don't have many usual people trying to find one special person; instead, only one is normal.

One person needs to protect someone from multiple other assassins?  Count me in.Story: Riddle Story of Devil sets us up at a school where one class of thirteen students are dubbed ""Class Black"".  Unbeknownst to their teacher, twelve trained assassins are given one objective: kill Haru Ichinose.  The person who successfully does this is given one reward of their choosing, with basically no limitation to it.  The rules?  You must give Haru your notice card, which basically means she needs...to be aware that you\'re going after her life.  After seeing this card, you have forty-eight hours to kill her.  Fail this, and you are expelled from the school.  There\'s one catch: Tokaku Azuma has decided she doesn\'t want to assassinate Haru, and thus, announces that she will be Haru\'s protector during this game.I was actually pretty interested in the plot because I thought there was going to be some pretty intense action, but the way they carry out the entire story is predictable, boring and lacking in excitement.  Each episode basically spotlights one of the girls and we get to see how they attempt to take Haru\'s life, as well as their motivation to get their wish granted.  However, after seeing one episode, you\'ve basically seen the entire series.  They don\'t attempt to mix up the formula, but instead, use each episode as a ""monster of the week"" format, and it really doesn\'t work.  You can clearly see that Tokaku and Haru have limitations to what they can do, and throughout the entire series, you never really feel like our characters go all out.The final few episodes where they reveal more details about Tokaku and Haru were fine, and probably highlight the best part of the series, but that\'s a low bar to climb.  Normally, when action series with romantic elements fail on the action side of things, I do tend to see if the relationship between interested parties at least seemed meaningful, but even here, Tokaku and Haru aren\'t anything special.  What I feel like the series wanted us to shock us about Haru\'s family\'s background, just felt flat and unsatisfying.  It wasn\'t what I would call exciting and even though we see and understand what\'s going on and why, I just couldn\'t find myself caring.  The ending, also predictable, doesn\'t feel too complete either, as there was never an attempt to solve much of anything.  (3/10)Characters: Some characters as a whole fare a little better and offer an okay mix.  Tokaku has a bit of plain background as it amounts to something along the lines of ""we\'ve been doing this thing for years, here\'s how Tokaku will follow up"".  It\'s not uncommon for some anime tropes to exist, and I\'m never against it in principle, but when you don\'t make it at least interesting, you\'ve lost me.  It really doesn\'t help that her ""abilities"" pale in comparison to the other assassins in terms of interest.  Haru has a target on her back for reasons that we found out pretty late, but her past\'s story is actually decent.  She has multiple markings on her body and it serves as a reminder of what she\'s had to go through.  Contrast that with her present day characteristics and... there isn\'t enough there.  She\'s cheerful, but doesn\'t seem to go through much character development, outside of a thing or two, here and there.  She\'s kind of useless on her own, if we\'re being honest.The other assassins are fairly unique in their fighting style, which I always respect in shows that have a decently sized cast.  Sumireko Hanabusa\'s by far the most interesting, and it\'s no coincidence that her episode was the best one.  With our side cast being decently unique, it did prevent this show from likely tanking altogether.  Their motivations for the wishes at least make sense, despite the weird setup for a few of them.  Nio, who we don\'t know much about until decently late, almost serves as the moderator for the contest, but I\'m not sure if her background\'s suppose to be creepy, or just straight up silly.  (5/10)Art: The generic art style is fine.  I actually didn\'t notice too much in a the way of decreasing quality of character models as the camera pans away from them, which does tend to show itself in some series.  What was less fine were that action scenes outside of Sumireko\'s were just... boring.  There\'s more intense scenery in the OP than most of the episodes.  This really dullens what we see on screen, considering the nature of this show.  (6/10)Sound: The OST and OP were fine with nothing terribly spectacular about either.  The EDs have a really nice mix to them... and when I say nice mix, I mean all twelve of them.  There\'s a different ED song for each episode, each sung by one of the assassins\' Japanese VAs, with the final one sung by all thirteen characters.  This obviously never happens in anime and the fact that they decided to do this is really neat.  The VO cast were really fun, with Alexis Tipton (Haru) matching her character the best while Morgan Berry (Tokaku) has a pretty unique voice and loved her here.  This was a strong showing for our cast here.  (8/10)Overall Enjoyment: Despite the decent sound quality, Riddle Story of Devil fails to meet any expectations, low or high, that I had for it.  The plot rarely keeps you guessing, it moves horribly slow and the entire show format gets stale really quick.  There\'s just other series that are out there that follow a similar format and have much better results.  (5/10) to be aware that you\'re going after her life.

I recently watched it so I thought a fresh perspective might be beneficial. Story-wise, it depends on the perspective you take. I think the low reviews come from taking the anime much more seriously than it should have been. I didn't feel like the show took itself very seriously from the beginning. They wouldn't have included some of the characters if this show was meant to be extremely serious. They wouldn't have written some of the scenes the way they did, unless it was supposed to be amusing. The yuri aspect is a bit of...a stretch. The main characters aren't seen building a relationship and the one kiss scene in the show is barely considered a kiss in the first place. I felt there was more romance between two of the supporting characters. If you're looking for a good yuri, this definitely is not that. I personally liked the art in the show. I liked the fact that each assassin got their own ending credits- except for one, but that really isn't a problem in retrospect. Now, character-wise, a lot could have been done differently. Each character had potential to be extremely interesting, but due to the duration of the series it wasn't possible to give each character extensive background. It's important to remember that they are supposed to be supporting characters, so technically it really shouldn't matter whether or not they have a background story because they aren't the ones we're supposed to be paying attention to. That being said, it is still very possible to enjoy the supporting characters with the bit of information we are given. I won't deny that I did find myself wanting more background for some of the characters, but it's understandable why that couldn't happen. Personally, I didn't like the two main characters (Tokaku Azuma and Haru Ichinose) and found myself more interested in the supporting characters. I found the series entertaining and I enjoyed it quite a bit- even with the problems mentioned beforehand. There's confusion regarding the ending of the series. A lot of viewers didn't quite understand what lead to the ending and refer to it as a cop out when that isn't necessarily the case. This is another instance of needing to pay attention to what the show is giving you. You have to actually use critical thinking skills for some parts. Overall, I rate it a 7. There are so many parts of this show that ARE likable. It's important to remember that this show isn't meant to be super duper serious. The show itself has a great amount of potential that wasn't necessarily carried out fully, but that doesn't mean that it's unwatchable. If the series was a bit longer there would have been more opportunity, which can be said for a lot of other series as well.

Di Gi Charat Christmas Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1757/Di_Gi_Charat_Christmas_Special,"[""Di Gi Charat Christmas Special was a 20-minute episode loosely based around the Christmas theme; present giving. I actually enjoyed this 1 episode more than the other specials and the 16-ep original series.Not too sure why but here goes:This special tried to include all the characters, both main and minor, into 1 story. Which worked of course as it is a Christmas-theme episode AND each character had their fair share of lines and time. There are plenty of humorous scenes and many clashes between Dejiko and Piyoko who are the real rivals of the series. There was even a short fight between them two that...involved explosions, eye lasers, mouth bazookas and a bit of evasive maneuvering. That was really fun to watch.The animations has slightly improved and the backgrounds are also slightly more detailed (yet they are still cheaply-drawn). The characters are drawn the same, so they still look a bit sloppy yet detailed. The OP music is fitting but not that enjoyable while the ED is a Christmas-themed song sang by the 3 characters Dejiko, Puchiko and Rabien Rose. Enjoyable at the very least.This special alone highlights the pros of the anime series: cuteness, fun and laughter.

Devilman Lady,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1629/Devilman_Lady,"[""This is my favourite anime of all time, and I will admit from the off, I am somewhat biased towards it. Nonetheless, I don't expect anyone reading this to go in to this anime expecting something that they themselves will give 10/10, but nonetheless, to check out this series because it is worthwhile.A quick synopsis to begin: Jun Fudo is a fashion model, who is approached by a mysterious blonde stranger named Lan Asuka. Lan brings her to a warehouse and sets a wolf demon upon Jun, who transforms into a monster herself and fights back. Jun is a Devilman, an evolved human with...great power, who has retained her human conscience.The story's comic book scenario belies an intensly deep story. There are many questions asked in regard to the nature of the human condition, and Jun herself is portrayed not as a heroine as such, again, keeping it away from descending into a comic book feel, but rather as a tool, and a weapon being manipulated in some grand scheme involving the plight of the entire human race. There are romantic elements, the story is very much yuri based, with a lot of sexual ambiguity thrown in. But it never comes across as crude. The series builds to an epic finale which is reminiscent of it's origins: a Devilman story wouldn't be a Devilman story without a truly epic and memorable ending.The series' one weakpoint is in it's animation quality. Whilst it deserves a solid score for it's design which is realistic and gritty, very true to it's setting and atmosphere, and also for having some genuinely morbid and unique mosnter designs, the smoothness of the animation is very inconsistent as is the detail. This is a low budget anime from the late 90s, and many of them suffered this. However that period is considered a golden period of anime because of how many of these shows were actually incredibly good, and Devilman Lady I think was the absolute best.Finally, the music, along with the muted pacing and design is the final piece of the puzzle to add to why this anime is so good. It's story is rich, it's characters real, and finally, it's atmosphere is absolutely palpable. Personally I feel this is just about as flawless an anime as you'll find in all but visuals. But I care less about people agreeing with that than simply giving this show more attention, which it definitely deserves, and is one of the best adaptations of Go Nagai's mangas available. great power, who has retained her human conscience.The story's comic book scenario belies an intensly deep story.

It is truly something exceptional, roughly on the level of Gunbuster and Neon Genesis Evangelion. This is a dark, tense, grim, dramatic and very interesting story that keeps escalating, and escalating and escalating and in the end it has a very small number of flaws. The anime surpassed all my expectations, and I picked it by accident.It is worth metnioning that it has very little in common with Devilman Lady manga by Go Nagai. I saw the manga, and due to standard nagai style and its age it was a bit hard to...take it seriously. Rather than copying story from the manga, however, this anime reimagines it. Characters are similar to the original, but events are different. Jun is no longer a school teacher, but a photo model, and I bet events take a very different turn.However, because it was a ""reimagining"" and not an adaptation, it suddenly turned into a masterpiece level material. From the amazing intro you get a good idea of what you\'re getting yourself into - a dark setting where everyone can die, nobody has a plot armor, and where even protagonist isn\'t safe.Due to original material, there\'s a high level of violence, there\'s sexual tension, VERY strong yuri overtones, and people get into a really bad situations all the time. So it is not a lighthearted and happy show, but rather something that can keep you on the edge of your seat. I would say it is a horror show.It is worth mentioning that anime managed to match all my interests, so I\'m probably biased. Honestly, I was awed by it, but I\'ll try to provide a detailed breakdown below:Story:The story is grim. Starting with fantastic/supernatural premise, it keeps unfolding, evolving, escalating, and going further and further to a fairly unexpected conclusion. Rather than concentrating on individual characters it feels like it shows how the world slowly change around the protagonists. The story keeps pushing tension level higher and higher, and on many occasions you\'ll be watching the show and seeing that something horrible is about to happen. Rather than shying away and averting some sort of horrible event, the script lets it happen, and you get to see the results. The thing is... it doesnt\' feel forced, unnatoral, and looks completely believable (unlike, say, Re: zero who went overboard with torture and that shattered illusion of the movie). Rather than going for the gore (as many titles do), the story focuses a lot on psychological tensions, so there are many tense, or uncomfortable moments, or situations that are scary when you think about them.In the end it is ""anyone can die"" kind of experience. Limbs can start flying, but then rather than showering you with gore, the show starts playing with your mind, and demonstrates psychologically tense moments.So all in all, it is very good. The only weakness is few issues with the main heroine (I\'ll talk about them later), and one ""flashback"" episode that appeared out of the blue and was quite weak compared to the rest of the movie. There also was one VERY predictable story turn I didn\'t really enjoy and felt like its quality was below the rest of the show.Art:It is okay. It is a quality 90s animation, on lower level than Shin Cutie Honey was, but nevertheless it is very detailed. Monsters are well drawn, but a lot of scenes happen in the dark (meaning you don\'t get to see muhch), and there were few (meaning one or two) occurrences where cels and scenes were reused near the end. I suppose the studio either briefly had budget problems, or were gathering resources for the finale.It may be worth mentioning that there\'s less nudity compared to original (for example, devil lady is slightly censored), but still it happens plenty of time.Sound:Music is magnificent, I loved it. Intro song has amazing gothic feeling to it, and music matches the show very well. The composer was pretty much a genius. IT is worth mentioning, that due to the gothic feeling about it, the soundtrack is fairly unusual. It is not a standard anime music by any means, regardless of the anime epoch. Then again I wish music like was used more often.Character:Characters have overarching motives that go throughought the show, and are fairly believable. However, in theory they could be portrayed better. Main heroine can be extremely annoying at ties, due to her impossibly meek nature. However, anime spends a lot of time concentrating on side characters (that tend to die quickly), and in those scenes it shines. I think it sorta reminded me of Hell Girl or maybe xxxholic in its structure - because quite a lot of episodes indirectly revolves aroudn someone else\'s story.Enjoyment:Absolutely amazing. I did not expect it to be this good and enjoyed majority of it. There were few issues where quality took a brief dip, but final events made it all worth it.Overall:It is a must-see anime. The only reason why you\'d want to avoid it, is if you don\'t like dark titles, terrifying/tense events, violence, sexually tense moments (can\'t pick a better word for this), or ""anyone can die"" scenarios. It is not a light hearted show. But it is a very good one.Definitely check it out. take it seriously. Rather than copying story from the manga, however, this anime reimagines it. Characters are similar to the original, but events are different. Jun is no longer a school teacher, but a photo model, and I bet events take a very different turn.However, because it was a ""reimagining"" and not an adaptation, it suddenly turned into a masterpiece level material. From the amazing intro you get a good idea of what you\'re getting yourself into - a dark setting where everyone can die, nobody has a plot armor, and where even protagonist isn\'t safe.Due to original material, there\'s a high level of violence, there\'s sexual tension, VERY strong yuri overtones, and people get into a really bad situations all the time. So it is not a lighthearted and happy show, but rather something that can keep you on the edge of your seat. I would say it is a horror show.It is worth mentioning that anime managed to match all my interests, so I\'m probably biased. Honestly, I was awed by it, but I\'ll try to provide a detailed breakdown below:Story:The story is grim.

Unlike said beasts however, Jun is capable of maintaining her human psyche when she transforms into Devil Lady and doesn’t harm humans. A secret military organization led by Lan Asuka tasks Jun with trying to deal with the devil beast threat under threat of being hunted by the organization herself. With...Jun trying to mentally adjust to her circumstances, factions among both humanity and the devil beasts form to each accomplish their own ends and which Jun becomes entangled in.Before I cover my thoughts on Devil Lady, I do want to make it clear that I have yet to read the manga source material for this series. I have some basic understanding of what got changed up between the manga and anime researching on it with changes to the backgrounds and personalities of major characters, plus the manga dabbling more heavily into the supernatural. But as I haven’t followed the manga too thoroughly, I am only going to be evaluating the anime on its own merits and not making any criticisms for what may be different from the manga series.Devil Lady seems to go the psychological horror with its storytelling, mixed between exploring the mental toll that being a devil beast has on Jun and the various devil beasts terrorizing the human populace. The human drama with Jun makes for the most engaging element of the series with our lead character trying to sort out the effect that being a devil beast has on her personal life and mental state, particularly when helping Asuka and her organization gets in the way of her personal relationships and career as a supermodel. While initially hesitant with accepting her situation, Jun gradually gains more confidence in herself as she comes to learn more of the inner workings in the conflict between humans and devil beasts and her willpower tested as she loses loved ones and becomes ostracized from humans due to her true nature as a devil beast. The anime also takes time to explore side characters with personal relationships with Jun whom show varying levels of concern for her well-being as they deal with the sudden changes in her behavior and personality.Other elements of Devil Lady’s storytelling are a bit more hit-and-miss. The first half of the series is mainly told in a “monster of the week” style format with Jun fighting off enemy devil beasts, many of whom being rather over-the-top with their evil acts in spite of some rather creative and creepy beast designs to compliment the anime’s horror focus. As a result, it does take time for the anime’s plot to pick up steam beyond its focus on Jun. Not to mention for whatever reason, devil beasts can usually demonstrate the power to grow into giants during battle, which adds some unnecessary hokiness to the story. The second half of the series has the plot picking up with the existence of devil beasts becoming known to the public, more nefarious motives with Asuka coming to light, and a group of devil beasts forming to try wiping out humanity. The devil beast group plot is nothing too compelling as the faction is rather shallow as far as villains go. The public’s increased awareness of devil beasts and the motives of Asuka make for the more compelling developments of Devil Lady’s second half as they force Jun into finding things in her life no longer being normal as they like and setting up some rather shocking plot twists with what Asuka is plotting with the human and devil beast conflict.Just as a fair warning, Devil Lady comes packed with the high amount of gory violence, nudity, and sexual content you’d typically come across from many Go Nagai works. While the series does still take things quite seriously with its plot compared to many of Nagai’s titles, I’d still keep this away from younger or sensitive audiences because of the good amount of graphic content offered up from this series.I guess overall, I find my thoughts of Devil Lady to be a mixed bag. The potential for serious plot development is there with the anime’s exploration of Jun’s developments coming to grips with her nature as a devil beast and some of the major plot developments in the show’s second half have their shocking twists offered up, particularly Asuka’s motives and the existence of devil beasts becoming known to the public. However, a number of the anime’s plot elements are rather over-the-top or shallow, and do usually take away from the serious storytelling that Devil Lady tries to push for. Fans of Go Nagai’s work looking for something a bit more mature-minded with its storytelling may be tempted to check out Devil Lady, but it still has its issues that keep it from being among the more better quality 1990s anime in my eyes.

The show is just as serious and action-packed as others within its genre, with a gothic opening sequence and gruesome monsters-of-the-day. Yet, it still takes time to be reflective and introspective, allowing characters and plots to shine through.The main character, Jun, questions her own existence as Devilman Lady and attempts to continue her normal life despite her superhuman abilities. The tie-in between the monsters and Jun's personal life adds depth to the plot. There are moments where the show becomes cheesy, such as the unrealistic giant battles and the over-emphasis on the monster-as-physical-manifestation-of-sin angle. Yet, the...well-written material shines through, making the cheese bearable.The animation style is not top-of-the-line, but it does the job. The character designs are particularly noteworthy, as they avoid making Jun look like a man. They also managed to make Jun really attractive, at least to my eyes.While not the best anime in its genre, Devil Lady is a solid and intelligent action series that prioritizes suspense and characterization over mindless action. Fans looking for non-stop action may be disappointed, but those desiring a well-rounded plot will find Devil Lady satisfying.

However, I was a bit disappointed with how the show ended."", 'The narrative in ""Devilman Lady"" is too much of a prototypical brain baby, basically, it\'s an idea that couldn\'t really take root. And I don\'t blame any of the staff for its failings, they did the best they could with the original source material. It must have been a challenge to make an age-appropriate product out of comic that I dropped after the first chapter, because there was nothing but gruesome rape scenes and pedophilia. Everything obscene that you could possibly imagine was in the first chapter of the manga! So, to try and then adapt it into a more distinguished product, is just insane!⚠️...This review of Devilman Lady will contain spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersAs stated in the opening paragraph, the manga completely disgusted me! I never thought that something as utterly repulsive as the ""troll scene"" in Kentarō Miura\'s ""Berserk"" look like child\'s play! It\'s difficult enough to be a MAN and be a diehard Gō Nagai fan, but to be a woman and read all of his works, requires a proclivity towards self-hatred. ""Why,"" I asked myself after being traumatized by the first chapter of the manga, ""does the female character in Devilman have to be sexually assaulted by a demon to gain her powers? Why does Akira turn into Devilman after attending a disco?"" Luckily, there\'s only one rape ※scene that comes to mind in the anime, and it isn\'t shown in graphic detail.※If you still plan to watch it, but are triggered by those types of scenes, it happens at the end of Episode 25: ""God"" (神).This series got a running start for me, it was stoking my nostalgia, giving me ""Boogiepop Phantom"" vibes! Everything was good. I liked the dynamic that the protagonist, Jun Fudō, had with her domineering compatriot, Ran Asuka. I\'m a little girl on the inside, so the ""monster-of-the-week"" theme was never a real detractor! It was always, like, what neat design is this creature going to have in the next episode, will it be spooky? What powers will it have? Will it use them to deceive humans? (etc.)If a core cast in strong enough, this formula can be used as a lens for the audience to watch a character develop, that is otherwise veiled in mystery, or to see the growth of someone just coming into their powers, and watch how they will react to an onslaught of threats. With the tragic deaths of a couple of people that were close to Jun, it works well with creating an element of suspense in one or two episodes. But, the central bulk of the series felt like there was just a checklist of demons that they needed to mark off, with no real development between Jun and Ran (or even individually).The biggest twist is when Ran reprises Ryō Asuka\'s role as Satan and betrays Jun. But, that just seems like an echo of similarities and references to Ryō\'s rise to prominence, in the manga. There\'s nothing fresh about this series, it\'s just a collection of tired clichés, but with demon-fighting lesbians! The excuse you would have to watch this series is a) if you\'re an insanely obsessed ""Devilman"" fan, like I used to be, or b) you don\'t care about the narrative, you just want something with a certain aesthetic and a gothic mood!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Toshiki Hirano (director), notable works:* Angel Heart* Baki* Bōken!

Though I wasn\'t a fan of the ""Devilman Lady"" anime, I really have to applaud the animation staff for making it much more palatable than the manga, which is... as I have mentioned before, just porn! Some of the framing and angling of certain scenes make them lean on being an aesthetic lavish, though the story is a hot mess; one of strongest displays of his talents (as a director) was during the climax of Aoi Kurosaki\'s arc: ""Shark"" (鮫). That episode was both injected with auteurism and it also made me want to curl up under a warm blanket, with my feet snug in a pair of fluffy slippers!

Rest in peace, Ms. Shimamura, even though you had a small window of time to shine in the industry — you will always be commemorated through your work as Ran Asuka!Kazusa Murai as Kazumi Takiura, notable roles:* Chiharu Nitta, Boys Be...* Nemu, Haibane Renmei ✅✅* Marina, Pokémon (series)* Ribbon-chan (""Bijou""), Tottoko Hamtarō ✅✅Commentary: I thought that Jun Fudō\'s supermodel rival, Kazumi Takiura, was the weakest link in the main cast. But, regardless, of a character that is shallow as a kiddie pool... Ms. Murai has a really cute voice, therefore the surplus character is forgettable, but tolerable. Great job!This series had a lot of promise, going into the first few episodes, but my excitement waned when everything fell away, into a slushy slog of monotony! That\'s a legitimate issue with more ""old school"" Japanese animation titles that I don\'t hear talked about too often, with full-length series, they would often dump a lot of money into animating the first volume (or two) of a collection, and then the production team would get lazy, because the consumers had already shelled out $30, even up to 100,000¥ (around $92 USD), per volume! That\'s the upside to streaming, if corners are cut in a production, the fans will usually have more of an option to boycott a studio or will stop supporting the franchise. There\'s more variety, so it isn\'t how it used to be, where people would just settle with whatever cool thing they could grab off the shelf! ""Devilman Lady"" is something that you would get stoked to find at a video rental store and watch during a stormy weekend, more atmosphere than actual staying power in its story, and because of the flaws outweighing the positive aspects, I rate the ""Devil Lady"" TV series a 3/10!Rating: ★★☆☆☆ This review of Devilman Lady will contain spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersAs stated in the opening paragraph, the manga completely disgusted me! I never thought that something as utterly repulsive as the ""troll scene"" in Kentarō Miura\'s ""Berserk"" look like child\'s play! It\'s difficult enough to be a MAN and be a diehard Gō Nagai fan, but to be a woman and read all of his works, requires a proclivity towards self-hatred. ""Why,"" I asked myself after being traumatized by the first chapter of the manga, ""does the female character in Devilman have to be sexually assaulted by a demon to gain her powers? Why does Akira turn into Devilman after attending a disco?"" Luckily, there\'s only one rape ※scene that comes to mind in the anime, and it isn\'t shown in graphic detail.※If you still plan to watch it, but are triggered by those types of scenes, it happens at the end of Episode 25: ""God"" (神).This series got a running start for me, it was stoking my nostalgia, giving me ""Boogiepop Phantom"" vibes! Everything was good. I liked the dynamic that the protagonist, Jun Fudō, had with her domineering compatriot, Ran Asuka. I\'m a little girl on the inside, so the ""monster-of-the-week"" theme was never a real detractor! It was always, like, what neat design is this creature going to have in the next episode, will it be spooky? What powers will it have? Will it use them to deceive humans? (etc.)If a core cast in strong enough, this formula can be used as a lens for the audience to watch a character develop, that is otherwise veiled in mystery, or to see the growth of someone just coming into their powers, and watch how they will react to an onslaught of threats. With the tragic deaths of a couple of people that were close to Jun, it works well with creating an element of suspense in one or two episodes. But, the central bulk of the series felt like there was just a checklist of demons that they needed to mark off, with no real development between Jun and Ran (or even individually).The biggest twist is when Ran reprises Ryō Asuka\'s role as Satan and betrays Jun. But, that just seems like an echo of similarities and references to Ryō\'s rise to prominence, in the manga. There\'s nothing fresh about this series, it\'s just a collection of tired clichés, but with demon-fighting lesbians! The excuse you would have to watch this series is a) if you\'re an insanely obsessed ""Devilman"" fan, like I used to be, or b) you don\'t care about the narrative, you just want something with a certain aesthetic and a gothic mood!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Toshiki Hirano (director), notable works:* Angel Heart* Baki* Bōken!

Iczer-1 ✅Commentary: Though, many of Mr. Hirano\'s shows are middling, I\'ll give it to the man — he sure knows how to create a mood, if we compare it to his work on the ※""Kyūketsuhime Miyu"" franchise and the ""Tatakae!! Iczer-1"" chronicles, the milieu is more on the gothic side! Though I wasn\'t a fan of the ""Devilman Lady"" anime, I really have to applaud the animation staff for making it much more palatable than the manga, which is... as I have mentioned before, just porn! Some of the framing and angling of certain scenes make them lean on being an aesthetic lavish, though the story is a hot mess; one of strongest displays of his talents (as a director) was during the climax of Aoi Kurosaki\'s arc: ""Shark"" (鮫). That episode was both injected with auteurism and it also made me want to curl up under a warm blanket, with my feet snug in a pair of fluffy slippers! From what I have seen of his filmography, even if his animations aren\'t considered ""good"" all the time, they always have a unique, artistic flair to them. I would dive into his catalog, if you\'re itching for a stylish horror show!※Interesting Tidbit: The director of both the OVA and TV series of Kyūketsuhime Miyu"" (or ""Vampire Princess Miyu"") is married to the creator of the series, Narumi Kakinōchi!Chiaki Konaka (※script — eps 1 to 5, 8, 12, 18, 25 to 26), notable works:* Air Gear* Alice in Cyberland* Armitage III ✅* Astro Boy: Tetsuwan Atom (eps 1 to 3, 14)* Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 (eps 1 to 8, 11 to 12, 15 to 16, 19 to 20, 23 to 26)* Digimon Adventure 02 (ep 13) ✅* Digimon Tamers (eps 1 to 3, 7, 13 to 14, 23 to 24, 34 to 35, 41, 44 to 45, 49 to 51) ✅* Fushigi Mahō Fun Fun Pharmacy* Futari Ecchi* GR: Giant Robo* Hellsing (eps 1 to 6, 8 to 9, 11 to 13) ✅* Inuki Kanako Zekkyō Collection: Gakkō ga Kowai!* Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World — Byōki no Kuni — For You* Kōkyōshihen Eureka Seven (eps 16, 30)* Kyūketsuhime Miyu (TV) — ep 20 ✅* Mahōtsukai Tai!

Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt (""Catnapped"")Commentary: Mr. Konaka is very prolific for his thought-provoking scripts, his insignia is left all over the episode titles — the single-symboled morphemes, like ""Beast"" (獣) and ""Blood"" (血), bring to mind the eerily uttered title cards from ""Serial Experiments Lain"" (i.e. ""Weird"" and ""Psyche""). While I am not the biggest fan of every single thing that he\'s work on, most of the series the he\'s done innocuous episodes for, like ""RahXephon"" and ""Hellsing"", has made me scratch my chin and say, ""So, that\'s why those were my favorite episodes!"" Incredible script writer, I hope that he and Yoshitoshi ABe are able to resume the production of ""Despera"" in the near future!※The two other script writers were Kenji Konuta (script for ""Aoharu x Kikanjū"") and Keiichi Hasegawa (script for ""SSSS.Gridman"").Good Seiyū Work = ✅Really Enjoyed the Seiyū\'s Performance = ✅ ✅One of Luna\'s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅ ✅ ✅Junko Iwao as Jun Fudō (or ""Devilman Lady""), notable roles:* Ceres, Ayashi no Ceres ✅* Valencia Tachibana, Blue Seed 2* Tomoya Daidōji, Cardcaptor Sakura (series) ✅✅✅* Hikari Amagi, Chō Kōsoku Gran Doll ✅✅✅* Kaizō Katsu, Katte no Kaizō* Tokiko Mima (""Key""), Key the Metal Idol ✅✅✅* Sally S.

Digimon Universe: Appli Monsters,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33314/Digimon_Universe__Appli_Monsters,"[""soo this is it...the final episode of appmon...for all the series i became very impressed and i love every single thing they did:the cgi,the characters,the semi reboot...first of all, from july of 2016 i just begin to hate digimon,after 20 years consuming everything they did, but allways felling something like “this is fine but it’s not what i expected for a cybernetic life form story”, and for all this big mess this franchise became. But them, one month ago i simply whant to go back after see some applimon scenes and the openings(koji wada can rest in piece if all the songs have this quality).i...just yelled at myself “FINALY DIGIMON IS TRULLY DIGIMON”, i mean isn’t so hard to make an actually digital world not an magic alternitve world with some creatures, they are trully based on digital things...THEY ARE APPS, FOR GOD SAKE.they recreate all a new system of categories(not as only data,vacine,and virus), and even new levels and we can trully see the difference between the levels only for the size of each one(standard appmon are small and cute, while god appmon have the size of skycreepers). I know savers tried to make it but sometimes this became ridiculous(like tailmon and meikoomon being the same level as greymon but having the size of a child), this make a refferece of “the more powerfull the app is,higher will be ”.And for the first time the fusions are something good (not something random like jureymon+megadramon=deathmon) but nothing so idiot like jogress of 02 or the digixros (they are just pieces of each other together e-e and pls don't talk of shakkoumon) , i mean they have a real grace in their fusions(EX: gatchmon(google)+navimon(an gps app)=dogatchmon(google maps).the digimons,like xros wars did too, are real characters in there not for only being the fighting source, they are all very charismatic and it’s impossible to hate one of them...specially offmon(you need to have no soul to do that e-e).it’s not perfect of course, sometimes they just put some situations to make the plot going but, for all what i have see, i can say for sure this is my favorite digimon series ever, and if you read all of this, i need to thank you because i love digimon so much but i see my favorite franchise drowning on the mud , and it’s very sad but this series,even if don’t have anything to do with the main series, simply gave me hope that digimon can be good. Again thanks appmon for remaking me love digimon just yelled at myself “FINALY DIGIMON IS TRULLY DIGIMON”, i mean isn’t so hard to make an actually digital world not an magic alternitve world with some creatures, they are trully based on digital things...THEY ARE APPS, FOR GOD SAKE.they recreate all a new system of categories(not as only data,vacine,and virus), and even new levels and we can trully see the difference between the levels only for the size of each one(standard appmon are small and cute, while god appmon have the size of skycreepers).

Again thanks appmon for remaking me love digimon"", 'I will update my review once the series ends (at ep 16). I am committed to finishing this series as it\'s part of the Digimon franchise. So my critique is as a Digimon fan but also as how this series stands on its own since it diverts from Digimon norm and blatantly is about \'AppMon\' and not \'Digimon.\' (Note there is an Appli Drive and not Digivice, Deep Web and not Digital World.)First of all let\'s talk about the overall impression I\'ve seen people compare it to: Digimon meets Yu-Gi-Oh and Yokai Watch. And... so far that is accurate in terms of designs and some...aspects like: AppMon can be \'summoned\' through the Appli Drive using their corresponding App Chips (like cards) and \'realize\' into being, much like Duel Disk and cards in Yu-Gi-Oh. Plus clearly the creators are so fair treating this as a \'game\' via terminology from \'main character\' to \'final boss.\' Oh and this takes place in 2045.Now to be fair folks: This is Digimon Universe, it takes place within the Digimon existence but these creatures are basically Digimon cousins. These AIs are data but not Digimon, living solely in phone apps until they get an App Chip that can be used to realize them through the Appli Drive. So far this show has shown it\'s heavy with comedy via embarrassment, gags, repeated shots, slap-stick or comedic timing, sure to get darker as the true villain of the show comes into play, but for sure light-hearted because it\'s obviously for kids!ART:The main character only looks like a typical Digimon main character via his goggles (exception being Digimon Savers/Data Squad). Everyone else reminds me of designs seen in typical card game anime (I\'m looking at you Cardfight!! Vanguard Card and Yu-Gi-Oh) and even some of the Megaman animes. (For those wondering what I\'m talking about: crazy hair, unnatural hair colors and blinding colored outfits. No one in any of the past Digimon seasons has had \'natural\' green or pink hair. (Mimi from Adventure was even noted to have dyed it and then switched back)) The show is full of bright colors, though the AppMon designs are interesting which is good and sometimes... simple/???? Some designs are the same just recolored (even made fun of in show by going ""Are you two related?"" ""No, we just look alike"" despite familiarity with one another) As of episode 6 they reused a Digimon design as an AppMon so, questions there if they\'re going to borrow more designs. Also they reuse some Digimon names for new characters/designs unrelated to the original versions from previous series (Raidramon). The fusions of the Appmon are done in CG which either can look borderline cool or gaudy.We have our one female main character, pink-haired Eri, who a pop star (appears in episode 5), and our spotlight goggle boy Haru and another male character Torajirou ""Astra"" who is an internet celebrity (appears in episode 7), forming a trio with a shady fourth character, Rei who is an edgy/mysterious lone wolf with his own agenda (Rei and Hackmon appear at the end of ep 3, officially debuting to the others in ep 9). Out of the human designs, Rei is the least cringe worthy of outfit colors in my opinion, he wears black unlike his other blindingly clad co-stars.PREMISE:Most episodes so far deals with an infected Appmon causing chaos. Appmon reside in mobile apps and act accordingly (messenger Appmon deals with IMs, GPS Appmon for navigation apps, etc); when infected by the L virus they become unstable and the one causing the virus, to quote Gatchmon, is \'the final boss, a sinister artificial intelligence: Leviathan.\' In order to stop the out of control AI from causing trouble Haru has to team up with Gatchmon to stop it and its minions, like Cameramon. Using the power of the Appli Drive Gatchmon can achieve super forms to take down the enemy by combining/fusing with ally Appmon. It is revealed in ep 3 there are ""7 Codes Appmon"" with a special code within them that can fight against Leviathan and Haru needs all 7. (This is reminiscent of any Digimon show, a small time villain/challenge per episode before working up to bigger threats. Also the classic \'infected by a virus/controlled by higher and corrupt power\' is classic of the Digimon franchise)Apparently there is one Appmon per app program not per app download, they are one of a kind and can hop to the same function type app as long as it\'s on someone\'s device (ie: any GPS app, any IM app). (THOUGH this is questionable as in ep 3 we see many Roleplaymon via flashback, though he was the AppMon of a specific RPG) Also Appmon via their appli chips can be combined together through ""Appli Link"" and then a much stronger ""Appli Fusion,"" much like what Digimon fans have seen in Xros Wars/Fusion. Appli Link = power boost and combined look similar to Digimon Xros Wars/Fusion, while Appli Fusion is more like DNA evolution seen in Adventure 02 where two compatible Mons become a new entity in form completely, none of this \'added feature/combined like Voltron.\' These forms are called ""Super Appmon."" Also to engage these rogue Appmon Haru enters an AR Field, much like the Quartz Zone from Digimon Xros Wars Season 3 (Hunters). It should be noted that Appli Fusion can fail though, resulting in a wrong and weak fusion.In episode 3 it is revealed Appli Fusions are done in CGI, which even Haru remarks \'wow he even looks CG!\' (I am not kidding). So you have a CGI Appmon on screen w/ 2D characters, something that isn\'t uncommon in anime now a days or anyone familiar with early 2000s+ shows. Thankfully it doesn\'t look too out of place but might take some getting used to from jumping from seeing CG digivolutions to CG forms actually fight non-CG forms.CHARACTER:At this point any info about characters we want to know is revealed mainly through Gatchmon via his magnifying glass because he\'s a search app and can look up any info; he\'s this show\'s \'Data Collection/Digimon Database\' to provide the viewer insight. *Gatchmon, AppMon of Search Engines, is a curious Appmon who is starry-eyed about the Real World given he only recently exited the internet; he has a ""go get \'em\' attitude"" and supportive of his human buddy. *Haru is suppose to be an introvert with only one best friend and loves books but that so far is only made known via other characters, but he\'s seen to be very studious with research and pleasure reading. He\'s a low key guy who \'sees himself as a side character\' and doesn\'t want to stand out, but when prompted by the the Appli Drive and Gatchmon Haru decides he is in fact a \'main character\' and becomes more assertive, especially when it comes to the stopping the infected AppMon. (By the end of episode 1, episode 2 he\'s out of the gate to look for his crush and stop the rogue Appmon.) *Eri using her \'idol persona\' is a bit eccentric, haughty, and spouts catchphrases (I\'ll punch my way into your heart!) but can be calm, awkward and unsure since she\'s new to AppMon (despite having an AppDrive 6 months before Haru); she\'s part of an idol group that\'s obviously inspired by AKB48 (she\'s member #470). *Dokumon, AppMon of Action Games, and Eri\'s buddy is a loudmouth but earnest and loyal AppMon who just wants to see people smile. *Torajirou ""Astra"" is an energetic and almost impulsive kid who is an AppTuber star who spouts ""Will I? Or won\'t I?"" catchphrases as he can be eccentric in his videos as an escapism from his obligation to be his family successor. *Musimon, AppMon of Music Players, is supportive and energetic like his human partner, often saying ""No Musimon, no life!"" and looks for the music in one\'s heart.For the record Eri and Astra are eccentric but can be calm, but they contrast Haru with their quirky star personas and huge star egos. (So far Rei\'s brief appearances have been shady and foreboding.)SOUNDThe music can get funky at times and rather repetitive. Especially when doing the Appli Link, the voice goes over and over again and there\'s this sorta clap beat when it happens. Not to mention it gets a sorta eurobeat as the voice starts to get sped up to the point of sounding warped and high: App Link! GACCHI! GACCHI! GA-GA-GA-GACCHI. (Note this happens for all the Appmon, like DOKA! DOKA!) Otherwise there isn\'t much of a soundtrack past the action sequences and the opening and ending. So far it\'s only been during App Realize, Appli Link and Appli Fusion. All with the overly dramatic voice that says English words oddly like ATTENSHION PLEEEEZ~ENJOYMENTIf you stop comparing it to past Digimon Seasons (which can be hard given it has the Digimon name in it and if you\'re like me and seen all the seasons), it looks like it can be an enjoyable show to just kill time. I wouldn\'t bank on a ton of character development but one can hope or else this is just \'come as you are for an adventure\' type deal. The main character Haru doesn\'t really standout but can relate to anyone who feels average, just blending in and not standing out. Hopefully given his choice to change to be more proactive in episode 1 is actually impactful; but given we only had like 5 minutes to see his former self before being throw into the Appmon drama and finally make his choice in the end, that might be hard. Also we have a sibling situation reused from Digimon Fusion/Xros Wars which gives one character their motivation to act and act the way they do; which is points down from me since that was just used in the last Digimon series.OVERALL: So if you look at the basics: Kid/boy meets AI made of data, gets device to symbolize and empower partnership, helps AI partner grow stronger via higher/combined forms, fights opposing AI forces (and some humans), saves our/real world AND digital/AI world... you got the typical Digimon set up. Just toss in some non traditional designs, different species and characters, and hip if not questionably annoying music/sound effects and you\'ve got a new show. The tone and silliness of the show clearly show who the target audience is from ages 6-11, the young Millennials since the main Appmon human cast is basically a Youtube star and a young Japanese pop singer and the one who\'s ""ordinary"" (meant to be the viewer\'s intro into the series/world as just a normal person becoming extraordinary) and then the brooding hacker who stands on his own. There is some drama but nothing like in previous series that had light moments and darker, this so far (as of ep 15) it\'s just ""silly and light"", ""background bad guy"", ""minor accidental opponents"", ""one of us is aware of the real threat but doesn\'t always show up"" and ""something sinister is a foot but meanwhile we\'ll deal with malfunctioning apps causing havoc while looking for a way to stop the bad AI, Leviathan."" aspects like: AppMon can be \'summoned\' through the Appli Drive using their corresponding App Chips (like cards) and \'realize\' into being, much like Duel Disk and cards in Yu-Gi-Oh. Plus clearly the creators are so fair treating this as a \'game\' via terminology from \'main character\' to \'final boss.\' Oh and this takes place in 2045.Now to be fair folks: This is Digimon Universe, it takes place within the Digimon existence but these creatures are basically Digimon cousins.

Appli Link = power boost and combined look similar to Digimon Xros Wars/Fusion, while Appli Fusion is more like DNA evolution seen in Adventure 02 where two compatible Mons become a new entity in form completely, none of this \'added feature/combined like Voltron.\' These forms are called ""Super Appmon."" Also to engage these rogue Appmon Haru enters an AR Field, much like the Quartz Zone from Digimon Xros Wars Season 3 (Hunters). It should be noted that Appli Fusion can fail though, resulting in a wrong and weak fusion.In episode 3 it is revealed Appli Fusions are done in CGI, which even Haru remarks \'wow he even looks CG!\' (I am not kidding). So you have a CGI Appmon on screen w/ 2D characters, something that isn\'t uncommon in anime now a days or anyone familiar with early 2000s+ shows. Thankfully it doesn\'t look too out of place but might take some getting used to from jumping from seeing CG digivolutions to CG forms actually fight non-CG forms.CHARACTER:At this point any info about characters we want to know is revealed mainly through Gatchmon via his magnifying glass because he\'s a search app and can look up any info; he\'s this show\'s \'Data Collection/Digimon Database\' to provide the viewer insight. *Gatchmon, AppMon of Search Engines, is a curious Appmon who is starry-eyed about the Real World given he only recently exited the internet; he has a ""go get \'em\' attitude"" and supportive of his human buddy. *Haru is suppose to be an introvert with only one best friend and loves books but that so far is only made known via other characters, but he\'s seen to be very studious with research and pleasure reading. He\'s a low key guy who \'sees himself as a side character\' and doesn\'t want to stand out, but when prompted by the the Appli Drive and Gatchmon Haru decides he is in fact a \'main character\' and becomes more assertive, especially when it comes to the stopping the infected AppMon. (By the end of episode 1, episode 2 he\'s out of the gate to look for his crush and stop the rogue Appmon.) *Eri using her \'idol persona\' is a bit eccentric, haughty, and spouts catchphrases (I\'ll punch my way into your heart!) but can be calm, awkward and unsure since she\'s new to AppMon (despite having an AppDrive 6 months before Haru); she\'s part of an idol group that\'s obviously inspired by AKB48 (she\'s member #470). *Dokumon, AppMon of Action Games, and Eri\'s buddy is a loudmouth but earnest and loyal AppMon who just wants to see people smile. *Torajirou ""Astra"" is an energetic and almost impulsive kid who is an AppTuber star who spouts ""Will I? Or won\'t I?"" catchphrases as he can be eccentric in his videos as an escapism from his obligation to be his family successor. *Musimon, AppMon of Music Players, is supportive and energetic like his human partner, often saying ""No Musimon, no life!"" and looks for the music in one\'s heart.For the record Eri and Astra are eccentric but can be calm, but they contrast Haru with their quirky star personas and huge star egos. (So far Rei\'s brief appearances have been shady and foreboding.)SOUNDThe music can get funky at times and rather repetitive. Especially when doing the Appli Link, the voice goes over and over again and there\'s this sorta clap beat when it happens. Not to mention it gets a sorta eurobeat as the voice starts to get sped up to the point of sounding warped and high: App Link! GACCHI! GACCHI! GA-GA-GA-GACCHI. (Note this happens for all the Appmon, like DOKA! DOKA!) Otherwise there isn\'t much of a soundtrack past the action sequences and the opening and ending. So far it\'s only been during App Realize, Appli Link and Appli Fusion. All with the overly dramatic voice that says English words oddly like ATTENSHION PLEEEEZ~ENJOYMENTIf you stop comparing it to past Digimon Seasons (which can be hard given it has the Digimon name in it and if you\'re like me and seen all the seasons), it looks like it can be an enjoyable show to just kill time. I wouldn\'t bank on a ton of character development but one can hope or else this is just \'come as you are for an adventure\' type deal. The main character Haru doesn\'t really standout but can relate to anyone who feels average, just blending in and not standing out. Hopefully given his choice to change to be more proactive in episode 1 is actually impactful; but given we only had like 5 minutes to see his former self before being throw into the Appmon drama and finally make his choice in the end, that might be hard. Also we have a sibling situation reused from Digimon Fusion/Xros Wars which gives one character their motivation to act and act the way they do; which is points down from me since that was just used in the last Digimon series.OVERALL: So if you look at the basics: Kid/boy meets AI made of data, gets device to symbolize and empower partnership, helps AI partner grow stronger via higher/combined forms, fights opposing AI forces (and some humans), saves our/real world AND digital/AI world... you got the typical Digimon set up. Just toss in some non traditional designs, different species and characters, and hip if not questionably annoying music/sound effects and you\'ve got a new show. The tone and silliness of the show clearly show who the target audience is from ages 6-11, the young Millennials since the main Appmon human cast is basically a Youtube star and a young Japanese pop singer and the one who\'s ""ordinary"" (meant to be the viewer\'s intro into the series/world as just a normal person becoming extraordinary) and then the brooding hacker who stands on his own. There is some drama but nothing like in previous series that had light moments and darker, this so far (as of ep 15) it\'s just ""silly and light"", ""background bad guy"", ""minor accidental opponents"", ""one of us is aware of the real threat but doesn\'t always show up"" and ""something sinister is a foot but meanwhile we\'ll deal with malfunctioning apps causing havoc while looking for a way to stop the bad AI, Leviathan.""', ""Appmon is one of those rare anime that comes along every once in a while. Where at first glance, you're already going to love it, or you're going to hate it. Whether it be because you're a longtime digimon fan who doesn't want change, or just because you're not a fan of its childish, bright and colorful art style, it's hard to go in with an unbiased mind. But I feel like if you're going in with the understanding of what the show is meant to be, and not what you desire, it's an absolute masterpiece in ever sense of the word.Some people compare it...to Digimon meets Yokai Watch with a sprinkle of kamen rider, and I couldn't agree more. It's without a doubt designed to be for a much younger audience than previous seasons. I wouldn't exactly call this a bad thing, but I could see how this could push a few people away. However, that doesn't stop the show from having some shockingly dark moments, most of which occur when the show is reaching it's climax.A lot of characters go through deep and extensive character arcs and it's really interesting seeing them grow as people over the course of the series. The characters of this show is definitely it's strong point. It's very rare when you get an entire cast this likable where you want whats best for everybody by the end. Even characters I found annoying in the beginning I ended up loving by the end. I really feel like there's a character for everybody here.The story on the other hand, is difficult to talk about. Not because it's good or bad, but because it takes a while to get going. The first half of the show is really just build up and feels like filler, but once it starts, as said before, it really gets going. It dives into some reason life problems, some of which you wouldn't expect a children's anime to tackle, but it does so beautifully. It really uses it's younger demographic as an advantage to try something new for the digimon series.The show also doesn't go out of it's way to hide it's plot twists. You find out who the main villain is because the heroes do, you now what traps are waiting up ahead, you know who the traitor is, etc. but it uses these twists to it's advantage in very clever ways. You know these twists are going to happen, but you never know when or why which really allows the viewer to get in the characters heads.Art is good. Sometimes there are episodes that look a bit off, but that's to be expected in a 50+ anime series. The art is never so bad that it looks ugly so that's nothing to worry about.Sound wise, it works. The anime has some pretty catchy insert songs, and I really enjoy the openings and endings. This is a bit of a personal problem I guess, but the shows ost on the other hand can be a bit quiet some times. however in important moments where they raise the volume, it can be really dynamic or beautiful. To give you an idea, when I went back to listen to the ost after finishing the show, I was left jaw dropped with how good some of the tracks were. But in the show they were so quiet and rarely used that I never got the chance to really enjoy them.Overall, I think it's a great series that anyone can enjoy, kids and adults alike. to Digimon meets Yokai Watch with a sprinkle of kamen rider, and I couldn't agree more.

The protagonist isn’t a brash hothead and the monsters in the show aren’t even Digimon. They’re called Appmon, and Digimon exists only as some random game in-universe. There’s one episode featuring an Agumon as a special guest star and it’s better fanservice for Adventure fans than all of Tri but I digress. The show leans more heavily into the episodic kids show format more than any other Digimon series before it, with all the bells and whistles that entails. The episodic format is much in the vein of a...Precure (big surprise, the director also directed Doki Doki Precure), and it keeps to it even late into the show’s run. Perhaps it’s unsurprising then that the plot does take about nine eps before there’s any real forward momentum in the story. There are also often times you wish the show would go into moving the plot forward more consistently instead of diving back into episodic eps.The format as is though provides great characterization for its cast of characters, who all have their own worries that kids can relate to, however silly the context may be at times. Like there’s one kid who has to balance his role in inheriting the family’s traditional tea house while also being a mega successful Youtube personality; doing what your family wants you to do versus doing what you want to do. That characterization also helps build the foundation of several genuinely touching and emotionally resonant moments in the show. This also lets the show have a lot of opportunities to show off its brand of humor, like having a running gag playing on the common palette swap Digimon designs (“Are you guys related? Nah, we just happen to look alike.”) I’m especially a fan of one monster of the week, Musclemon in episode 28, who might as well be a Bobobo character transported in.The show doesn’t hold back from demonstrating how sinister the big villain is either. The story centers around stopping Leviathan, which was part of an AI designed to help people before but it went rogue and broke out when it determined the rules it had to obey were hindering its programmed goals. It then decides to remove the biggest obstacle to its goals: its original creator. They don’t back off from showing how vicious it is either. We see its attempts to do this in the form of hijacking self driving cars to crash into him and eventually succeeding by hacking into the medical equipment when he’s hospitalized. And while it was at it, it kept close tabs on its creators remaining family for years after he was dead. Leviathan isn’t really evil though. It’s a lot like a spin off the D-Reaper in Tamers, though growing to be far more advanced. It’s still trying to achieve that original goal set in its programming. And it so happened to determined the best way to do it is... very machine-like, to say the least.The heroes go through the typical arc of gradually collecting power ups and beating all the obstacles Leviathan sends their way. The viewer will understand this as narrative convenience, but surprisingly the show does go out of the way to justify it, the justification for it makes a lot of sense and references something that happens in real-life machine learning algorithms. The show has a lot of neat references for computer nerds, including one hidden in each of the main cast’s names. My personal favorite is the brother pair whose parents named Rei and Hajime, aka 0 and 1. I’d be curious about how a localized dub could capture the same spirit with similarly normal sounding names.With all its focus on technology and its prevalence in modern everyday life, Appli Monsters exists in the space where it could have only been made in the mid 2010s, but I’m really glad it was.

(Tri is a complete dumpster fire)If I have to use one sentence to describe this serie, it\'d be this is a show on surface level catered and aiming toward kids, however have enough insight and theme for adults to fully enjoy and appreciate the show.It\'s such a controversy approach because it may end up driving away both side of audience if they didn\'t give enough patience to sit through the whole show and digest the theme and characters. The show try to go through a deep and dark theme with flamboyant...kid-vibe presentation.  It never tries to be overly dark and edgy, yet it doesn\'t shy away from discuss about dark and serious topic.Not to mention this is the first Digimon serie to feature REAL gay relationship (It\'s not just fanfic or implied gayness like other Digimon series. It has dialogues and interaction demonstrating real affection of 2 boys).The 5 main protagonists of this series all went through amazing development and chemistry , Each of the casts have amazing backstory and character arcs to flash out their ideal, personality, goal, and affection, and none of them are really left out. You\'d end up liking all of them despite the initial controversy.The pacing of this serie is great too. The only episodes I feel unnecessary / boring/ filler-ish is ep1~4 , before the side characters showed up. The weak start of the serie probably give a bad first impression, thus drive away many audience because most people only have enough patience for as little as 3 episodes for an anime. However the pacing and story, as well as characterization really start to pick up after episode 7, thus becomes a wild ride ever since.The biggest cons of this show is probably the usage of CGI and OST choice. There are some CG model of later evolution that looks cool, but many of them looks jarring, and color usage / design is out of place compare to the 2D art. However, the action scene is done relatively well despite sometimes the 3D model looks jarring. This CG model mostly look much worse than the hand drawn Digimon in the same show.The OST choice is strange too.  Most of them are forgettable at best, and some of them even sounds annoying. There\'s only a few good OST near the end of the show.The OP and ED are both nice though. Compare to any of the previous Digimon series, this has probably the weakest OST soundtrack, especially the evolution OST.This show is criminally underrated and underwatched because it is bound by the IP ""Digimon"", and bound of the entitlement of being a ""kid show"" with its presentation , despite go through intensive and meaningful character arcs for all the main characters, as well as discussing theme better than most 13 episode seasonal anime (13 episodes is just not enough to fully flash out theme most of the time), as well as portraying a better love story than many of those 2 hrs anime movies about a boy meets a girl.This serie rivals the original Digimon adventure 01 , which none of the later in between series come close to giving me such lasting impact. kid-vibe presentation.

I\'m 28 now and I\'ve watched all Digimon media to this point and also played a few Digimon videogames.Warning to everyone planning to watch this because it\'s related to Digimon: it isn\'t. The name is there to create buzz and bring viewers because there\'s absolutely nothing Digimon in this series. The monsters are mainly based on smartphone apps and I would have no issues with this if the show didn\'t try to leech off Digimon (or any other series). Oh and what are they called? AppliMonsters. As I said, the only Digimon here...is in the tittle.We have a main character that wears goggles like 90% of Digimon stuff but that\'s all the similarities. Why is there no creativity for character design when it comes to DigiKids?Another thing is that most episodes (specially in the beginning) feel like this show exists with the sole purpose of parodying Digimon, rather than a story set in the Digiverse: a couple of monsters are basically old Digimon with new names and colours, whether humans can see and/or hear the AppliMonsters is completely random, AppliFusions visually look lazy because usually we can only see one of the monsters\' design, ... If this show didn\'t try to leech off Digimon as a series but came up on its own it would\'ve been way better because some ideas were really cool but the execution is lacking most of the time, specially when it comes to the plot.There\'s no solid pace and everything that happens seems to be random. Every several episodes the story moved forward, only to be paused for no good reason at all a few more episodes in. It\'s like the characters forget what the heck is going on and we get more stupid slice of life stuff. The series is 52 episodes but wrapping the story in 30 would be enough. Another thing about the bad pacing, is how many recaps throughout each episode. I\'m not talking about the usual recap in the beginning of each episode or the same AppliFusions every episode. I\'m talking about story/character development flashbacks that were shoved down on my laptop screen every 20 minutes. It\'s too much.Now, on to characters: I didn\'t find any particulary annoying (despite Offmon) and the Noreru Norenai Cho Noreru slogan. That thing got old after 3 seconds. I was really disappointed when Eri and Dokamon were introduced because they were fused straight away with Gatchamon, which left me to wonder what was the point of having more main characters if everyone is just going to be cannon fodder for the Goggles-Boy. Fortunally I was proven wrong because throughout the show, every single main character gets to show off in equal amounts of time and the monsters are well-balanced. This was actually the first time that I saw this happen and I\'m pleasantly surprised.Extra things that don\'t make sense:1) Hidden bookshelf\'s switch changes location depending on the episode2) the NO! joke that happens every episode is a copy of Excel Saga and Nabeshin. A 1-time reference would\'ve been good. Every episode is just ridiculous.3) SPOILERS: once the kids reach Deep Web World for the first time, Rei leaves with Hackmon to search for his missing brother. This makes no sense whatsoever because everyone is after Leviathan and everyone knows it was Leviathan that kidnapped him. Not to mention that it\'s unbelievable that no one would offer to search for the little kid as well.4) for an anime that recaps in the beginning of each episode, what\'s the logic behind having a full 24 minute episode of only recaps? Honestly, feel free to skip episode 26 because it\'s just flashbacks.5) SPOILERS: Drawmon is an enemy from the start (although the kids are unaware) but still decides to warn them of their fate if they die in the Dark Web World. Even if this monster was an ally, there\'s been so many battles up to that point that it\'s mighty clear that death means death.6) Episode 37 is so dragged out with nonsense. Only the first 3 and last 3 minutes are watchable without yawning.7) SPOILERS: episode 40 - Astra and Musimon know for a fact that Fakemon is a lying, cunning and manipulative creature. However, Astra is still easily tricked.8) Everytime a new character is introduced of gets AppRealized, their power levels show up. Dokamon has an higher power level than Gatchamon and this doesn\'t change after their power levels increased. However, Dokamon\'s punches do less damage than a soft push from Gatchamon. Also, a stronger version of Musimon still got beaten after a single weak bomb attack.9) Knight\'s horrible laughter is intentional but it\'s just cringe10) Knight\'s backstory and reasoning for being a villain is one of the most pathetic plot-devices I\'ve ever watched in an Anime11) SPOILERS: Hajime just got back his human form out of nowhere. I get, the scent of burnt eggs woke him up. And? Where\'s the transformation????12) Agumon and WarGreymon are the only ""Digimon"" that show up. Why ""Digimon""? Because in this show, they\'re regular videogame characters and not Digimon. I appreciate the original kick-ass Digivolution soundtrack but this cameo just makes the entire thing look terrible. If Digimon are no longer Digimon, then how can anyone claim that this series happen in the same Digiverse?13) The final battle between all the Godly AppliMonsters was the worst final battle I\'ve ever seen. There\'s no sense of speed or power, no momentum, everything moves so slow and there\'s nothing spectacular going on.14) SPOILERS: the whole Yuujin-Haru thing was so uninteresting and cringe15) the last 2 episodes begin with quotes about how Artificial Intelligence will drive humanity to extinction. This is a very interesting idea to explore but the way that this show explores it is just plain terrible.I think the soundtrack is flawless and the animation is pretty good for the most part. I just hated every time they used CGI.All things considered, this show gets a 4/10 from me. is in the tittle.We have a main character that wears goggles like 90% of Digimon stuff but that\'s all the similarities.

I get, the scent of burnt eggs woke him up. And? Where\'s the transformation????12) Agumon and WarGreymon are the only ""Digimon"" that show up. Why ""Digimon""? Because in this show, they\'re regular videogame characters and not Digimon. I appreciate the original kick-ass Digivolution soundtrack but this cameo just makes the entire thing look terrible. If Digimon are no longer Digimon, then how can anyone claim that this series happen in the same Digiverse?13) The final battle between all the Godly AppliMonsters was the worst final battle I\'ve ever seen. There\'s no sense of speed or power, no momentum, everything moves so slow and there\'s nothing spectacular going on.14) SPOILERS: the whole Yuujin-Haru thing was so uninteresting and cringe15) the last 2 episodes begin with quotes about how Artificial Intelligence will drive humanity to extinction. This is a very interesting idea to explore but the way that this show explores it is just plain terrible.I think the soundtrack is flawless and the animation is pretty good for the most part. I just hated every time they used CGI.All things considered, this show gets a 4/10 from me.', ""that was pretty good, not as good as Adventure 02,Tamers and Xros Wars which are my favorites but i think it's better than savers and as good as Adventure and FrontierThe story is fine, it has very interesting points and it's educative sometimes talking about the effect of I.A on our daily lives*Spoiler*I didn't like the protagonist but he got a nice ending starting to study A.I and everything*End of spoiler*Liked a lot the other characters like Eri,Astra and Rei, loved their histories.Didn't like the Songs, the first opening was nice but the second was pretty lame and the only thing that kept me...hyped for the evolutions was Haru's Grandpa funny voiceArt is good and i loved the designs they remind me of Yokai Watch i think that's why people say it's Digimon trying to copy Yokai Watch, the digimons on this one at least on their initial forms resemble humans instead of animals like in previous seasonsenjoyed watching it overall hyped for the evolutions was Haru's Grandpa funny voiceArt is good and i loved the designs they remind me of Yokai Watch i think that's why people say it's Digimon trying to copy Yokai Watch, the digimons on this one at least on their initial forms resemble humans instead of animals like in previous seasonsenjoyed watching it overall"", 'at the time I made this review, I\'ve watched up until episode 37, so maybe my opinion will change later, or maybe not, who knows?Anyway, I hated the beginning of the anime, and this is coming from someone that has watched all of the previous Digimon series, there was just SO MUCH filler, it was basically like watching Yo-Kai Watch, and then I found out that the creator of the Yo-Kai Watch anime wrote Appmon, and at that point my expectations were really low...then later it got a little better, only a little, when it actually started focusing on Leviathan, and along the way we...got to see the main characters slowly achieve their dream, and I actually like all of the characters, except for Haru, who\'s dream is to feel like the ""Main Protagonist"". Gatchmon\'s character\'s okay, he doesn\'t really have a life except for being the pokedex for this series, but he\'s okay.Eri and Dokamon are fun to watch, I just don\'t like Eri\'s catch phrase, everything else about her is great. Astra and Musimon are okay, (Musimon\'s ultimate form is easily one of my fav Digimon) and again, I hate their catch phrase, and I wish he wasn\'t such an idiot sometimes. Rei and Hackmon are really nice, definitely the only characters I can take seriously.and as for the actual Digimon, I give the designs a 9/10, I really liked the concept of a ""Digimon subspecies"", and the fact they all look really small and cartooney in their standard forms remind me of when I played all those pokemon rip-offs on my iPad, and then the super and ultimate forms look really great too, some of them became some of my favorite designs ever!overall, is Appmon good? kids will definitely like it if they\'re into action, as for the long time fans? well, I can see why some of them hate it, but I recommend at least giving it a chance. got to see the main characters slowly achieve their dream, and I actually like all of the characters, except for Haru, who\'s dream is to feel like the ""Main Protagonist"".

E's Otherwise,https://myanimelist.net/anime/236/Es_Otherwise,"[""MainE's Otherwise is most definitely one of the many thousands of animes that's just out there to be.....out there. I've started calling these types of shows &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; animes. Animes churned out by these big production companies out more for capital gain with no regard for product integrity. E's Otherwise is a series that really makes no sense and you'll almost, right from the get-go, need to modify your outlook [....and lower your expectations] on this show or you'll switch it off. If you are going to watch this show, you can't take it too seriously....even when the show itself is asking...you to take it seriously, you can't and shouldn't cuz you'd be better off not doing so.Art-StyleThe art style was the standard type of art seen in most animes. A lot of bright colors were used, which is always nice. I like animes with bright, cheery colors! So you'll see a lot of fantastic colors as well as all the special lighting/glowing effects that they use to illustrate each of the characters' special powers. Their movements were also pretty good, tho nothing really too outstanding except for maybe during the fight scenes especially when it came to the hand-to-hand combat scenes.SoundBoth OP and ED songs are pretty good for being little more than prefab POP confections, as they say, tho I'd have to say I do like the OP theme song a bit more. It has a very nice techno-dance beat that you might not realize unless you have a good surround sound system or you're listening to the song thru some decent headphones, like I did. I watched the show in English which might not have been a good idea since a lot of animes loose a lot of their original meanings and integrity with the translations, maybe that's what happened to this show. But for what it's worth I think the English actors did a decent job and I've always been a fan of Hilary Haag, she can do no wrong in my eyes.StoryThe story.....hmmmmm! Honestly, the story is a bit of a mess, I mean some parts of it WAS OK but huge parts of it was not OK....and I don't mean 'kinda' bad but 'LOTSA' bad!!! It was just so corny with all this unfounded and seemingly unnecessary angst. It really detracted from the show...so much so that I thought filler eps. were way much more fun and entertaining than the main plot of the show. Because if you paid too much attention to the main storyline, you'd get a headache and definitely hate the show...there were just too many problems with it. Mainly in the fact that it seemed so totally disingenuous, for example, this one [semi-main] character dies pretty early on in the series and no one seemed to care too much about it, they just all forgot about her pretty darn quick if you ask me....and then, we've got Kai who just ups and decides to live with Yuki and Asuka all but forgetting about his sickly, invalid sister who's laid up in the hospital for a good chunk of the series.So like I said, there'll come these instances that the show demands all these intense emotions from you [the viewer] and it totally fails, miserably I might add, because it was too bloody flip and was emotionally glib from the outset. Not to mention, without spoilers, the ending is pretty much a train wreck so I whole-heartedly recommend enjoying the show more for it's filler content and not take this anime too seriously and there are plenty of funny moments/episodes that were just laugh-out-loud funny. If you do want to watch a more meaningful show with the similar [albeit thinly veiled] message of &ldquo;freaks are people too&rdquo; then you are better off watching the X-Men movies.Cast/CharactersThe way the characters looked was what caught my attention about this show in the first place....I thought Kai looked very much like Kira Yamato from Gundam Seed so following that train of thought, I assumed this show might have been created by the same people. Tho upon closer inspection, it's pretty evident they weren't... but even if they aren't created by the same people they both have a lot of things in common, namely, they both have that certain passive/aggressive tendency or that um, whatchamacallit, Berserker Complex.Anywho besides Kai, I think a lot of the characters have a certain physical appeal about them even if that's all they have going for them [meaning, a lot of the characters lack depth, they just look cute!] My favorite character for sure is Sheri, she's just too sarcastically funny the way she just whips out these one-liners is comic genius, now whether or not the creators intended for her to be that witty is another story.On the other hand, the character I found most annoying was that kid, Raphael, because to me he tried too hard to be cute and he played the sympathy card way too soon after we are introduced to him....[tho I suspect this in large part due to the poor adaptation from the manga] but by and large, just looking at this character hearing his sob story, and you see what I mean by the show being emotionally 'demanding' or trying to emotionally manipulate the viewer for no apparent reason but to just elicit sympathy. I also think that, the one gigantic eye of Raphael's is just too huge, singular and creepy, it takes up about 50% the length of his face! They did a horrible job with the character design on that kid that's for sure!Worth it or NOT?OK so, it's my opinion that this show isn't all that great and succeeds much more as a comedy than it does as a drama mainly because all the dramatic elements in this show are extremely bad and a whole lot cheesier than a bag of Cheetos due to the apparently sub-par adaptation from the original manga version. So it's either hit or miss. That's not to say it's a bad show all in all, there were a lot of funny moments and likable characters.

Glass no Usagi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3646/Glass_no_Usagi,"['When you make an anti-war movie, you must incorporate a few things. First of all, your message should always be ""war is super bad, never think otherwise"". Second, you have to have at least one enemy attack, a bombing, if possible. Third, you need to show people suffering (this is really just for getting the message of ""war is super bad, never think otherwise"" across). And fourth, there has to be hope for the future and the best scene to show that is homecoming. All you need now is to construct a story around all this and you\'re set.Constructing a story is what ""The Glass...Rabbit"" has tried as well. Sadly, it did not really succeed.The movie is about Toshiko, the daughter of a skillful guy who runs a glass factory. He is doing quite well, the family is obviously happy, but war is already present in their lives. And when it finally breaks out, Toshiko is thrown into a series of trials she has to overcome - or, well, a series of deaths and betrayals.The sad thing is, the first half of the movie is actually quite decent. It\'s not so much about Toshiko but rather about the whole family trying to cope with the harsh reality of war and persevering somehow. The have to cut expenses, they have to move around, they have to separate a few times, they have to continue their life just like before - all that has made me somehow interested in what would happen next and there are only a few things to complain about, but then the movie starts to get worse.It does so right at the point where the focus shifts from the family in general to Toshiko in particular and her long path of ""suffering"". With each death you notice more how it\'s all about shock value, as if there wasn\'t enough suffering before. There are some points in the movie where it basically says ""Look, it\'s war, we need to be as cruel as we can get"". Near the end the movie seems to forget all that made it watchable (much like it forgot the titular glass rabbit) and when the war finally comes to an end it\'s not only a sign of relief for the characters but for the viewers as well.There isn\'t much to say otherwise. This is neither a new nor a big productoin, so you won\'t notice both the animation (which there isn\'t much of) and the sound. The characters are pretty one-dimensional for the most part, as you may have already guessed. Many of them are background characters anyway, serving either the purpose of dying or bullying Toshiko. Really, the only thing of actual worth in this movie is its historical value. Which there isn\'t much of, unfortunately. Oh, and the movie gets the message of ""war is super bad, never think otherwise"" across.To sum things up, this is not a good movie. Your time is better spent with things like ""Grave of the Fireflies"" which may be not a good movie as well, but at least it\'s of actual value, since the movie and the novel it was based on were born of survivor\'s guilt. Or you can even watch ""Chocchan\'s Story"" instead which is not good as well, but at least it shows people who were relatively well-off during the war and didn\'t suffer horrible tragedies. This fact alone is pretty refreshing. Rabbit"" has tried as well. Sadly, it did not really succeed.The movie is about Toshiko, the daughter of a skillful guy who runs a glass factory. He is doing quite well, the family is obviously happy, but war is already present in their lives. And when it finally breaks out, Toshiko is thrown into a series of trials she has to overcome - or, well, a series of deaths and betrayals.The sad thing is, the first half of the movie is actually quite decent. It\'s not so much about Toshiko but rather about the whole family trying to cope with the harsh reality of war and persevering somehow. The have to cut expenses, they have to move around, they have to separate a few times, they have to continue their life just like before - all that has made me somehow interested in what would happen next and there are only a few things to complain about, but then the movie starts to get worse.It does so right at the point where the focus shifts from the family in general to Toshiko in particular and her long path of ""suffering"". With each death you notice more how it\'s all about shock value, as if there wasn\'t enough suffering before. There are some points in the movie where it basically says ""Look, it\'s war, we need to be as cruel as we can get"". Near the end the movie seems to forget all that made it watchable (much like it forgot the titular glass rabbit) and when the war finally comes to an end it\'s not only a sign of relief for the characters but for the viewers as well.There isn\'t much to say otherwise. This is neither a new nor a big productoin, so you won\'t notice both the animation (which there isn\'t much of) and the sound. The characters are pretty one-dimensional for the most part, as you may have already guessed. Many of them are background characters anyway, serving either the purpose of dying or bullying Toshiko. Really, the only thing of actual worth in this movie is its historical value. Which there isn\'t much of, unfortunately. Oh, and the movie gets the message of ""war is super bad, never think otherwise"" across.To sum things up, this is not a good movie. Your time is better spent with things like ""Grave of the Fireflies"" which may be not a good movie as well, but at least it\'s of actual value, since the movie and the novel it was based on were born of survivor\'s guilt. Or you can even watch ""Chocchan\'s Story"" instead which is not good as well, but at least it shows people who were relatively well-off during the war and didn\'t suffer horrible tragedies. This fact alone is pretty refreshing.', ""I'm not into war movies. I don't hate the genre. I just never really found any war movies that really interested me or caught my eyes. A lot of the war movies that are made in America are much too melodramatic, action packed, and political for my tastes, and they focus too much on the struggles of the adults, especially adults in high positions like in the government or the White House, than on the struggles of middle class families and especially the children, and I've seen a few war movies that focus on the struggles of the children that are done surprisingly well, even...if they have different takes on their subject matter, like Grave of the Fireflies (I really need to finish that) and Who's Left Behind. However, this doesn't automatically mean that there aren't war movies about children that are generic or bad. I saw Glass Rabbit before I saw Who's Left Behind, mostly because I FINALLY found a place where I can watch it, even though the bad sound quality kinda irked me, though I endured it anyway. Where else would I be able to find it? However, while I did like Glass Rabbit to an extent and acknowledge the good things it does have, overall, it IS rather generic despite being based on a real person's story (just like Who's Left Behind).Basically, the story's about Toshiko Ei who lives in Tokyo with her mother, father, older brothers, and two little sisters. Her father works in a glass factory and makes her a rabbit made out of glass (which is pretty much a MacGuffin used to symbolize the happy memories they had before the war went out of control). Soon, her brothers are drafted to work as soldiers in the war and once the destruction comes sneaking up on them, they have to evacuate in case they get hit by firebombs. Not everyone in her family is happy about the sudden changes in their lives, however. But in the end, it doesn't even matter, as Toshiko loses the majority of her family members one by one, and wonders how she'll be able to survive in a war torn country with little to no infrastructure.Sound familiar? Yeah, one reviewer I know who also saw this movie accused it of being a blatant rip-off of Who's Left Behind (and really, you can see the similarities). While I wouldn't accuse it of being this, as there are probably a lot of people who suffered the same tragedies as Toshiko did, the presentation of this movie is rather mediocre. It really doesn't have much personality or charm or themes other than the usual war is bad scenario. The animation isn't much to write home about, and some of the characters looked a bit off model at points. While I did like the music, it was rather dull. However, I definitely appreciated some details in this anime. For one thing, I learned in my Modern Japan class that after World War II, Japan made a new constitution preventing them from ever entering any wars, along with never having an Army, Navy, or any other military-related government. This movie reminds us of exactly that, and they at least get those details right, which definitely gives me the right to give the movie some credit. I also liked the little twist where a little baby saw the airplanes about to fire at them before they actually attacked. That was pretty cool.Admittedly though, some of the things that happened in this movie really baffled me, especially since this is based on a real person's life. For one thing, Toshiko's little sisters, unhappy with living with their relatives, suddenly decide to GO BACK TO THEIR HOUSE ALL ON THEIR OWN and choose to stay there, even though it's practically a death sentence. Questions: how did they manage to get back? Did they take a train? And if they did, how did they get the money for it in a country where it's impossible to receive any kind of monetary income amongst internal turmoil? Are they even old enough to even know how to travel a long distance by foot and with the proper means? What? Yeah, I'm completely flummoxed. That was a pretty stupid decision on their part, and I have to wonder if kids in Japan are trained to be really self-sufficient, way before they even get put in situations where they should be self-sufficient. Also, did people really build makeshift houses like that back then? I don't remember my Modern Japan class talking about how people pitched in and built houses like that (though I know people made makeshift houses, cars, and even restaurants during an earthquake that hit Mexico in 1985 when the police and government decided to hide under a rock instead of help the citizens). Speaking of characters, admittedly they're rather one dimensional. We're constantly being reminded that Toshiko is strong, but we don't see her grow or develop, even though she does show some weakness, which I can appreciate. I did like the slice of life moments, especially the scenes where she befriends a goat and receives a lot of support from her friends after tragedy strikes. I liked those little moments, as things like that really do happen in real life. But no, I didn't cry at this. This movie's a bit too cheesy for me.If you're not into sad movies, war movies, or generic melodrama, give it a miss. If you want something to kill some time with, this'll give you some solid entertainment. if they have different takes on their subject matter, like Grave of the Fireflies (I really need to finish that) and Who's Left Behind.

I thought after 4 months that they do make an OVA for this, it was going to be an additional episode possibly leading to a season 2 or establish the cliffhanger in the last episode of the original anime.

Green Legend Ran,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1169/Green_Legend_Ran,"[""Green Legend Ran is the kind of anime you'd to see on the sci fi channel at four in the morning one night out of the blue and absolutely love. It's really a diamond in the rough, folks. The story might seem unoriginal but it was a fairly unexplored concept when it was made. The idea is a little similar to Trigun and Origin: Spirits of the past, which I think some's reccomended. It's darker in tone, though, and the conclusion is a little abrupt. The art isn't outstanding but it serves it's purpose. Some characters are more thought out design-wise than others, which is...a bit of a shame. The sound serves its purpose but you'll just as soon forget it. The story outshines the characters sometimes but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It's still worth watching, I've enjoyed it a lot over the years. a bit of a shame. The sound serves its purpose but you'll just as soon forget it. The story outshines the characters sometimes but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It's still worth watching, I've enjoyed it a lot over the years."", 'Green Legend Ran is an interesting little OVA from the early 90s that\'s probably too ambitious for its own good. It\'s got ancient aliens, a post-apocalyptic earth, opposing factions consisting of religious extremists and their corresponding resistance, a revenge plot, a love story, and some kind of environmental message. Taking place in such a detailed setting with such a detailed lore, it doesn\'t quite know where to start and where to end.And that\'s a major problem for Green Legend Ran: It has lots of interesting ideas, but it doesn\'t spend the appropriate amount of time on each one, and in that way its two...hour run time paradoxically feels both too long and too short. The narrative that\'s woven between all of these concepts can be a little jarring as a result, causing the motivations of some characters to come into question. Some holes are present in the plot, too. While it\'s not really hard to catch on eventually, it is hard to feel engaged when you\'re not always invested in what\'s going on. And, although the concepts can be interesting, they\'re sometimes relegated to expository dialogue instead of being explored through actions.The main characters of this OVA are Ran and Aira, and they have some pretty good chemistry together. In fact, the best scene of the series is simply a lighthearted one that features the two of them playfully getting to know each other while on an errand to fetch some resources. The animators portray their body language so fluidly and realistically here that it\'s just really fun to watch. But, as fun as it is, the scene\'s simply not long enough to convince the viewer that Ran already feels as strongly as he does for Aira. As soon as she gets snatched up by the bad guys, he\'s already dead set on risking his life for her, and they\'ve only talked for what was maybe twenty minutes at best. Not only is this abrupt parting unsuccessful in providing a compelling character motivation for Ran, it also robs the rest of the series of further interactions between these two characters, which is especially disappointing.Ran himself isn\'t exactly the most likable character, either—at least sometimes. It\'s an odd situation where the show clearly tries its hardest to make you care for him...and you know, it does work to an extent, but there\'s just something about it that doesn\'t feel genuine—like they were going through a checklist of things they could mix together to make a protagonist that would earn your sympathy, when ultimately he just comes across as a nasally-voiced little shit half the time. The emotional climaxes of his arc seem kind of awkward, too, probably due to him hardly getting the chances to interact with those characters who are supposed to be so important to him. However, Ran does have some cute moments with Jeke that do manage to feel genuine despite their predictability.What probably ends up being the most fascinating aspect of this series is its atypical interpretation of environmentalism. It\'s almost the antithesis to the idealistic pro-earth beliefs of someone like Hayao Miyazaki; here, rather than being put on a pedestal, the forces of nature are represented by an oppressive alien god who actually feels like an exaggerated mockery of the type of person who would love nothing more than to see the earth purged of us ""rotten humans"" who do nothing but destroy it. This series proposes that wishing for such a thing would probably be going too far and that moderation is important for both sides. To be fair, though, Miyazaki\'s works never quite go that far either, as they usually end on the hopeful note of giving humans a second chance. However, nature is usually portrayed as the side that\'s deserving of the most respect in his stories, and it\'ll certainly never be painted as the villain. (And, if you\'ve read certain quotes from the man, you\'ll know he\'s the type who\'d probably be more in agreement with the ""screw humanity"" creed of the alien god of this story.) Regardless, it is refreshing to see an anime that tackles this subject matter from an angle that\'s different from what\'s seen most of the time.Now, if there\'s one thing that\'s clear about this OVA it\'s that it looks very good. It\'s got appealing character designs, the animation is stellar, and there\'s a lot of momentum that\'s given to every action; objects and characters have a nice physicality and weight to them. The setting of the series also really comes through in the creative shot compositions that show off the gorgeous landscapes of the desert and the rows of rusty industrial buildings. There\'s also a great use of lighting here, where vivid, colorful rays and other shapes frequently shine though and pop against the darker backdrops creating an atmosphere with a lot of depth. The only negative when it comes to the look of the show is the occasional use of black gradients that are thrown on top of shots which looks pretty lazy and distracting. But, other than that, the visuals provide nothing but eye candy throughout the entire series.The more I think about it, the more the story of Green Legend Ran actually feels like something better suited for a long JRPG, where all of its ideas could\'ve had the time to shine. Some scenes even feature segments that could\'ve easily been gameplay instead, particularly one moment where Ran has to follow directions written on notes left by another character in order to make it through a mysterious maze. That being said, the glimpse we do get of this world, however disjointed, is one that\'s filled with imagination.

It was brought to us by AIC, the same studio that was responsible for Battle Athletes, Blue Gender, SoltyRei, Explorer Woman Ray & a variety of others. I don't know anything going into it besides it being science fiction. So, let's take a look and see if this one, unlike the last OVA I dug up, is worth a look.Story:In the distant future our planet has been transformed into a world of desserts after giant extra terrestrials dropped onto our planet. There are contained patches of green, but they're few and hidden away. In...this world, the ruling class is made up of the Rodoists, people who worship the invading aliens and control the water supply. An opposition faction called Hazzard has also stepped up to fight against the Rodoists while most people are caught in the middle. We follow Ran, a young man who wants to join Hazzard to take revenge for his mother's death. She was killed by a man with a scar on his chest during a confrontation betwixt the Rodoists & Hazzard. He meets up with  Hazzard and befriends a girl his age named Aira. She's immediately abnormal because of her silver hair. Normally that wouldn't be strange in an anime, but in this one it's significant. What does her silver hair mean? Will Ran manage to find his mother's killer? What will happen between the factions?While there are some interesting ideas on display, the execution leaves much to be desired. The series is pretty passable at building things up but its resolutions tend to last for all of thirty seconds and be unsatisfying. Ran spends most of the OVA repeating himself and contributing very little to the events that are happening. The story arc manages to simultaneously drag and skip over important elements. We'll get long, slow periods that will contribute little or repeat information we already have and then we'll skip ahead in time and be left with the impression that something important happened between the scenes but they aren't sharing what. The environmental message in this is also really unsubtle and in your face. On a scale of Captain Planet bad to a Miyazaki film, it comes considerably closer to Captain Planet.To the OVA's credit, it does have some pretty strong moments when it manages to keep its focus. I also do kind of like the ending to the series. It does subvert the kind of ending you'd expect.Characters:There are some major problems with the characterisation in this OVA. First off, there are the villains. When a villain is supposed to be somewhat sympathetic, the series tries to hammer that in with really stilted dialogue. Which may or may not work. When a villain is just a villain, they're cartoonishly, over the top evil. Then we have Ran himself. He's a really dull character. It doesn't help that he's largely completely inept and just yammers on about the same things constantly. There's also the dynamic betwixt Aira and Ran. It comes across as completely contrived in order to move the plot. They spend maybe a day in one another's company and all of a sudden they're the best of friends and willing to completely rely on one another. I would only buy that if one of them was actually a dog. Not a dog in human form, but a literal dog of some kind.Art:The artwork and animation vary. On one hand, the OVA is quite good when it comes to strange, surreal imagery. There are quite a few scenes that employ that aesthetic effectively. In contrast, their stuff with ordinary people can be pretty bad. There are a lot of awkward movements that no normal human would do without actively trying to contort themselves, a lot of awkward facial expressions that don't actually match the emotion that the character is supposed to be conveying and a lot of action sequences weakened by a combination thereof. There's also the design of their desert suits to be considered. They look like they're made of heavy material and they have completely unnecessary shoulder pads. Because when you're under a hot sun, you want heavy material with extra features that weigh you down. There's also the question of how they're supposed to function. They look a bit like diving suits. Initially, I thought they might be like proto-stillsuits where they recycle a character's lost moisture but there's never any indication that they can get moisture from them. It's almost like they didn't even consider functionality and just designed something stupid. At least it wasn't a battle bikini.Sound:The performances in this aren't bad but they aren't good either. Ultimately what we get from Kikuchi Hidehiro, Yayoi Mitsuki and the others are passable performances. The music from Yoshikawa Youichirou is decent enough. It's not as good as the soundtrack he did for Iria, certainly, but it's all right.Ho-yay:Don't expect to find any here.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, Green Legend Ran is a series with a promising premise, that's held back by poor execution. The story ends up with more weak moments than strong moments. The characters are largely bland, or worse. The artwork is bad when it comes to conveying normalcy and the acting is just mediocre. It's not a bad little OVA, but in the end, my final rating is going to be a 4/10. It's weak. Next week I'll look at another OVA with AD Police. this world, the ruling class is made up of the Rodoists, people who worship the invading aliens and control the water supply.

It's almost like they didn't even consider functionality and just designed something stupid. At least it wasn't a battle bikini.Sound:The performances in this aren't bad but they aren't good either. Ultimately what we get from Kikuchi Hidehiro, Yayoi Mitsuki and the others are passable performances. The music from Yoshikawa Youichirou is decent enough. It's not as good as the soundtrack he did for Iria, certainly, but it's all right.Ho-yay:Don't expect to find any here.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, Green Legend Ran is a series with a promising premise, that's held back by poor execution. The story ends up with more weak moments than strong moments. The characters are largely bland, or worse. The artwork is bad when it comes to conveying normalcy and the acting is just mediocre. It's not a bad little OVA, but in the end, my final rating is going to be a 4/10. It's weak. Next week I'll look at another OVA with AD Police."", 'Once again , this was one anime in a bargain VHS box decades ago i passed on because it din´t look interesting.Decades and some months later i´ve watched it and it was an adventure i wish i was in it, at first look it is more to figure out ( after the narration ofc) where this ova is going , because though i had no expectations at all,  after the 1st episode i was a bit skeptical about the animation and all, but DON´T Judge a book by its cover.Onwards to part 2 &3 the storyline and all became more clear, even though...some early 90´s anime had some bad 1980´s animation habits, it looked more ´proffesionally directed´ more colour and better camera work.Storywise it reminded me a bit of the 1995 anime Blue Seed wich has simmilair plantlike enemies, Green legend ran looks more respectively but a much cheaper idea and product, but still fun.Soundwise i had no problems with, i LOVE those 90´s anime sound effects blended into it.No way that the charachters were´stereotypical´ because each importantcharachter has like a clear own personality, ok at times it drops at unexpected moments but thats how it was back then, as for the heroes and villians design it looks quite good, but the villians got a special design given to then ( mainly the ´super villians´) since they are not from earth,that is understandable ofc. Through some oldskool grainy scene´s and sometimes wobbly sidecharachters i had a good time given to me , and as a lone ova project from the 90´s it had a good potential to became more ´wellknown´ as would put it so overall its a good saturdaynight  anime for 135 min! enjoy some early 90´s anime had some bad 1980´s animation habits, it looked more ´proffesionally directed´ more colour and better camera work.Storywise it reminded me a bit of the 1995 anime Blue Seed wich has simmilair plantlike enemies, Green legend ran looks more respectively but a much cheaper idea and product, but still fun.Soundwise i had no problems with, i LOVE those 90´s anime sound effects blended into it.No way that the charachters were´stereotypical´ because each importantcharachter has like a clear own personality, ok at times it drops at unexpected moments but thats how it was back then, as for the heroes and villians design it looks quite good, but the villians got a special design given to then ( mainly the ´super villians´) since they are not from earth,that is understandable ofc.

The $1 was well worth the investment—Green Legend Ran changed my life, in my teens, and I still think about it quite often in my ‘20s!—Story/CharactersGreen Legend Ran takes place on a post-apocalyptic Earth that has become a barren wasteland after an alien invasion. Six of the “Rodo”—a race of giant monoliths that are revealed to be more than what they seem later...in the OVA—crash through the atmosphere and, through emitting a force field of carbon dioxide in the areas where they land, causing all of the planet’s food and water to erode. The massive climate change causes the divide between the wealthy and poor to become more extreme, leading the wealthier class to monopolize the remaining reservoirs.The two factions are:a)\tThe ‘Rodoists’—the wealthy have taken to hoarding the remaining sources of food and water from the poor. They also fanatically worship the Rodo, despite their lack of communication with the monoliths. They refer to the areas around the monoliths as the ‘Holy Green.’b)\tThe ‘Hazard’—a revolutionary movement that opposes the Rodoists.Travel between communities is infrequent, at a certain distance away from the monoliths, because of the carbon dioxide, the air between the impoverished and the ‘Holy Green’ can’t be breathed—necessitating *pressurized vehicles and suits. The only people that are legally authorized to use the pressurized vehicles and suits are merchants that bring the small villages food and water from the ‘Holy Green’ but it is barely enough to survive on and many of the villagers die from either starvation or dehydration.*The suits and vehicles are very similar to equipment used for space travel.Ran is a young, orphaned boy who seeks to survive, join the Hazard, and enact revenge on the man who murdered his mother, a muscular man with a scar on his chest. During a failed Hazard attack, he meets *Aira. During their meeting, Aira slaps him for trying to kill a wounded Rodoist and she says that he’s no different from them if he’s a murderer. After spending some time around Aira’s tranquil aura, Ran’s anger begins to wane.Suddenly, the Rodoist army attacks the Hazard base and Aira is abducted. Ran tries to board the Rodo *sand ship as it is taking off, doubly enraged at the sight of the man who killed his mother, but fails. Ran attempts to traverse the desert in a stolen pressure suit to rescue Aira from the Rodoist’s base and is rescued by traveling merchants, right before the oxygen tank in his suit runs out.*Think Frank Herbert’s Dune.The merchant leader, a contemplative man named Jeke, offers Ran his assistance to rescue Aira. They infiltrate the ‘Holy Green’ disguised as supply shipment, and it is revealed that Aira is not only abducted by the Rodoists to *extract water from her veins but to also as *a source of communication with the Rodo. Meanwhile, Ran catches up with Aira—after the man who killed his mother, Kiba, comes face-to-face with Jeke, who is then revealed to be Ran’s father!*Aira is a descendant of Rodo, born from the monolith, so she’s a plant-human hybrid. Rodoists are able to distinguish descendants of Rodo apart from normal humans because of their silver hair. In captivity, she meets Rurui, another descendent of Rodo, who talks to her telepathically before he dies from having all of the water extracted from his body. It’s not explicitly stated but it implies that they keep her alive, as a source of communication, because she’s a sexually attractive female and the previous descendent was male.Rodo manifests itself into a human form and tells Aira that the Rodo can replenish Earth’s greenery, but are waiting for the remaining humans to kill each other, so all other lifeforms of Earth won’t be destroyed by human greed. Rodo urges Aira to join the past maidens in a collective conscious to let humans be their own undoing. Aira pleads with Rodo to give humanity another chance; Rodo concedes and decides to leave the planet with the other monoliths.Jeke leaves behind an escape plan for Aira and Ran to be ejected from Rodo’s alien pods that are filled with seeds. Jeke then blows up the Rodoist’s base, killing most of them, himself, and Kiba; and the Rodo lifts up into space and it begins to *heavily rain; and the Earth begins to go back to how it used to be, before the apocalypse. The end.*In the first OVA, it only shown to sparsely rain. To the point where the people in the Hazard faction can barely even glean sustenance from how little it does.Before Green Legend Ran, many of the OVAs I had seen weren’t able to form a cohesive story; that’s why my mind was blown upon my first viewing! The conclusion with hopeful melody of ‘Tears and Rain’ by Ichirō Suzuki playing, while Aira and Ran glance lovingly at each other is one of the greatest endings!The characters weren’t the strongest but the duality between Ran and Aira’s demeanors, as well as the roles that they played—more than made up for it! I still believe that Green Legend Ran is a criminally underrated gem, and after revisiting it, I still believe that! If only, more people would just sporadically find something at a used bookstore and decide to check it out on a whim. I still am fairly sporadic with streaming, but there was a certain magic to staring at a physical VHS cover and eagerly anticipating whether it would be good or not!—TechnicalThere are a couple of A-list seiyū in this production, which is surprise seeing as it was a *Mushi Production animation.

Ōhashi also did key animation for a lot of animations that I am a fan of, like Bakuen Campus Guardress, Darkside Blues, Fushigi no Umi no Nadia, Tokyo Babylon, and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust!Conclusively, Green Legend Ran is story that still tugs at my heartstrings—after more than a decade of initially watching it. My eyes still tear up when I hear the opening verse of ‘Yasashisa wa Furu Ame no Yōni’ or when I think about Aira and Ran’s scene together at the reservoir or when Aira pleads with the Rodo to forgive humanity for its mistakes; Green Legend Ran is a powerful OVA that is still near and dear to my heart!

Honoo no Tenkousei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2050/Honoo_no_Tenkousei,"[""To begin with, I'd like to say that this show is only a 10/10 if you know anything about Fist of the North Star and the shows of Go Nagai.If you have, or know anything about fighting anime in general, you'll love this. Because it's a total love letter to them all. There is basically no plot, just two episodes of lots of punching, shouting, sideburns and jokes.The art-style is a Go Nagai-esque heavy lined style, very much like an animated manga. The music is full of heroic themes, and a rock OP reminiscent of Ai Wo Torimodose (as is fitting.)What the show...does well is compress into two episodes every fighting show cliche it can, from ludicrously named finishers to the devoted girlfriend and the school violence which provides the backdrop for things like the Getter Robo manga. There are unsubtle VA jokes, and no pretence of a fourth wall.It's because of this that Honoo no Tenkousei is so fun. It's nice to have a show that's only two episodes of breakneck-paced action every once in a while, and the jokes really hit the spot.There's not really much more to say - HnT is a love letter to the fighting anime genre which pokes fun at it while employing all the cliches in a competent way, and really can't be recommended enough if you like that sort of thing. does well is compress into two episodes every fighting show cliche it can, from ludicrously named finishers to the devoted girlfriend and the school violence which provides the backdrop for things like the Getter Robo manga.

This shonen/delinquent parody stars Takizawa Noboru, a good-natured but daft boy who challenges the school bully Ibuki Saburo for the love of Yukari Takamura. Honjakuniku High seems to only follow one rule, and it\'s the one unwritten rule of all fighting anime: the winner of a fight gets whatever they want. The endearing thing about Blazing Transfer Student\'s style of humor is that it never leaves the mind of its setting. The characters are all teenagers and consistently act as melodramatic...and self-absorbed as one would expect selfish high schoolers given free reign to do, and masculinity is portrayed as a stupid form of expression prioritized by stupid people rather than something to aspire to, no matter who wins. The bully brags about his ridiculously trite finishing move, ""Insect Killing Punch"", and everyone fears it because of the intimidating way he presents his personality rather than the pointless thing the punch did in the first place. You remember high school, don\'t you? People are popular for speaking loudly, not for the content of their speech.Of course, beyond parodying high school there\'s general mockery of dramatic action cliches. My personal favorite comes in the climax when the main character realizes his own special attack is never landing first because naturally he has to finish saying the attack name before it hits, but its name is longer than the bully\'s attack name. Simply changing the name would be an unacceptable finish for a hero, of course. Gainax takes an interesting direction for art style here, intentionally copying the rough and thick outlines of 70s anime and the simple ""blobby"" facial expressions of comedy anime from around the same time. Due to the budget only having to be spread out two episodes and Gainax\'s resources in 1991 being far better than the 70s anime they\'re paying homage to, the frame rate turns out to be very smooth and the blu-rays specifically really make the simple solid colors pop for a very visually appealing look with a lot of charm that holds up in high resolutions. More than the jokes themselves, this is the selling point of this OVA. The soundtrack is lightly enjoyable with the main opening being suitably retro while the mix of synthesizers/rock in the score is more contemporary, along with the cute ending theme that\'ll make any 90s anime fan nostalgic. Though the OVA is too short to really go anywhere and seems like it could\'ve built upon the charm of its humor and environment, it also doesn\'t allow itself to overextend or wear out its personality or sense of humor. The great production values, animation, and short running time make this an easy and enjoyable watch that\'s both simple and difficult to particularly recommend. Anyone who\'s discovered this OVA exists is the kind of genre fan very unlikely to think they\'ve wasted their time with it. and self-absorbed as one would expect selfish high schoolers given free reign to do, and masculinity is portrayed as a stupid form of expression prioritized by stupid people rather than something to aspire to, no matter who wins.

It’s an old Gainax OVA from 1991 in which a mysterious transfer student arrives at his new school and immediately gets into battles with the leaders at the school. The school runs entirely on student power and whoever beats someone else in a fight can claim whatever the loser owned. The influence is fairly clear, albeit made stranger by the fact the original Blazing Transfer Student manga was itself intended as a parody of old 70s fighting...manga like Tomorrow’s Joe. We’ve human centipeded our way through anime history where nothing is original anymore and parodies are turned straight.The story is all very flimsy in Blazing Transfer Student. This punk ass dude has ‘won’ a girl from another guy and now she’s forced to be his girlfriend. But then in comes our transfer student bent on rescuing the girl because if he does she will totally put out and this is oh so romantic. The two of them get into a hastily constructed boxing ring on the school grounds and fight for her heart, with the fights being decided largely by who can say the name of their death-punch faster. Well that, and a pair of vultures who land on the person they deem to be worthy of laying a nest on. Since it’s a mock-up of 70s manga it follows the same aesthetic with big thick lines and poofy hairdos. I’d heard a bit of fuss made over the animation since it was the Project A-Ko team together. It’s generally pretty well animated and dynamically presented by early 90s OVA standards, but it did remind me how glad I am we have moved past the period where much of the episode is repeated animation.It’s largely all gags, which is why it’s a little disappointing that many of the gags miss rather than hit. Pulling perv faces, yelling loudly or hitting someone make up many of the gags. Thankfully there’s enough good ones to make it worthwhile. The original back and forth of rhetorical warfare when the transfer student enters the school originally is brilliant, and the whole layer of self-parody makes it funny. On some level I would have preferred it be much wilder, but that may have been me spoiled by Kill la Kill and its giant flying speakers shooting recorder missiles, and it wouldn’t necessarily fit with the tone it was going for.  It treads close enough to the real thing that it’s extra funny when battles are decided by someone saying the name of their death punch faster. It’s fun, but a total trifle that you’ll forget the exact details of a week later. manga like Tomorrow’s Joe.

The characters are portrayed better then expected each bringing over there comedy to the ova so well that if you aren't laughing I'm shocked.The fighting in this serious is well brought over as the manga doesn't really follow any tradional martial arts but instead an all out crazy system especially in the beginning with an winners takes all system.Overall amazing well done worth watching only a couple of episodes long and still this ova will produce a bunch of laughs and fighting enjoyment.Downsides are that the manga is a much longer and In dept story...including a number of characters that sadly won't be seen here and a lot more insane fighting scenes. Overall just quite generally sad that no full anime was made for this series so deserved it. including a number of characters that sadly won't be seen here and a lot more insane fighting scenes.

One of the main reasons I watched it is because I am going through all of Gainax's older works. I really liked the art style, which had thick black lines and a dirty cel look. The animation was choppy but that was on purpose since they were trying to emulate the look of older fighting anime. The story is not very great, but it's not supposed to be since it is only two episodes. The ending was decent but was very predictable.Overall, this is a decent anime to watch, especially if you want to watch some of...Gainax's older anime, and see where the studio started.

After that, I believe he won the Noble Prize for Literature in \'91. Nadine Gordimer? She doesn\'t exist. I wish more anime were like this OVA. Don\'t let that score fool you, this anime is incredible. In fact, don\'t even look at it. You\'re going to look at it right after you read this review, aren\'t you? Well, there\'s a new transfer student and his name is Noboru Takizawa. At this school, students settle arguments and...disputes not with their words, but with their fists. Boxing is a prominent sport at this school. Some students would use dirty tricks to win a match. Enter Saburo Ibuki. Saburo is a cheater who would do pretty much anything to win. Especially if love is on the line. He\'s madly in love with a young girl named, Yukari Takamura. A girl who is CLEARLY not into Saburo, but he\'s too dumb and oblivious to take a hint. Noboru can see that she\'s in distress and the only way to save her is to defeat Saburo. If he loses, Yukari will be stuck in a relationship with Saburo.I\'ve never watched an anime that engaged me and made emotional so quickly before. It\'s only fifty minutes long. That\'s impressive. This OVA through me back to when I first fell in love with Ashita no Joe. Tenkousei captures almost all the excitement I felt back then with a comedic twist to it. It felt nostalgic. I love the scruffiness and dark outlines of the character designs. Kazuhiko Shimamoto has the best character designs in all of anime. It pulls of the 70\'s anime aesthetic very well. There are some shots that do look Go Nagai-ish, not sure if that was intentional or not. The OP is this manly rollercoaster of a ride. When I hear, ""MOERU FIRE! TATAKAI!"" My pussy starts dripping like a faucet. Awesome visuals of Noboru beating up the student body and looking like a badass. He\'s even standing on top of cliffs with huge explosions going off in the background! What\'s not to love!? There isn\'t much to talk about because of the small amount of content, but this is most certainly a must-watch. It\'s not even an hour long. Go watch it! By the way, as I was writing this review, I read the entire Honno no Tenkousei manga. I decided to make a mini review connecting the OVA to the manga, because if I made a separate review the manga review would be a paragraph long.

The first arc is the Volleyball arc, which is just as fun and chaotic as the OVA. The second is the Boxing arc. I don\'t have to explain myself for that one. After that arc, the story starts to become more complicated and boring, which doesn\'t really fit this manga at all. It goes from this fun, hyperactive manga to this uninteresting and somewhat slow paced manga. The manga is still good overall, but those later arcs didn\'t engage me like the first two did. The Black Takizawa arc was especially lame. I always found the evil clone concept to be unoriginal and stupid. And the Go Nagai thing from earlier wasn\'t intentional.

And of course, they use every cliche in the book like the nonsensical romance, super attacks, the speaker for the fight, the rival who cheats, etc...But what make this show works is that...they know how and when to use  their jokes: they don\'t overwhelm you with jokes every two seconds (like many bad ""spoof"" movies) which is a good thing. They know when to have jokes and when to have some so called ""serious"" moments; to the point that I was, for a few moment, legitimately into the story. I even was rooting for the main character at some point which is impressive since he is a massive idiot. I actually wish we had more episodes to see the other vilains the opening showed us and to spend more time with the serie...Really it\'s the combination between being at both a parody and an homage that makes Honoo to Tenkousei work. It\'s not the best serie ever made, sure, but it\'s a fun watch and everyone should give it a shot! they know how and when to use  their jokes: they don\'t overwhelm you with jokes every two seconds (like many bad ""spoof"" movies) which is a good thing.

It\'s downright hilarious.Animation is of course rough like I said earlier, and a lot of things feel like they could use polish. Which...is a bit weird for a Gainax anime. I\'m used to them blowing their budget on the stupidest things and having to render every other scene in flash or do the final few episodes using storyboards and Crayola markers.I think the biggest thing going for it is that its only two episodes, if it was any longer the jokes would be played out and everyone would get sick of it.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything.

Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Heck, the last installment of the Children\'s Card Games Saga was back in October, so it\'s high time to let loose on what was the most kick ass movie of 2004.Never mind Kill Bill vol. 2,...Harry Schlocker and the Prisoner of the Theater, Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 (the last watchable one before that series died), The Aviator, or Mean Girls...

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game.

The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades.

The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus.

Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

This man is Seto ""Rich Homie Mullet"" Kaiba. Armed with his combination of a crippling preoccupation of beating a high school kid at a card game and infinite wealth; so much wealth that he builds a physics breaking VTOL jet that has functional legs for landing gear, after his favorite playing card and also constructs YET ANOTHER CITY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FIGHTING YUGI!Kaiba boy, still extremely pissy over losing to Yugi boy in the Battle City arc of Duel Monsters (surprise, an entire city devoted to card games, centered around Yugi boy) strong-arms the fabulous fan favorite snark monster, moe anime obsessed Maximillion Pegasus into giving up his secret weapon to beat Yugi\'s God Cards.No it\'s not his dandy style, red suit, red wine, and vanity.It\'s, you guessed it. A heretofore unseen card! (side note: Pegasus really makes the movie though, because his campiness and incredibly sarcastic dialogue is turned up to 11 in this one, savagely mocking Kaiba at every turn and actually being a good sport for once.)Meanwhile, back at school, everyone wants a piece of Yugi since he\'s a  famous duelist now. So while Tristan and Joey cover, Tea and Yugi go to the one place the gamer geeks would NEVER look for them- a history museum with a very conveniently placed brand new exhibit on ANCIENT EGYPT!Here\'s where the story takes a turn for the Scooby Doo, and falls right off.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything.

Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Heck, the last installment of the Children\'s Card Games Saga was back in October, so it\'s high time to let loose on what was the most kick ass movie of 2004.Never mind Kill Bill vol. 2,...Harry Schlocker and the Prisoner of the Theater, Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 (the last watchable one before that series died), The Aviator, or Mean Girls...

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game.

The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades.

The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus.

Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

This man is Seto ""Rich Homie Mullet"" Kaiba. Armed with his combination of a crippling preoccupation of beating a high school kid at a card game and infinite wealth; so much wealth that he builds a physics breaking VTOL jet that has functional legs for landing gear, after his favorite playing card and also constructs YET ANOTHER CITY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FIGHTING YUGI!Kaiba boy, still extremely pissy over losing to Yugi boy in the Battle City arc of Duel Monsters (surprise, an entire city devoted to card games, centered around Yugi boy) strong-arms the fabulous fan favorite snark monster, moe anime obsessed Maximillion Pegasus into giving up his secret weapon to beat Yugi\'s God Cards.No it\'s not his dandy style, red suit, red wine, and vanity.It\'s, you guessed it. A heretofore unseen card! (side note: Pegasus really makes the movie though, because his campiness and incredibly sarcastic dialogue is turned up to 11 in this one, savagely mocking Kaiba at every turn and actually being a good sport for once.)Meanwhile, back at school, everyone wants a piece of Yugi since he\'s a  famous duelist now. So while Tristan and Joey cover, Tea and Yugi go to the one place the gamer geeks would NEVER look for them- a history museum with a very conveniently placed brand new exhibit on ANCIENT EGYPT!Here\'s where the story takes a turn for the Scooby Doo, and falls right off.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything.

Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Heck, the last installment of the Children\'s Card Games Saga was back in October, so it\'s high time to let loose on what was the most kick ass movie of 2004.Never mind Kill Bill vol. 2,...Harry Schlocker and the Prisoner of the Theater, Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 (the last watchable one before that series died), The Aviator, or Mean Girls...

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game.

The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades.

The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus.

Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

This man is Seto ""Rich Homie Mullet"" Kaiba. Armed with his combination of a crippling preoccupation of beating a high school kid at a card game and infinite wealth; so much wealth that he builds a physics breaking VTOL jet that has functional legs for landing gear, after his favorite playing card and also constructs YET ANOTHER CITY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FIGHTING YUGI!Kaiba boy, still extremely pissy over losing to Yugi boy in the Battle City arc of Duel Monsters (surprise, an entire city devoted to card games, centered around Yugi boy) strong-arms the fabulous fan favorite snark monster, moe anime obsessed Maximillion Pegasus into giving up his secret weapon to beat Yugi\'s God Cards.No it\'s not his dandy style, red suit, red wine, and vanity.It\'s, you guessed it. A heretofore unseen card! (side note: Pegasus really makes the movie though, because his campiness and incredibly sarcastic dialogue is turned up to 11 in this one, savagely mocking Kaiba at every turn and actually being a good sport for once.)Meanwhile, back at school, everyone wants a piece of Yugi since he\'s a  famous duelist now. So while Tristan and Joey cover, Tea and Yugi go to the one place the gamer geeks would NEVER look for them- a history museum with a very conveniently placed brand new exhibit on ANCIENT EGYPT!Here\'s where the story takes a turn for the Scooby Doo, and falls right off.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything.

Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Heck, the last installment of the Children\'s Card Games Saga was back in October, so it\'s high time to let loose on what was the most kick ass movie of 2004.Never mind Kill Bill vol. 2,...Harry Schlocker and the Prisoner of the Theater, Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 (the last watchable one before that series died), The Aviator, or Mean Girls...

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game.

The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades.

The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus.

Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

This man is Seto ""Rich Homie Mullet"" Kaiba. Armed with his combination of a crippling preoccupation of beating a high school kid at a card game and infinite wealth; so much wealth that he builds a physics breaking VTOL jet that has functional legs for landing gear, after his favorite playing card and also constructs YET ANOTHER CITY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FIGHTING YUGI!Kaiba boy, still extremely pissy over losing to Yugi boy in the Battle City arc of Duel Monsters (surprise, an entire city devoted to card games, centered around Yugi boy) strong-arms the fabulous fan favorite snark monster, moe anime obsessed Maximillion Pegasus into giving up his secret weapon to beat Yugi\'s God Cards.No it\'s not his dandy style, red suit, red wine, and vanity.It\'s, you guessed it. A heretofore unseen card! (side note: Pegasus really makes the movie though, because his campiness and incredibly sarcastic dialogue is turned up to 11 in this one, savagely mocking Kaiba at every turn and actually being a good sport for once.)Meanwhile, back at school, everyone wants a piece of Yugi since he\'s a  famous duelist now. So while Tristan and Joey cover, Tea and Yugi go to the one place the gamer geeks would NEVER look for them- a history museum with a very conveniently placed brand new exhibit on ANCIENT EGYPT!Here\'s where the story takes a turn for the Scooby Doo, and falls right off.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything.

Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Heck, the last installment of the Children\'s Card Games Saga was back in October, so it\'s high time to let loose on what was the most kick ass movie of 2004.Never mind Kill Bill vol. 2,...Harry Schlocker and the Prisoner of the Theater, Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 (the last watchable one before that series died), The Aviator, or Mean Girls...

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game.

The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades.

The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus.

Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

This man is Seto ""Rich Homie Mullet"" Kaiba. Armed with his combination of a crippling preoccupation of beating a high school kid at a card game and infinite wealth; so much wealth that he builds a physics breaking VTOL jet that has functional legs for landing gear, after his favorite playing card and also constructs YET ANOTHER CITY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FIGHTING YUGI!Kaiba boy, still extremely pissy over losing to Yugi boy in the Battle City arc of Duel Monsters (surprise, an entire city devoted to card games, centered around Yugi boy) strong-arms the fabulous fan favorite snark monster, moe anime obsessed Maximillion Pegasus into giving up his secret weapon to beat Yugi\'s God Cards.No it\'s not his dandy style, red suit, red wine, and vanity.It\'s, you guessed it. A heretofore unseen card! (side note: Pegasus really makes the movie though, because his campiness and incredibly sarcastic dialogue is turned up to 11 in this one, savagely mocking Kaiba at every turn and actually being a good sport for once.)Meanwhile, back at school, everyone wants a piece of Yugi since he\'s a  famous duelist now. So while Tristan and Joey cover, Tea and Yugi go to the one place the gamer geeks would NEVER look for them- a history museum with a very conveniently placed brand new exhibit on ANCIENT EGYPT!Here\'s where the story takes a turn for the Scooby Doo, and falls right off.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything.

Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Heck, the last installment of the Children\'s Card Games Saga was back in October, so it\'s high time to let loose on what was the most kick ass movie of 2004.Never mind Kill Bill vol. 2,...Harry Schlocker and the Prisoner of the Theater, Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 (the last watchable one before that series died), The Aviator, or Mean Girls...

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game.

The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades.

The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus.

Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

This man is Seto ""Rich Homie Mullet"" Kaiba. Armed with his combination of a crippling preoccupation of beating a high school kid at a card game and infinite wealth; so much wealth that he builds a physics breaking VTOL jet that has functional legs for landing gear, after his favorite playing card and also constructs YET ANOTHER CITY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FIGHTING YUGI!Kaiba boy, still extremely pissy over losing to Yugi boy in the Battle City arc of Duel Monsters (surprise, an entire city devoted to card games, centered around Yugi boy) strong-arms the fabulous fan favorite snark monster, moe anime obsessed Maximillion Pegasus into giving up his secret weapon to beat Yugi\'s God Cards.No it\'s not his dandy style, red suit, red wine, and vanity.It\'s, you guessed it. A heretofore unseen card! (side note: Pegasus really makes the movie though, because his campiness and incredibly sarcastic dialogue is turned up to 11 in this one, savagely mocking Kaiba at every turn and actually being a good sport for once.)Meanwhile, back at school, everyone wants a piece of Yugi since he\'s a  famous duelist now. So while Tristan and Joey cover, Tea and Yugi go to the one place the gamer geeks would NEVER look for them- a history museum with a very conveniently placed brand new exhibit on ANCIENT EGYPT!Here\'s where the story takes a turn for the Scooby Doo, and falls right off.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything.

Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Heck, the last installment of the Children\'s Card Games Saga was back in October, so it\'s high time to let loose on what was the most kick ass movie of 2004.Never mind Kill Bill vol. 2,...Harry Schlocker and the Prisoner of the Theater, Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 (the last watchable one before that series died), The Aviator, or Mean Girls...

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game.

The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades.

The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus.

Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

This man is Seto ""Rich Homie Mullet"" Kaiba. Armed with his combination of a crippling preoccupation of beating a high school kid at a card game and infinite wealth; so much wealth that he builds a physics breaking VTOL jet that has functional legs for landing gear, after his favorite playing card and also constructs YET ANOTHER CITY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FIGHTING YUGI!Kaiba boy, still extremely pissy over losing to Yugi boy in the Battle City arc of Duel Monsters (surprise, an entire city devoted to card games, centered around Yugi boy) strong-arms the fabulous fan favorite snark monster, moe anime obsessed Maximillion Pegasus into giving up his secret weapon to beat Yugi\'s God Cards.No it\'s not his dandy style, red suit, red wine, and vanity.It\'s, you guessed it. A heretofore unseen card! (side note: Pegasus really makes the movie though, because his campiness and incredibly sarcastic dialogue is turned up to 11 in this one, savagely mocking Kaiba at every turn and actually being a good sport for once.)Meanwhile, back at school, everyone wants a piece of Yugi since he\'s a  famous duelist now. So while Tristan and Joey cover, Tea and Yugi go to the one place the gamer geeks would NEVER look for them- a history museum with a very conveniently placed brand new exhibit on ANCIENT EGYPT!Here\'s where the story takes a turn for the Scooby Doo, and falls right off.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did. So, critically speaking, it's not as impressive or moving as it could be... but I definitely had nostalgia for it, and was surprised to realize just how much of it I remembered in detail. you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

The trailer was great.But as for the movie, although I did “enjoy” it, I was disappointed. The movie was a duel between Kaiba and Yugi, we’ve seen this a million times, and Kaiba has lost a million times,try something new.There is an Evil (Anubis) living inside Yugi’s item (Millennium Puzzle) and he uses this duel as a means to escaping.Small Yugi and his friends are sucked into the item were they come across zombie mummies.So eventually the duel...is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi. Yugi saves the world from darkness again, so un-original.The good things about this movie: Pegasus has a cameo, new cards are introduced…well that’s about it.I enjoyed it because I'm a Yugioh fan, but I didn't feel like this movie was theatre worthy. is interrupted by Anubis at the end of the movie and he duels Yugi.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

What happens next? Do I even need to say?You guessed it. As soon as Yugi and Tea and the creepy pervert Grandpa spot the gold sarcophagus and valuable artifact, BOOOOOOOOOOOM!

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything.

Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus. "", ""The plot had potential, with an evil sorcerer named Anubis awakening from a 5000-year-old sleep and seeking to destroy the world with the help of the Pyramid of Light, the 8th Millennium Item. Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series. The Pyramid of Light and Anubis were never mentioned again, and the cards seen in the movie were never seen again, either.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

Have a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, a lot of parts in the film felt pretty blank. The battle was average, it could have been better. All the characters who appeared in the movie were given enough screen time. And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring.

Yuugi is too preachy and dramatic (I watched the version with Dan Green, I don't think there is japanese one), Kaiba is too sadistic, Pegasus is too crazy and Anubis is a bad villain.Action scenes with mummies and Jonouchi, Honda and Yuugi could've been fun, but they were in there too long.

Heck, the last installment of the Children\'s Card Games Saga was back in October, so it\'s high time to let loose on what was the most kick ass movie of 2004.Never mind Kill Bill vol. 2,...Harry Schlocker and the Prisoner of the Theater, Shrek 2, Spiderman 2 (the last watchable one before that series died), The Aviator, or Mean Girls...

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game.

The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades.

The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be.

It's really entertaining, the theming for the most part was pretty good, the monsters where awesome, and the sound and music blew my balls off, but compared to the actual series, it was kinda lame.Though I will  say that the movie's artwork and animation where all really well done, for the most part, it got really boring when Anubis stepped in, and in my opinion, even Kaiba's duel...with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series. Kaiba destroyed half of Yugi's deck with his Deck Destruction Virus, (Which is the most OP card I've ever seen, might I add) so there was no real chance for Yugi to show off his cards and strategies. And according to the Deck list on Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki, I'd say that's pretty sad.I like that they tried to bring it closer to the actual game, but somehow, it makes it less fun to watch. Yugi pulled off so many cool strategies in the show, but in this one, he was pretty much backed into a corner the entire time until the final battle with Anubis (Who wasn't as intimidating as he was made out to be earlier in the movie).Overall, it's a really fun movie from my childhood, and worth the watch, but less fulfilling then the series, if you ask me. with yugi wasn't as fun as it was to watch in the series.

And boy did watching it again bring back memories. (Mostly of my parents' extremely unimpressed faces as we left the theater.) I think what struck me most... was that I basically got the same thing out of it watching it today as I did watching it over and over again as a kid, back when I didn't have the comprehensive understanding of the show it's based on that I do now. Which is not exactly a compliment, if...you think about it...This struck me as the sort of movie that you could watch in place of the series itself. Obviously, you wouldn't get the whole story, but you'd get enough. It does sum up the premise of the series and include all the major points you would have absorbed if you'd been actually watching the series, even just casually: The whole thing being driven by a combination of Yugi's connection to the spirit of an ancient pharaoh and Kaiba's pride. All their ridiculous problems ultimately being solved by winning a card game--or, at least, the monsters from that game coming to life in this case. The huge emphasis on the group's friendship and how it can overcome just about everything. So I mean, it was faithful to the show it was based on, at least, but it really doesn't build on that show in any meaningful way. I could see this movie being created just to try and draw in a new audience of fans-- and wouldn't be surprised to learn that it was. There are very few anime movies I can think of that got big, advertised theater releases like this one did.

Art and animation were good and fitting for a theatrical movie from 2004. For the plot, it's the revived-ancient-enemy-wanting-to-destroy-the-main-character type, and it's advised to watch this after watching the anime tv series Yu-gi-oh! Duel Monsters up until Battle City arc. As always, Kaiba's still obsessed of defeating Yugi, power of friendship, and of course, the hilarity of Pegasus' engrish. I also felt that the duel between Yami Yugi and Anubis was kinda underwhelming.One thing to note of, the card layout in this movie mirrors that of the present day, real world yu-gi-oh cards, so I guess it's a plus.

Yugi and his friends must enter the Millennium Puzzle to defeat Anubis and battle mummies along the way. It would have been watchable if the movie had focused on this storyline.Unfortunately, the movie was ruined by the inclusion of Seto Kaiba, who drove the plot with his obsession to beat Yugi. Even Anubis, the supposed villain, only appeared for a brief moment. The movie combined two good elements, a card game, and...an undead evil, but failed to create anything worthwhile. It was like watching the cast of The Mummy playing poker.I found the movie disappointing, and it contributed nothing to the anime. In fact, it created a huge plot hole by mentioning that Yugi had been dueling for three years, which contradicts the main series.

I guess there\'s no better place to start than with the movie...well OK, the show is a much better place to start, but I haven\'t finished the show yet. Anyways, on to the review.Story: The story isn\'t much more than what you\'d expect from your typical episode of the show. There\'s a duel between two characters and someone possessing something or used to live in the ancient past is somehow involved. It\'s not terrible, but there is a concept of the story that seems like it would have played a bigger part, but got...scraped during development. During most of the beginning of the movie after the title sequence, it looks like the movie\'s going to be about Yugi facing off against a bunch of duelists that believe they can take him down. Then just drops it in order to fully introduce the main antagonist, or at least he tries to be, but I\'ll get to that a bit more later. As for any final complaints, I could have done without them constantly repeating ""It was never to happen and for 5000 years it never did"" over and over again at the beginning.Art: The art for this film is a bit more detailed than the show, but not to any really breath-taking degree. They just used some sharper colors and shades. It\'s not necessarily bad, I definitely like the art of the show, but I\'ve seen better in other anime movies based off a show.Sound: The sound is actually pretty good. Before I get more into it, I watch dubs and not subs, so most of what I\'m talking about is in the American release of the film. The voice actors do a decent enough job with major props going to Dan Green for the emotion and energy he put into Yami\'s voice along with Scottie Ray for making Anubis actually sound threatening, until he starts talking about destroying the world with monsters from a children\'s card game. There\'s not much you can do about that though, other villains from the show suffer the same issue. The soundtrack is also pretty good with some memorable songs.Character: This is where I\'m a bit mixed on the movie. Yami and Kaiba are great characters and are portrayed well in the movie without loosing what made them who they are from the show. However, everyone else isn\'t given the same care. Anubis, while sounding threatening, falls under the cliche villain list since all he really wants to do is, what else, take over the world. He also doesn\'t really do much. Yeah, he shows up at the beginning to place some cards in Pegasus\' deck, but then you can pretty much forget that he ever existed until about the last 10-15 minutes of the film. This whole movie could have been about an awesome duel between Kaiba and Yugi/Yami and if you cut out Anubis, that\'s basically what it is. There\'s also just some really bad writing going on for Joey and the minor characters that he duels against. Look, Yugioh may be a great series in my eyes, but a Godfather reference isn\'t going to work here.Enjoyment: I loved this movie as a child, especially when I saw it in theaters, but now that I\'m older, while I still find it more entertaining than other anime films, I\'d rather skip over most of the Anubis stuff and get right to the great music and dueling. scraped during development.

And we also saw a special card and it was so good. the villain in this movie was also not good as a character and didn't give justice to his villain part.In this movie, I mainly liked the end part where that special card is revealed. It...was fun to see that. was fun to see that."", ""I love this movie so much because it was part of my childhood, but putting affection aside (if that's possible), it had what it needed to have to be an acceptable anime movie: the story is the minimum the movie needed, the characters are worked in a basic cliche level (no one seems to evolve), the sound effects are okay but the movie OST was sooo different from the anime, with a different style and little clips during the movie that I did find cool but I think they don't fit the anime in general so well. The art was very good, the animation is...good, the new monster designs are good. Despite the story and the villain being less than they could be, still today I find this movie quite enjoyable because the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the characters are as dramatic as they can be. I really enjoyed the interaction of some characters like Kaiba, Pegasus and Yugi, I loved seeing the God Cards once again, I loved the new dragon and the new magician, and the movies does have a good pace so it's not tiring. Considering the public it aims and the interest of selling the card game, it's quite successful, it is interesting and it makes me want to play the card game, the duels are fun, the monsters are cool and the main characters are awesome. good, the new monster designs are good.
