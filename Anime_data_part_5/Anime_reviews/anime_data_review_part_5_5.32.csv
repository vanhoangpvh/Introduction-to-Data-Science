Shukufuku no Campanella: La Campanella Della Benedizione,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9924/Shukufuku_no_Campanella__La_Campanella_Della_Benedizione,"[""It does as it intended to do, provide pure fanservice. Includes all (literally) the characters in some sort of fanservicey way. If you like the characters in this anime (no matter what gender) and you wanted to see more of them, then its for you.Artwise, its the same as the parent series. Nothing exceptional, but not lackingLikewise, for sound, is also borrowed from the parent series. Explosions sound like explosions.It really doesn't feel like an OVA, more like a series of shorts bundled together. Of course, the shorts have a coherent story in them.All in all, I consider it better than the parent series...because it does what it needed to do and a little more. because it does what it needed to do and a little more.""]"
Shoujo Shuumatsu Jugyou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36468/Shoujo_Shuumatsu_Jugyou,"['*Note*You should not watch this special before watching the main series as it brings in characters that appear and will spoil some moments.Shoujo Shuumatsu Jugyou is pretty much a small side-story that involves characters that appear throughout the series. Set in a school with Yuuri and Chito. Each episode is short discussing a similar subject or event that happened in the episode of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou. The art is more ""cartoony"" than the original series.If you enjoyed the original series then this is something cute that you should enjoy. I would recommend that you watch this alongside the original. ', 'This is a cute little addition to Girls Last Tour. I enjoyed the main series and this takes elements and characters from it to make this 90-120 second classroom based episodes. It is best to watch these after you have watched the twelve episodes of the main series. The characters in this are absolutely adorable, and even in their super-deformed state of drawing, the characters conversations and actions mimic the main storyline.As of February 24th 2018, if you would like to watch all 12 mini-episodes they can be found at the link below. English subtitles, high quality video. Just watch out for ads and popups,...they can be annoying.http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Shoujo-Shuumatsu-Jugyou- Viggetto they can be annoying.http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Shoujo-Shuumatsu-Jugyou- Viggetto', 'If you enjoyed the main show as much as I did, then this comes as a nice surprise. It’s basically just a little peak into an alternate reality where Yuuri and Chito try their best to explain and talk about some of the events in the show. It’s comparable to the extra panels in the manga that explain the world more, but done in a more humorous way. Each episode follows that episode of the show, so this can be watched either alongside the main series or afterwards.There really isn’t much else to say. If you liked the main show, and just want a little...bit of a goofy off-shoot, then this will be enjoyable. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but it doesn’t really need to be. bit of a goofy off-shoot, then this will be enjoyable. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but it doesn’t really need to be.', 'Shoujo Shuumatsu Jugyou is a collection of 12 1m long shorts that star chibi Yuu and Chi in a classroom where they learn about a random subject or maybe goof off. the teachers are sometimes characters from the parent show and sometimes just weird instead and there are small callbacks to the show as well. Its a fun, cute show with jokes and amusing animation. Def worth a watch after you are done with the parent show. Yuu force feeding chi booze to do a silly dance is a particular highlight!Presentation wise this is simple and effective, smooth chibi graphics and just enough detail to...look good make this easy on the eyes. The audible sounds when a character is surprised and the like also add to the impact. Good stuff.A note is to not watch this until after you are done with the main series. It contains references to events that will make sense after seeing the parent show. look good make this easy on the eyes.

Sore ga Seiyuu!: Petit Uchiage,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32993/Sore_ga_Seiyuu__Petit_Uchiage,"[""Seyuu Life was one of my favorite shows to come out this past year, something that really surprised me. But I just recently saw that there was an ova out, and decided to watch it, so wanted to leave my thoughts here since there hadn't been any other reviews made.The plot of the ova is that Futaba, Rin and Ichigo go to a hot springs. There is quite a bit of fan-service near the beginning which really wasn't needed. But then the girls are recognized as being Earphones, and are asked to put on a show for the other people there and they do....There really isn't anything that special about the story, it's just a special for people who liked the original show to see a little bit more with these characters. The one thing I really like about this ova is seeing how far these girls have come thanks to their hard-work, and this was shown really well.Character-wise there really isn't anything new here, it's just seeing more of the same likable characters as before, which I'm fine with. There really isn't any development or growth here, but that was handled well enough during the main show.Art and sound are the same as before. The moe style is done relatively well, and the soundtrack is okay. The song at the end was cool, but that was more trying to showing how far the girls have gone than being an amazing piece of music.So in summary...Pluses:I liked seeing more of these charactersI really enjoyed how they shows the success the girls have worked hard for.Cons:Fan-service really wasn't needed.Verdict:If you liked the main show, watch this. If you didn't, nothing special here. If you've never seen the main show, you really should at least give it a try.

Shounen Hollywood: Holly Stage for 50,https://myanimelist.net/anime/27741/Shounen_Hollywood__Holly_Stage_for_50,"['One word is all it takes to make any anime worthy to be watched: interesting. It’s simple. If you think it’s interesting, then watch. If not, then don’t. It all boils down in asking yourself: Is it interesting enough to make me watch it?So? What makes this anime interesting?Well, what is an idol? Is being an idol the right path to take? What does it takes to be an idol?  --- Just like my review for the first season, these are the questions that swirls around this second one.The episodes are mild and slow-paced, in a good way. This anime shows a...different angle of idols. The masses only see idols as they are on screen, on a poster or on a picture. They shine. They sparkle. They always smile like they don’t have any troubles. However, what happened before all of that? What kind of road could they have taken to get there? What kind of lives do they lead?The characters are fascinating especially, the five main characters. They aren’t boring at all since they have different personalities which blend well together. Each of them has quirks that make them interesting and stand out on their own. In addition, they are all eye-candies. Red, pink, blue, yellow and green… I couldn’t pick out a favourite out of the five.So? Is it worth it?Yes, I enjoyed watching this anime. Actually, I didn’t expect it to influence me this much. I’m so glad that I stumbled upon this show. I don’t mind watching the two seasons all over again. different angle of idols.

The story plot is still weak, but the storylines blend better together this time round. There are more details that made the transitions from one event to the next smoother. There\'s also a bit of direction in the story plot for this season (I can...hardly even spot anything close to a direction for season 1). There\'s also more focus on the ""Idol job"" which does brings out their animation quality better.Character designs have also slightly improved. There\'s a little more character development here in this season as well as the development of the group as a whole. The MCs have more actions and interacted with each other more naturally than the previous season. The new support characters are interesting, is just a pity that they are not make good use of by the story plot.Also because there is more actions for the group as idols, there\'s one aspect of the show that I am quite impress with. And that is the dance moves. The choreography and the songs matches really well, and the animation is good enough to present the characters\' dance movements smoothly to the audience. The dance movements certainly did brought my enjoyment level up for this show. Kudos to the production team to bring out the choreography so well in animation, and also kudos to the choreographer(s), I definitely liked how the moves complement the songs. hardly even spot anything close to a direction for season 1).

Shouwa Monogatari (Movie),https://myanimelist.net/anime/10013/Shouwa_Monogatari_Movie,"['This is a simple movie. There’s really nothing big going on in this anime. It’s a straight forward movie about the Yamazaki family during the 39th Showa Era or 1964. This was a significant year for Japan because this was the year Japan hosted the summer Olympics. This was a big thing for Japan because this was more than just the Olympics. It was also a way to reintroduce themselves to the world after cutting themselves off during WWII. The setting of the anime isn’t really that important and only subtle 1964 references are thrown here and there. I wish they did add more though...because the movie is too plain and too straightforward.The anime is about the family dynamic of the Yamazaki’s. It’s a laid back story full of typical family problems. It has the over protective dad, the rebellious children, the caring mother and every other typical family issues. There’s nothing grand in the way of the story and nothing really remarkable happen. It just nicely painted how a typical family interacts daily and it shows just how much they love each other. If I’d break the story to bits though, there’d be two plot points to the movie.The first one, and the one that had more focus, is about the daughter of the family going through her rebellious phase. It’s nothing remarkable. Yuuko Yamazaki, seventeen years old, is in love with this guy and she goes out with him without telling her family. They started worrying when she would say “I’ll go to the library” and then come home late into the night. Given the era, it’s natural that her parents would be mad because seventeen year old girls should be proper ladies and girls shouldn’t date so young. It’s pretty understandable for her age though to act out against her parents and do things she isn’t allowed to do. Nothing blows your parents top than your daughter dating an older guy.The Yamazaki family is patriarchal household and the father heavily scolds his daughter. The mother keep things calm and the daughter would just brush her parents off. Like I said, nothing awesome happens and the plot is pretty predictable.The second plot point is the changing times and the father’s craft work being threatened by change. His son insists to move on with the times but the father doesn’t budge. I guess this is where the 1964 setting is more prominent as well. Aside from the Olympics, the rise of western culture (the Beatles and the Ivy League fashion movement) and the introduction of bullet trains were among the changes happening during those times. The traditional era is slowly being invaded by technology and global culture. The lives of the Yamazaki family are being affected by this monumental change.The 1964 reference is pretty small though. This was a missed opportunity because this was a nice way to spice the anime up a bit. 1960s was also the decade Sakamachi no Apollon is set in and it was able to use it to give the anime some personality. It featured Christianity, foreigners walking the street and the heavy influence of the western culture. In Shouwa Monogatari, everything is pretty unspectacular. Sure it had bullet trains, the Olympics and western influences but it doesn’t really transport you to the era. It’s most just there as a backdrop for the story to function in. It’s such a shame because anime movies need to separate itself from regular airing series and they do so by being grand and awesomely conceived. This movie had none and it felt I’m watching a low budget anime series from 2002.The story made a nice comeback in the end though and the theme of family togetherness is nicely displayed. It doesn’t matter if your parents yell at you or if your daughters are turning into a grade A slut. At the end of the day, they’re family and family stick together and weather any storm. The story was sweet and I appreciate the subtle approach to something so simple and very relatable. That’s the main strength of the anime as well. The way you can relate to the characters and the family dynamic makes it a treat to watch the anime. It also proves just how strong a family bond is that viewers can relate to a 1960s family.4/10 “It’s plain and plain comes off as weak and weak is not really something you’d want to watch.” because the movie is too plain and too straightforward.The anime is about the family dynamic of the Yamazaki’s.

The character development of the Yamazaki family is the best part. From the daughter's struggles with first love to the simple experiences of boyhood through the son's perspective, Shouwa Monogatari emphasizes the bond between a loving but dysfunctional family. Surprisingly, the father gets decent screen time and proper character development (which is not often in anime movies). I loved watching this movie! Watched this movie when the 2020 Tokyo Olympics had to be postponed to 2021 caused COVID-19 and this movie made me appreciate the Olympic Games more and the hardworking people of Japan. ""]"

In these two episodes, they are completely different plots and the only similarity is that they contain the same four main characters. Other than that, they pretty much have nothing in common. You have to be ready for fast paced situations, quickly-changing storylines, and random jokes that rely on being self-aware about stupidity, sarcasm, and stupidity of the characters in general.The art got better, especially when compared to the first season, which I really...appreciate.The sound is a lot better than the first season.

To Heart 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/471/To_Heart_2,"['One can ask oneself the simple question; why?Why did I watch this? Why did I decide on writing a review when it is clear it is at the bottom of the ladder that all anime try to climb. I can honestly say I don\'t know. Maybe it\'s because I watched the original To Heart which was bad and I wanted to relive sitting through incredibly agonizing episodes filled with generic story, characters and screenplay. Most likely I watched it because I\'ve been watching some good anime lately and I decided it\'s time for some balance.I don\'t really know if I actually want to write a...review, per say, about this anime. You see, it is really bad, but then again so are almost all of the anime this anime try to look like. In truth Harem is probably the worst genre of anime, well maybe after ecchi. Never quite understood ecchi, either make a hentai or make real anime don\'t try to hybrid.To Heart 2 is one of the most generic anime you can find. It is thrown into the same bunch of quality productions such as; To Heart, To Heart remember my memories, Kono Aozora ni yakusoku wo, Amaenaide yo!, Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!! and more recent ones such as; Asu no Yoichi and Tayutama -Kiss on my Deity- and many, many, many more. Why do they make all of these generic fanboy animes one can ask oneself? The answer is simple! For the fanboys.There is always a demand for these kinds of anime, even the fanboys know that this is just like the 30 almost axactly similar animes they\'ve seen before, but since the art is slightly different, the characters are slightly different, the guy attends highschool instead of middle school or his name is Ken-chan instead of Hiroyuki-chan it becomes worth watching. Sometimes it isn\'t a robot girl either, sometimes it\'s an alien, or maybe even a mermaid!To Heart 2 is, as all of the aforementioned titles aswell as many I\'ve not mentioned here, one of the most predictable animes ever produced, but if it wasn\'t predictable then maybe something original could happen and we wouldn\'t want that! Oh no we wouldn\'t would we Ken-chan?Ken-chan: No we wouldn\'t!Have you ever noticed that even in fairly good shounen romance animes the guy is always clueless when it comes to himself and his feelings? ""Girl hugs guy, crying, but is too shy to say anything"" - ""Guy thinks to himself; why is she doing this, could this mean?.... no don\'t be stupid she probably just fell and got something in her eye and...""I mean really?

THANKS.', ""Well I watched To Heart 2 in just one day and overall I would give it a 6/10.There really isn't a base story, but all of the episodes are linked together in some way, even if the detail is very minor on how things are linked.This series isn't really about the romance or the drama, it's more about a high school guy getting picked on and being admired by lots of chicks.2 of the girls who liked him were always mean, while 2 others were shy, one was open with her feelings and another was like an older sister rather than a potential girlfriend. One...of the characters (Tama) will call Takaki: Taka-bou which roughly translates to Number One.Each character feels unique within the anime, but not unique in a sense of all animes ever made.The Romance to me felt really tacked on like it was just thrown in there with very little purpose, especially with the ending being very forgettable.The music was actually pretty decent in certain areas, however, there wasn’t much to listen to and definitely nothing worth mentioning.But don’t get me wrong, the series was definitely a slice of life and some parts were pretty hilarious, however, I started watching the series expecting romance and we didn’t get to that until half way through the series.The first-half of the series is pretty random, but they show how the episodes are related in certain ways, however minor the relations may be. Some lines are said in one episode and will be shown in a future episode on why that one character said that line.The second half of the series was were the romance started. It started between a set of twins and then grew between all of the female characters in the series, but nothing special really happens. It’s as if, this was made for little kids rather than teenagers. The romance was very light and nothing worth mentioning. Towards the end of the series all the characters get invited to a tea house, but the characters have to explain why they like/love Takaki (the main male protagonist) in order to be invited.The main drama of the series was with the twins (Sango-chan, Ruri-chan and Takaki). Ruri-chan was jealous about Sango-chan being in love with someone else. So Ruri-chan writes on all the black-boards at school that Takaki is a pervert and then even goes as far as to poison his food. But none-the-less she continues to hate him and scream her head off at him like a baby.The last drama of the series is between Takaki and his childhood friend Konomi. Konomi realizes that she is in love with Takaki, but he does not feel the same way about her.

I sat through 14 episodes (13 main episodes and a summary special) to have nothing really happen. To me it was just like watching an educational channel on TV, where nothing really happens and/or pertains to life today.But I give this series a 6/10.The art was pretty good, the music isn’t really worth mentioning, the story is kind of lame,  but the characters are pretty well thought out.With such an abrupt meaningless ending, I feel kind of cheated on the time I spent watching this anime. of the characters (Tama) will call Takaki: Taka-bou which roughly translates to Number One.Each character feels unique within the anime, but not unique in a sense of all animes ever made.The Romance to me felt really tacked on like it was just thrown in there with very little purpose, especially with the ending being very forgettable.The music was actually pretty decent in certain areas, however, there wasn’t much to listen to and definitely nothing worth mentioning.But don’t get me wrong, the series was definitely a slice of life and some parts were pretty hilarious, however, I started watching the series expecting romance and we didn’t get to that until half way through the series.The first-half of the series is pretty random, but they show how the episodes are related in certain ways, however minor the relations may be. Some lines are said in one episode and will be shown in a future episode on why that one character said that line.The second half of the series was were the romance started. It started between a set of twins and then grew between all of the female characters in the series, but nothing special really happens. It’s as if, this was made for little kids rather than teenagers. The romance was very light and nothing worth mentioning. Towards the end of the series all the characters get invited to a tea house, but the characters have to explain why they like/love Takaki (the main male protagonist) in order to be invited.The main drama of the series was with the twins (Sango-chan, Ruri-chan and Takaki). Ruri-chan was jealous about Sango-chan being in love with someone else. So Ruri-chan writes on all the black-boards at school that Takaki is a pervert and then even goes as far as to poison his food. But none-the-less she continues to hate him and scream her head off at him like a baby.The last drama of the series is between Takaki and his childhood friend Konomi. Konomi realizes that she is in love with Takaki, but he does not feel the same way about her. She runs off crying and hides from him with no real purpose and then suddenly the series ends.I don’t know about you, but to me that is kind of lame.

The anime was a big let down. I'd say the OVA'S were better then this. Its because toHeart2 deserved to have 24 episodes. 13 episodes isn't going to cut it. They took one gigantic chunk out of Konomi's story line and didn't even bother to finish any of the other girl's story lines. The anime was based on a visual novel, however, the anime was based on the Bad End route, where Takaaki is unable to get any of the girls. Its good harem wise but not so much for drama, since toheart2 was dramatic...in the VN.  If they'd made the same technique as Amagami SS, where they split the story by arcs, and showed the ENTIRE story of the girls, then this would be ALOT more interesting.

The Visual Novel of toHeart2 was EPIC. The story made me cry, laugh, and everything."", 'Funny, I watched the original To Heart before this (at the time, I believed ""To Heart 2"" to be another season of the original) and was hype as heck to watch this...only to discover it was something entirely different. And I LOVED it, but not as much as the original. I loved the original so much that I am still writing a draft for that review and it\'s not even close to completion.Anyway, not much to say about the core. Just another romance anime with a lifeless male lead designed to shoehorn you into buying the game it\'s based off of. And, well the original...To Heart made a male protagonist with some personality, this one is just as generic as any harem male lead out there; and it doesn\'t help that it had to take place after Love Hina, the anime that popularized the male lead being tortured. And appropriately enough, nearly half of the new cast of females do this, which is why I feel more negative towards it.One positive thing I will say about the anime itself was the use of the soundtrack. The soundtrack, for what very little they use of the actual piano segments, sound beautiful. Maybe the game has the same one, but if not, this anime has a splendid soundtrack and that is probably the highest number I gave was for its soundtrack, funnily enough.Beyond that stuff, you obviously are reading this review cause you want to know of the female characters! This review ain\'t for the anime, it\'s so that you get to know the female characters in the game before you play! Cause, well, this one felt a tad bit lifeless for me to take it too seriously, so it\'s mostly a calm review about the characters and, well, that\'s about it. If you want to know about the main lead, Takaaki Kouno, he\'s not very fleshed out at all and his role in the anime is basically to be the generic nice guy that suffers various torture porn from some of the girls as it progresses. So, similar to what Love Hina started.So, this character list will go from my most favorite characters to my least favorite. Sadly, I did not draft this or review it much before publishing it here, so my words might be a bit scattered since I finished this a while ago, but I did watch all the spin-off stuff as well as the extensions, so my memories of the original are a bit loose now because of this. Speaking of, I would give those a higher rating on the art cause they looked much more expressive in comparison to this one\'s rather bleak colorization. If this review is panned a bit much, I can just make another review on the next series that goes into fuller detail of everybody in case my sentiments here are mediocre.With that, let us begin. By the way, partial spoilers. You have been warned. Also, I will not be counting any girls introduced in the special episodes; rather, they will have their own section in the next half of the review. Only girls that appeared in the original To Heart 2. Also, probably not gonna count the mom or maid robot, either.Sango Himiyuri - What more can I say about this girl, besides her confidence being so overwhelming that she just upright decided to break the ""no kiss romance"" trope by straight up kissing our male protagonist the same episode she meets him! Yes, this guy actually gets some action, and she straight up admits she loves him! Well, ""love-love"" but you get the idea. I thought she was a breath of fresh air in contrast to the darker girls, as whenever she was in the scene, you couldn\'t help but smile.I love her personality, her appearance and the fact that she\'s probably the most normal female in the entire cast with her non-exaggerated reactions and appreciation towards Takaaki. Doesn\'t help that she is apparently a freaking genius, either! She can create robots and do most things science. In fact, she even curbs her little sister multiple times in a very mature manner, despite how simplistic she sounds when talking to Takaaki. With a personality as unique as hers, there was no way any other girl would be number one. She was fully tolerable and nearly every scene she is in is filled with smiles.Manaka Komaki - Oh yes, I assume for those whom have already seen this anime, you know my pattern now. This girl did compete with my number one spot, but I was judging the version of her that appeared outside the original To Heart 2, so that would\'ve been unfair. If we count the version of her that only appears here, she\'s a solid second place on the list.Sporting the warmest personality of the girls, Manaka is a very calm and delightful girl to listen to. Much like Sango, she sees more positive in Takaaki than negative; at least, in this particular series. She always listens to him and never exaggerates (often, anyway) anything, which I enjoyed a lot. Honestly, due to how little interaction she does have, or maybe it\'s cause my memory is a bit stale now since it\'s been a while since I saw the original, I can not really write much about her, despite her high placement. That\'s okay, though, cause she\'s still a fine character and most fans of To Heart 2 probably like her as well.Lucy Marioa Misora - What the hell, I thought she only went by ""Ruuko"" maybe they announced her full name on her debut episode, cause that confused the hell out of me.Um, anyway, this girl is just adorable. I actually admired the way this anime introduced the girls, as they actually start off as a character you see at least once in the background (there\'s a whole episode that brings this up, actually, for all of them), but I didn\'t think anything of her at that time. She\'s, by far, the most supernatural girl in the anime, as she can legitimately summon storm clouds and lightning from the sky (only does so one time, though) cause, well, she is very obviously revealed to be an alien. Her antics throughout are mostly comical, as she has minimal character development and little to discuss, beyond introducing the longest running gag in both the original anime and spin-offs, the ""Ru!"" line, which of course, Sango just HAD to use indefinitely every time she sees Ruuko (and sometimes Takaaki), which made me love Sango even more than I already did. But, I already talked about her, so let\'s move on.Konomi Yuzuhara - The last of the good characters, here is Konomi, a character whom legitimately sleeps in the same bed as Takaaki in the same episode of both her and his debut. Not sexually of course, but she was just scared of a horror movie and wanted comfort. It was quite adorable, but of course, now you\'re thinking ""this is the childhood friend"" well, you are correct. He does indeed refer to her by her first name, no honorifics attached, meaning he has the closest bond with her. Their relationship is honestly quite adorable, as it is indeed like they are siblings, but this adds a bit of drama to the anime later on.Her personality is likable if you like adorable characters, she has some good one-liners every now and then and, well, I did not pay much attention to her. Beyond her debut episode, which also introduced both her friends that she had to say goodbye to (though they are minor characters, so they are not counted in this), she becomes somewhat recurring from what I can remember. She was mainly there just to greet Takaaki and not do much else other than tease him, which was typical of the female childhood friend role. So, she\'s a fine character, and I would rather not put her lower on the list cause of what is sadly coming up next later on.Ruri Himeyuri - Here\'s the little sister I was talking about! She is basically Sango\'s exact twin, especially in this series where their hair color is lazily different from one another, with Sango\'s being slightly richer in blue, well Ruri\'s is slightly richer in purple, but a literal slight where, if you have poor vision, you\'d just say they both have a low saturated tone of blue. Thankfully, Ruri always looking angry will help you tell her apart from her big sister.Her character development is among the most intricate in the anime, but I won\'t go into too much detail to avoid spoiling the whole experience. Overall, she just loves her big sister a lot, but hates anybody that wishes to ""steal her away"" from her. As I said before, Sango did kiss Takaaki, but Ruri responded with an immediate (and quite unnecessary) shot to his groin, despite Sango initiating the smooch. Sango almost always scolds Ruri for being rude to Takaaki, but Ruri\'s selfish nature prohibits her from truly listening to her words.One last thing I\'d like to note about Ruri is that I\'m not entirely sure how she ""loves"" her sister, cause it turns into a bit of a twincest thing throughout their arc; most notably, during one scene where she touches Sango\'s lips (very slowly) with her fingers and then touches her own well closing her eyes (still quite slowly, and I think she moaned a bit, too). She even kisses Sango herself at the end of their arc, albeit only on the cheek. It confused me a lot as to how much she ""loved"" Sango, but as of now, I believe it might be between a sibling love and a romantic love. Maybe also cause, since she wants Sango to herself, she might be willing to go so far as to marry her so that she is not ""hurt"" by anybody. Kinda creepy, huh? But, those are the exact vibes I get from her character, mainly due to her extremely antagonizing ways towards Takaaki.Yuma Tonami - Close friends with Manaka, this girl has one of the most hilarious hate arcs in the whole anime. She is typical tsundere, but in the most cringe way possible. She first begins the streak by accidentally running into Takaaki, but blaming him for it and claiming it to be a challenge (second longest running gag in the anime, perhaps) and always wants to fight him. From what I could remember, I believe this hatred stemmed from family manners at home where, being unable to overt her true feelings towards the career she decided to study for, she perhaps takes out her hatred on Takaaki as a means to calm herself. That\'s what I got the idea from.But, again, another case of lack of character development other than her debut episode, so it\'s mostly laughs when you see her come into the scene, since her hatred is quite obviously the most forced tsundere mode in the entire anime.Also, outside the original, there\'s a small implication that she actually secretly loves Takaaki after they share a ""romance glance"" (where the music stops, flowers are in the background and she blushes well starring at him for a while), but that was a different series and I won\'t spoil how that happens. But, I thought I\'d bring it up to compensate for the little bit of information I wrote for her.Tamaki Kousaka - VERY close to being the last girl on the list, but not quite. Like Konomi, she has a childhood bond with Takaaki, giving him a pet name and is rather not afraid to get up and close with him. On her debut episode, when Takaaki is unfamiliar with who she is (apparently, she was gone for a while in her own school, alongside some of her classmates saying their goodbyes, whom you never see again in the entire anime), she teases him for a while till he figures it out. Straight away, she hugs him, slams him to the ground (despite how it looks, and the camera angles, this isn\'t romance, but a very hilarious reunion hug) and just rubs her face against his a lot well he\'s doing the ""Um, Tamaki?"" line well looking down all nervous.Coming off as very sweet thus far, you\'d think she\'d be higher up, especially since it\'s another one of his childhood friends. But, unfortunately, she has a bit of a yandere side to her. I guess it never came off to me right away, but near the end of the anime, it made sense. This will be a heavy spoiler, but I figure I should bring it up. It is implied that she loves Takaaki when they are children (she leaves him around this time, so he doesn\'t see her for years, I think) and so, well, she has a rather strange tsundere vibe around most of the girls in the anime, and it\'s quite condescending and overpowering.Most of what I\'m about to say next is kind of not done in this series, but was worth a mention since I did not wish to write multiple reviews of it. Throughout most of it this one, the original, her eyes will switch from innocent to devious (the sharp, thin looking eyes) whenever she is about to have her way, and she always does, which was a major turnoff to me since I didn\'t like that very much. But, in the next series, it is shown that her yandere mode is much worse, as she is apparently four hundred percent stronger than the average human (she stops the attack of a freaking robot) and this just proved to me that her character was mainly meant to be a kind of ""bring the balance"" character, since nobody could defeat her. Well...maybe one, but she\'s not in the original series.Overall, Tamaki is a rather peculiar character that\'s hard to love due to her condescending nature, but she is indeed the only one that wrote a real love letter to Takaaki (we find out more about this in the next series) and, judging from how she reacts around the other girls at times, she can kind of look like a cryptic yandere type of girl. It\'s hard to elaborate, but that\'s the best way I can describe her.Karin Sasamori - Quite honestly, I wanted to skip most of the girl reviews and just write about her, but since I knew that would be a rather poor writing of the anime, I had to include the other girls, too.Yes, this is the girl whom I consider to be the worst in the series and for multiple reasons. Despite not being as intimidating as Tamaki, Karin manages to do one of the lowest things in the entire anime. I honestly don\'t want to spoil how it all leads to this, since I will leave that up to you to watch.But, at some point, a sign falls on Takaaki and the ""anime accident"" occurs where the main guy just happens to have one of his hands on the female character\'s breasts as he fell. Taking advantage of the situation, Karin asks that he is bold (general running gag in most anime when a male lead goes in for a move) and, before Takaaki can remove his hand, Karin places it back on her breast, albeit harder. She then says if she were to scream in agony, everybody in the sports team (coincidentally right next to them, just outside the room window, doing warm-ups) would hear and his reputation as a man would be ruined.And thus, begins the third longest running gag in the anime where Takaaki has to aid her bidding or else she will ruin his reputation. With Tamaki, despite her tsundere ways, she still cares for Takaaki and wouldn\'t truly hurt him (she does, inadvertently, in the next series, but it was by accident), well Karin is the very definition of sadistic. Her character is just not likable to me and she has no redeeming traits aside from having the most normal hair in the group. I was gearing up to enjoy her when she debuted, until that episode went on.Even worse, she indeed enforces this on Takaaki, even when he\'s in the drama portion of the anime where something serious happened. Only once, I believe, does he get out of her bidding, but only cause a friend pulls him out of the room they\'re in. Otherwise, she also has her way like Tamaki most of the time, but the thing is, she doesn\'t care if he hurts him or not. And that made her the cruelest character in the anime. Cause both Ruri and Yuma admittedly like Takaaki, but in their own unique way. Offscreen, according to Sango, Ruri admits at home that she ""misses Takaaki"" sometimes; as to which, she does the obvious blush before talking, hinting the fact to be true. As for Yuma, well, not much happens there until that light spoiler I gave of the next series.Yeah, this review was...pretty lifeless. It was hard to be optimistic writing about this, cause the anime became a bit of an earful, among other things, as it progressed. I just began disliking it a lot, with a few notable exceptions such as Sango, Manaka and others really managing to have bright enough personalities to cheer me up. I would\'ve had more to write if I didn\'t wait so long, as it faded my memory of the anime and I wanted to just write something cause it had been a while for me.But, before I end things...there is one more girl in the bunch, one that apparently only has a cameo in a flashback sequence in this anime. Since she appears, though, and is considered a potential love interest for the main character (as a ""bonus"" according to what I saw, but was simply left out of the anime), I feel she counts.Yuuki Kusakabe - Honestly, if I count outside of this anime, this girl is probably my real third favorite...oh, who am I kidding, I\'ve already mentioned the next series enough already, I\'m not fooling anyone.She appears in a small flashback, revealing that she had to move away and also change her last name, so she could never see Takaaki again. As such, she is not necessarily a ""childhood friend"" of his, but close. She only ever got to interact with him for a little, but she grew close to him and, arguably, Yuuki is probably the girl that he has the most potential to date in the actual series as a whole. If you want to know more, you can read the last paragraph of her description or wait till you watch the next series.In the full version of the flashback, in a rather sweet way, Takaaki offers his last name to Yuuki so that he will never forget about her, saying she can go by ""Yuuki Kouno"" if she likes. This shocks the other girls in the next series, as this kind of implies that he proposed to Yuuki, and technically, inadvertently ""dated"" her before any of the other girls. It\'s pretty cute, honestly, but they only share one real heartwarming moment in the next series. Their interaction is also rather subtle, maybe cause the next series might take place a year later and, by this point, maybe he hadn\'t seen her in so long (want to say over half a decade by this point) that he just forgets about her. It\'s rather sad, really, but it also did not help at all that, in this series, she has teal(?) hair, well in the new one, it\'s black. Maybe they just couldn\'t write her character fully for the anime and she was more in a ""beta"" phase during that flashback. Either way, I enjoyed her in the next series a lot and, indeed, she would be my personal number three if this review wasn\'t bias towards the original series.So, that\'s the last of my sentiments towards To Heart 2. It\'s very vague, cheesy and this review wasn\'t fleshed out at all. In fact, due to the lack of free time I have to write this stuff anymore, I didn\'t really want to pour my soul into this, either. I\'m saving that for the original To Heart later on this month, if not the next. So, this is more of an opinion thing I have between all the girls.My final sentiments regarding the anime are that it would\'ve been better if it was made before Love Hina, like the original was, as it would\'ve allowed for better development, no tsundere bull and, well, less negativity perhaps. The drama was a welcomed idea, of course, considering how lighthearted the series before it is, but they do it in very strange ways; only becoming stranger in the next series.Hope you enjoyed the read, and look forward to my sentiments on the original To Heart! To Heart made a male protagonist with some personality, this one is just as generic as any harem male lead out there; and it doesn\'t help that it had to take place after Love Hina, the anime that popularized the male lead being tortured. And appropriately enough, nearly half of the new cast of females do this, which is why I feel more negative towards it.One positive thing I will say about the anime itself was the use of the soundtrack. The soundtrack, for what very little they use of the actual piano segments, sound beautiful. Maybe the game has the same one, but if not, this anime has a splendid soundtrack and that is probably the highest number I gave was for its soundtrack, funnily enough.Beyond that stuff, you obviously are reading this review cause you want to know of the female characters!

Sadly, I did not draft this or review it much before publishing it here, so my words might be a bit scattered since I finished this a while ago, but I did watch all the spin-off stuff as well as the extensions, so my memories of the original are a bit loose now because of this. Speaking of, I would give those a higher rating on the art cause they looked much more expressive in comparison to this one\'s rather bleak colorization. If this review is panned a bit much, I can just make another review on the next series that goes into fuller detail of everybody in case my sentiments here are mediocre.With that, let us begin.

So, she\'s a fine character, and I would rather not put her lower on the list cause of what is sadly coming up next later on.Ruri Himeyuri - Here\'s the little sister I was talking about! She is basically Sango\'s exact twin, especially in this series where their hair color is lazily different from one another, with Sango\'s being slightly richer in blue, well Ruri\'s is slightly richer in purple, but a literal slight where, if you have poor vision, you\'d just say they both have a low saturated tone of blue. Thankfully, Ruri always looking angry will help you tell her apart from her big sister.Her character development is among the most intricate in the anime, but I won\'t go into too much detail to avoid spoiling the whole experience.

That\'s what I got the idea from.But, again, another case of lack of character development other than her debut episode, so it\'s mostly laughs when you see her come into the scene, since her hatred is quite obviously the most forced tsundere mode in the entire anime.Also, outside the original, there\'s a small implication that she actually secretly loves Takaaki after they share a ""romance glance"" (where the music stops, flowers are in the background and she blushes well starring at him for a while), but that was a different series and I won\'t spoil how that happens. But, I thought I\'d bring it up to compensate for the little bit of information I wrote for her.Tamaki Kousaka - VERY close to being the last girl on the list, but not quite. Like Konomi, she has a childhood bond with Takaaki, giving him a pet name and is rather not afraid to get up and close with him. On her debut episode, when Takaaki is unfamiliar with who she is (apparently, she was gone for a while in her own school, alongside some of her classmates saying their goodbyes, whom you never see again in the entire anime), she teases him for a while till he figures it out. Straight away, she hugs him, slams him to the ground (despite how it looks, and the camera angles, this isn\'t romance, but a very hilarious reunion hug) and just rubs her face against his a lot well he\'s doing the ""Um, Tamaki?"" line well looking down all nervous.Coming off as very sweet thus far, you\'d think she\'d be higher up, especially since it\'s another one of his childhood friends. But, unfortunately, she has a bit of a yandere side to her. I guess it never came off to me right away, but near the end of the anime, it made sense. This will be a heavy spoiler, but I figure I should bring it up. It is implied that she loves Takaaki when they are children (she leaves him around this time, so he doesn\'t see her for years, I think) and so, well, she has a rather strange tsundere vibe around most of the girls in the anime, and it\'s quite condescending and overpowering.Most of what I\'m about to say next is kind of not done in this series, but was worth a mention since I did not wish to write multiple reviews of it. Throughout most of it this one, the original, her eyes will switch from innocent to devious (the sharp, thin looking eyes) whenever she is about to have her way, and she always does, which was a major turnoff to me since I didn\'t like that very much. But, in the next series, it is shown that her yandere mode is much worse, as she is apparently four hundred percent stronger than the average human (she stops the attack of a freaking robot) and this just proved to me that her character was mainly meant to be a kind of ""bring the balance"" character, since nobody could defeat her. Well...maybe one, but she\'s not in the original series.Overall, Tamaki is a rather peculiar character that\'s hard to love due to her condescending nature, but she is indeed the only one that wrote a real love letter to Takaaki (we find out more about this in the next series) and, judging from how she reacts around the other girls at times, she can kind of look like a cryptic yandere type of girl. It\'s hard to elaborate, but that\'s the best way I can describe her.Karin Sasamori - Quite honestly, I wanted to skip most of the girl reviews and just write about her, but since I knew that would be a rather poor writing of the anime, I had to include the other girls, too.Yes, this is the girl whom I consider to be the worst in the series and for multiple reasons. Despite not being as intimidating as Tamaki, Karin manages to do one of the lowest things in the entire anime. I honestly don\'t want to spoil how it all leads to this, since I will leave that up to you to watch.But, at some point, a sign falls on Takaaki and the ""anime accident"" occurs where the main guy just happens to have one of his hands on the female character\'s breasts as he fell. Taking advantage of the situation, Karin asks that he is bold (general running gag in most anime when a male lead goes in for a move) and, before Takaaki can remove his hand, Karin places it back on her breast, albeit harder. She then says if she were to scream in agony, everybody in the sports team (coincidentally right next to them, just outside the room window, doing warm-ups) would hear and his reputation as a man would be ruined.And thus, begins the third longest running gag in the anime where Takaaki has to aid her bidding or else she will ruin his reputation. With Tamaki, despite her tsundere ways, she still cares for Takaaki and wouldn\'t truly hurt him (she does, inadvertently, in the next series, but it was by accident), well Karin is the very definition of sadistic. Her character is just not likable to me and she has no redeeming traits aside from having the most normal hair in the group. I was gearing up to enjoy her when she debuted, until that episode went on.Even worse, she indeed enforces this on Takaaki, even when he\'s in the drama portion of the anime where something serious happened. Only once, I believe, does he get out of her bidding, but only cause a friend pulls him out of the room they\'re in. Otherwise, she also has her way like Tamaki most of the time, but the thing is, she doesn\'t care if he hurts him or not. And that made her the cruelest character in the anime. Cause both Ruri and Yuma admittedly like Takaaki, but in their own unique way. Offscreen, according to Sango, Ruri admits at home that she ""misses Takaaki"" sometimes; as to which, she does the obvious blush before talking, hinting the fact to be true. As for Yuma, well, not much happens there until that light spoiler I gave of the next series.Yeah, this review was...pretty lifeless. It was hard to be optimistic writing about this, cause the anime became a bit of an earful, among other things, as it progressed. I just began disliking it a lot, with a few notable exceptions such as Sango, Manaka and others really managing to have bright enough personalities to cheer me up. I would\'ve had more to write if I didn\'t wait so long, as it faded my memory of the anime and I wanted to just write something cause it had been a while for me.But, before I end things...there is one more girl in the bunch, one that apparently only has a cameo in a flashback sequence in this anime. Since she appears, though, and is considered a potential love interest for the main character (as a ""bonus"" according to what I saw, but was simply left out of the anime), I feel she counts.Yuuki Kusakabe - Honestly, if I count outside of this anime, this girl is probably my real third favorite...oh, who am I kidding, I\'ve already mentioned the next series enough already, I\'m not fooling anyone.She appears in a small flashback, revealing that she had to move away and also change her last name, so she could never see Takaaki again. As such, she is not necessarily a ""childhood friend"" of his, but close. She only ever got to interact with him for a little, but she grew close to him and, arguably, Yuuki is probably the girl that he has the most potential to date in the actual series as a whole. If you want to know more, you can read the last paragraph of her description or wait till you watch the next series.In the full version of the flashback, in a rather sweet way, Takaaki offers his last name to Yuuki so that he will never forget about her, saying she can go by ""Yuuki Kouno"" if she likes. This shocks the other girls in the next series, as this kind of implies that he proposed to Yuuki, and technically, inadvertently ""dated"" her before any of the other girls. It\'s pretty cute, honestly, but they only share one real heartwarming moment in the next series. Their interaction is also rather subtle, maybe cause the next series might take place a year later and, by this point, maybe he hadn\'t seen her in so long (want to say over half a decade by this point) that he just forgets about her. It\'s rather sad, really, but it also did not help at all that, in this series, she has teal(?) hair, well in the new one, it\'s black. Maybe they just couldn\'t write her character fully for the anime and she was more in a ""beta"" phase during that flashback. Either way, I enjoyed her in the next series a lot and, indeed, she would be my personal number three if this review wasn\'t bias towards the original series.So, that\'s the last of my sentiments towards To Heart 2. It\'s very vague, cheesy and this review wasn\'t fleshed out at all. In fact, due to the lack of free time I have to write this stuff anymore, I didn\'t really want to pour my soul into this, either. I\'m saving that for the original To Heart later on this month, if not the next. So, this is more of an opinion thing I have between all the girls.My final sentiments regarding the anime are that it would\'ve been better if it was made before Love Hina, like the original was, as it would\'ve allowed for better development, no tsundere bull and, well, less negativity perhaps. The drama was a welcomed idea, of course, considering how lighthearted the series before it is, but they do it in very strange ways; only becoming stranger in the next series.Hope you enjoyed the read, and look forward to my sentiments on the original To Heart!', 'In this review there are hints of mature language.So if you aren\'t old enough to buy beer.......Not your fault i know..But hey if you do happen to read it i\'ll not tell anyone...Do you know those tv ads,like don\'t eat meat,eat weed or don\'t smoke go for a run in the woods?Well i got one as well,smoke meth don\'t watch animes like this.You\'re probably reading this standing in front of your screen going:""what the fuck he\'s on about""..But wait..Recent studies show that watching 1 episode from animes like To Heart 2,basically your everyday harem-romance anime,it shortens your lifespan by 1 week.That means that after watching...an entire season you\'ve had it.If you\'re a dog that means you\'re already dead.Thanks Frisky for all the lovely memories.We will always remember all the joyous walks to the park,your barking as we parked the car.And it\'s your fault Frisky bought the farm.Cause if you fruitcakes stopped for a moment being such whiny little bitches we would have more animes like Elfen Lied and not this shit.You ruined the anime bussiness and now all we get is this romance/drama/harem crap that causes people serious death.And i don\'t care about people but what did Frisky ever do to you you little fucktards?And if you think that i\'m out of rants woohoooooo,i\'m so not.I\'m just starting with this bitch.To Heart 2....This must be the work of a mad scientist cause there\'s no other word for it,this is as lethal as a biological weapon.In fact there were rumours of entire villages ""mysteriously"" vanishing from the map around the time they were making this anime..I\'m not so sure it was THAT mysteriously lads.I think they kidnapped those poor souls,handcuffed them in front of a massive screen and showed them eps from this.Death was instant.According to some reports that were leaked their brains melted and their eyes had turned into this pure white cream.So how,you wonder,this dangerous thing made it onto our screens?It was thanks to a special task force team,joined together by the UN.They worked day and night to make sure it was suitable for broadcasting.But even they,the very best of them all,couldn\'t quite tame the beast.And we ended up with this hybrid.Part bio weapon part anime.Or in terms you can understand part UCT(Unholy Cancerous Trinity) aka Kanon,Clannad,Air,part Japanese fever.Story?Hasn\'t got one.It\'s the classic school setting where one lad gets all the women the other lad gets his dust and some free porn on the net to pass his time.Oh we also have a vast cast of women who have the hots for the first guy.And this is a known fact that the almighty god gifted him with so much testosterone that women were known to pass out after being drained from their bodily fluids.That\'s called the squirting phenomenon.Animation,you say?Well that my friends is where things get even worse than before.The purpose,in my mind at least,is to make the new anime better in every way than the one before that.Well in some areas it looks so much better than the previous effort which was a blatant copy of UCT.But because this was made by men tehy couldn\'t do many things at once so they only fixed some parts of the hideous animation like the huge foreheads for example.While doing that they forgot to make the animation look like it was a product of 2005 and this resulted in it looking like one that was made in WW2.Songs and VA?Well the songs are as always a mix of the pink vomit of unicorns and the turds of the care bears.As for the VA it was there to do one job..Being absolutely subpar.And now onto the last part..Them characters.This time round they decided to go fresh,start anew.So their first job wwwwwwwaaaaaaassss...A new freakin robot...I\'m not joking this also has a robot..Granted it doesn\'t play a major role but how lazy is that?If you\'re starting fresh ditch every single thing that made the previous 2 seasons such a waste of time.But at least i have to say that the rest of them are actually a tad better than the old folks.Mind you that doesn\'t say much.That like saying ""oh look i have aids which is better than Ebola cause i won\'t die in few days but in 2 years from now"".They are all the same shit you\'ll find in every other anime of this type.Nothing

understand why the story was all over the place and episodes were poorly linked together.Furthermore, this creates many 2 episode arcs for the girls in which the viewer obviously gets to learn about them and the creators try VERY hard to squeeze in as much as they can about this character and get them to grow feelings for the MC which makes the story all over the place since the newly introduced girl will just be used as a side character for the rest...of the show.Plot: 3/10Nothing to expect! Just the mc running into all these girls accidentky due to his kindness and hanging out with them. Surely nothing you\'ve seen before!!Pacing: 1/10Absolutely horrendous. I\'m aware that this is a harem and that the main character will  obviously have many girls over him, but it was atrocious for me to watch 8 possible love interests get their backstory and chemistry with the MC get squeezed in 13 episodes!Characters: 2/10Nothing interesting. The main character is your very typical harem MC who is kind to everyone and is very naive to girls\' feelings with that same generic character design. The girls were all very cliche and easy to read bc of their very one dimensional personality.The girls almost felt forced, for example Yuma just always picked fights with the mc because she thought he was ""challenging her"" as she clashed into HIM with her bike twice. She was obviously a tsundere so the creators tried to always keep her fuming and that\'s her main drive towards Takaaki. It was super unrealistic and immensly annoying as Takaaki would never even dare to correct her in this misunderstanding.Music: 4/10Background music was very simple and usually unnoticable. Opening and ending was very forgettable and I didn\'t find it very remarkable but that\'s individual.Animation: 3/10To Heart 2 is quite outa dated however The animation was actually apalling. It started off decent but towards the end I could really tell it was a bit rushed and usually the character dialogue wouldn\'t match the animation; at one point it felt like watching a powerpoint slide tbh. Yeah it felt fanmade- super choppy!So personally, To Heart 2 is a very bad spin off of To Heart and is deserving of a 4 for effort. I surely didn\'t enjoy it due to how generic and cliche it was, however if you truly want to experience this anime to its best- I suggest you give the visual novel a try as you could acc pick your own route instead if having them all dumped on you. of the show.Plot: 3/10Nothing to expect!

Hamtaro and his friends are getting really into a picture book that ends too suddenly for them, so they decide to act out the rest of the story.Meanwhile, the author who is frantically trying to finish the story sees them through a portal and decides to enlist their help whether they like it or not.Hamtaro and his friends are thrown into the world of the story and become the character within.Very fast paced and very non-sensical. This is not the kind of story you should go into planning to take seriously. There are...times in this movies that it feels like an acid trip. Things go by so fast, some of the most random things you can think of pop up and are gone before you know it.This movie is anything but predictable.It was a joy ride on the dorkiest roller coaster that ever lived.Art: 10The animators did a stellar job making every thing seem so big and grand. The characters are cute, their movements are fluid, the magic done in this world all look big and impressive.I have to imagine the people making this movie had a fun time making this film and it shows through the animation.Character: 7As always Hamtaro is just the best thing ever. I loved every moment with him on screen. I gave a rather low score for character for the last movie I reviewed for this franchise.The rest of the main cast just sort of followed Hamtaro around like a crew of robots with not much personality to them. It was much better in this film and more personalities were able to shine through... Though at the same time I can't help but feel it could have been a bit better for the rest of the cast. Especially when a major theme of this movie was friendship.The new characters were fun. I wonder if they ever show up again because I'd love to see more of them.Enjoyment: 10There wasn't a single point in this movie where I felt bored or thought the movie was dragging. Partly thanks to the fast pacing. I had some laughs, I had some WTF moments.It was an all around good time. Would most certainly watch again. times in this movies that it feels like an acid trip.

Windaria,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1130/Windaria,"['If you want pure literature in anime, something along the lines of Shakespeare and a true anime classic, then this it. It was previously released by Streamline and Harmony Gold in 1987, a year after its release in Japan originally under the title Once Upon a Time, but later re-named back to its original title. This anime tells a great tale of not just love and war, but about duty and loyalty to your family and yourself. The characters are captivating and unique, but I don&rsquo;t like what the Streamline version did with Izu. In the original Japanese version, Izu is more care free and...doesn&rsquo;t really fear for the worst, while in the dub, he&rsquo;s presented more as serious and is more idealistic and an older version of him narrates the story in the dub while there was no narration in the original Japanese version. Even though the changes present are significant in relation to the context, it doesn&rsquo;t overall deviate the intentions or violates the quality of this anime.The style and design for 1986 was far beyond its time. Though considered old school by our standards today, when you view it from the point of view of its original release, it just truly amazes me of how well detailed the characters and settings are. The designs like I said are not only detailed, but you&rsquo;re getting a huge range that isn&rsquo;t stylistically one-dimensional though they are archetypical. Of course you got the pretty looking girls like Marian, Izu&rsquo;s wife, and you also have the testosterone-taking Queen despite having a beautiful daughter. So I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s really no repetition to the design. Though I wouldn&rsquo;t say the art and animation is the same league of Akira, which came out a few years later, the execution of its respective concept just truly made it breath taking. But then again, they are different styles so you really can&rsquo;t compare them in that approach. The battle sequences aren&rsquo;t really at the levels of something like Braveheart but they do a good job of conveying how pointless and trivial the war between the two nations is. But some of the mechanical concepts in context to medieval setting of the story brings a Miyazaki like quality to it in both presentation and story telling.Despite significant script changes and characterization, the acting in the dub is still very superb and masterful. I say it&rsquo;s far superior to a lot of dubs to this day. The selected actors do a tremendous job of bringing their characters to life and you feel their portrayals. I don&rsquo;t really know the names of those involved in the dub, but I feel that these are the best-unknown dub actors you&rsquo;ll ever hear regardless of what was changed. But if you want to watch Windaria for the story it was intended to be told in, naturally you&rsquo;ll have to go to the Japanese version. I was able to distinct some iconic names. To start off, Izu is played by Furuya Tooru, most famous as being Amuro from Gundam, Seiya from Saint Seiya, and Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon. He&rsquo;s excellent in Izu&rsquo;s portrayal of being carefree and optimistic, while the English actor does a great job of portraying him as serious and realistic in context to the situation. And Inoue Kazuhiko, who is famous to casual fans of Naruto and to Narutards alike as the voice of Kakashi, also plays a huge role as Prince Jill who brings a unique kind of charisma to the character as he does with all of his roles. For the English dub, rather than script and dialog change as mentioned earlier, the execution is enough to be convincing that Windaria still shares its unique distinction in Japanese anime and animation as a whole.The soundtrack also accurately depicts the timeless romanticism that is demonstrated throughout this series as well as its fantasy setting. The Japanese track has a few insert Japanese pop songs that still capture what Windaria is all about.To conclude, I will address the outrage that some fans would have over the changes and omissions the English release has, and this goes for other anime throughout the 1980s such as Robotech and Voltron. You have to keep in mind that when those series came to America, there was really no official anime market at the time and this was the only way to have any direct exposure to Japanese anime. Fansubs weren&rsquo;t yet conceived and who the hell heard of subs vs dubs debates? I feel that Carl Maceck is in no ways an Al Kahn or a Haim Saban. Granted that Robotech upon initially watching it during its heyday didn&rsquo;t exactly tell you what anime was nor was it 100% a true American adaptation of its Japanese counter parts, I felt that Robotech nor was the American version of Windaria dumbed down to a point where it loses their unique distinctions rather than the fact they are from Japan. I still feel they tell excellent quality stories with realistic characters and a new way to view animation, though the why wasn&rsquo;t really there. While with 4Kids, they want to omit every Japanese reference as possible and their edits are just of course stupid and trivial to a point where it truly loses its distinction as an anime. But look at Ronin Warriors and Sailor Moon in English. Granted there were some changes, but Japanese references and settings weren&rsquo;t edited out. And hell, those two animes in their English versions kept their death scenes. I felt the English Windaria still retains its distinguishing qualities such as the presentation of Japanese values such as giri ninjo meaning duty and obligation in a more universal presentation with its fantasy setting. doesn&rsquo;t really fear for the worst, while in the dub, he&rsquo;s presented more as serious and is more idealistic and an older version of him narrates the story in the dub while there was no narration in the original Japanese version. Even though the changes present are significant in relation to the context, it doesn&rsquo;t overall deviate the intentions or violates the quality of this anime.The style and design for 1986 was far beyond its time.

But then again, they are different styles so you really can&rsquo;t compare them in that approach. The battle sequences aren&rsquo;t really at the levels of something like Braveheart but they do a good job of conveying how pointless and trivial the war between the two nations is. But some of the mechanical concepts in context to medieval setting of the story brings a Miyazaki like quality to it in both presentation and story telling.Despite significant script changes and characterization, the acting in the dub is still very superb and masterful. I say it&rsquo;s far superior to a lot of dubs to this day. The selected actors do a tremendous job of bringing their characters to life and you feel their portrayals. I don&rsquo;t really know the names of those involved in the dub, but I feel that these are the best-unknown dub actors you&rsquo;ll ever hear regardless of what was changed. But if you want to watch Windaria for the story it was intended to be told in, naturally you&rsquo;ll have to go to the Japanese version. I was able to distinct some iconic names. To start off, Izu is played by Furuya Tooru, most famous as being Amuro from Gundam, Seiya from Saint Seiya, and Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon. He&rsquo;s excellent in Izu&rsquo;s portrayal of being carefree and optimistic, while the English actor does a great job of portraying him as serious and realistic in context to the situation. And Inoue Kazuhiko, who is famous to casual fans of Naruto and to Narutards alike as the voice of Kakashi, also plays a huge role as Prince Jill who brings a unique kind of charisma to the character as he does with all of his roles. For the English dub, rather than script and dialog change as mentioned earlier, the execution is enough to be convincing that Windaria still shares its unique distinction in Japanese anime and animation as a whole.The soundtrack also accurately depicts the timeless romanticism that is demonstrated throughout this series as well as its fantasy setting. The Japanese track has a few insert Japanese pop songs that still capture what Windaria is all about.To conclude, I will address the outrage that some fans would have over the changes and omissions the English release has, and this goes for other anime throughout the 1980s such as Robotech and Voltron. You have to keep in mind that when those series came to America, there was really no official anime market at the time and this was the only way to have any direct exposure to Japanese anime. Fansubs weren&rsquo;t yet conceived and who the hell heard of subs vs dubs debates? I feel that Carl Maceck is in no ways an Al Kahn or a Haim Saban. Granted that Robotech upon initially watching it during its heyday didn&rsquo;t exactly tell you what anime was nor was it 100% a true American adaptation of its Japanese counter parts, I felt that Robotech nor was the American version of Windaria dumbed down to a point where it loses their unique distinctions rather than the fact they are from Japan. I still feel they tell excellent quality stories with realistic characters and a new way to view animation, though the why wasn&rsquo;t really there. While with 4Kids, they want to omit every Japanese reference as possible and their edits are just of course stupid and trivial to a point where it truly loses its distinction as an anime. But look at Ronin Warriors and Sailor Moon in English. Granted there were some changes, but Japanese references and settings weren&rsquo;t edited out. And hell, those two animes in their English versions kept their death scenes. I felt the English Windaria still retains its distinguishing qualities such as the presentation of Japanese values such as giri ninjo meaning duty and obligation in a more universal presentation with its fantasy setting.', ""The most frustrating movies to watch are the ones where a good director is trying to work with a garbage script, and I don't think there's a better example of this in anime than Windaria.  The characters are two dimensional at best, and their motivations rarely make much sense.  Why does the one kingdom want to invade the other?  Because they're evil, I guess.  Why do they think the best way to do this is to flood the city, thereby destroying anything of value within?  Who knows?  Why does the prince, who had previously been begging his father to...stop the war just keep it going once he has the power to stop it?  The movie tells you it's because he feels the pressure of tradition or something, but that was never concern to him until right then.The main arc is supposed to be about the protagonist joining the war, becoming corrupted, then regretting it.  The thing is, there's little if any reason for him to go through these steps.  He seems to just randomly decide that he wants to join the war, without even caring which side he joins.  When he gets to the city, he finds it a miserable place full of morons and assholes who treat him like garbage.  In a sanely written movie, this would cause the protagonist to doubt whether this was a good idea.  In this movie, he just becomes completely devoted to doing whatever they want, no matter the consequences. The result of this is not so much a story of a guy losing himself to ambition as it is one of a guy suddenly becoming a dick for no reason.Despite this, the movie looks nice and occasionally quite beautiful.  The late parts where the protagonist realizes the cost of everything even manage to be somewhat haunting.  Honestly, I almost wished I watched it in raw Japanese.  Whatever I thought was happening probably would have been better than what actually was, and I probably would have been more moved by some scenes without knowing the stupid, stupid context.With a better script, this could have been an all time classic.  As it is, it's one of the best attempts to polish a turd I've ever seen.  The director and animation team managed to keep it from being terrible, but even they couldn't make it good. stop the war just keep it going once he has the power to stop it?

Yes, the same studio that did the early episodes of Rurouni Kenshin. Like many of the other films I've reviewed during this year's film festival, it's not based on anything. It's also one I'd never heard of prior to browsing random anime films. So, was it worth dredging up? Let's take a peek and see.Story:We open with a young couple, Izu & Marin, taking their cart to sell their wares in the kingdom of Isa. Their idyllic time is ruined when someone tries to flood the city. An attempt which gets thwarted by Izu's intervention. Turns...out, the nearby kingdom of Paro has its sights set on the lands occupied by Isa. Izu and Marin find themselves in an awkward situation, with their village between the two countries. To make things more complicated, Prince Jill of Paro and Princess Ahnas of Isa are romantically attached. What will happen to these young pairs of lovers when war breaks out? Yes, it's one of those stories.There are a lot of problems with the narrative in this film. First of all, the warring kingdoms are both inexcusably stupid. Paro starts this whole conflict after clearly planning an offensive but they're also completely unprepared and undisciplined. They probably do as much damage to themselves through complete incompetence as Isa does to them. What kind of imbecilic leader gets into a rough situation with bugger all preparation? Putting King Trump aside, Isa is just as bad. After the whole near disaster at the beginning their “defence” against someone unauthorised messing with the gates that could flood their city comes down to giving one old guy a spear and some armour. Yes, Isa, that will keep your flood gates closed. It's a much better solution than proper guards working rotating shifts. Fecking morons. The film also suffers from adding completely pointless fantasy elements. We have a ghost ship that we see floating across the sky at different points. It contributes nothing. There are unicorns for, like, five seconds. There are spirits that we see take to the sky without actually doing anything. There's a forest with illusions which could be removed from the film completely without losing anything. You get the impression that Gallop wanted to craft a massive world with a lot of lore behind it, but the writing is too incompetent to do it well. There's also a general issue with the film taking a tired concept and not really adding anything of value to it. It's not horribly written, but the execution behind it is pretty bad.Characters:The characters are actually a pretty big issue here. This type of “lovers torn apart by conflict” narrative needs strong leads who we want to see find happiness in order to work. This film, however, gives us two pairs of really boring, flat characters. Maybe Fujikawa Keisuke thought that the potential for tragedy was a guarantee and he couldn't be bothered to flesh out the characters or their dynamics. Whatever the case, the consequence is that what should be a tragic tale transforms into watching a bunch of morons we have no investment in scramble around.Art:The artwork actually does look, for the most part, pretty good. There are some awkward facial expressions and movements here and there. Which is kind of to be expected of anime from that era. Actually, the fantasy elements of the film might solely exist to make the thing more visually interesting rather than as an incompetent attempt at world building. The action sequences are a bit weak too.Sound:There are some decent actors in this. Matsui Naoko (Dorothy Catalonia), Furuya Toru (Chiba Mamoru), & Inoue Kazuhiko (Yuki Eiri) have all given strong performances before. This is not one of those times. Listening to the acting in this is roughly equivalent to listening to a Junior High school theatrical production where they know the lines and they seem to be trying but they aren't very good. The music is pretty decent.Ho-yay:Honestly, this film doesn't have strong enough character dynamics for any of them to seem romantic. No, not even the main het ones. We  just know they're supposed to be romantic because the film outright says it and shows the occasional  kiss.Final Thoughts:Windaria is a pretty bad film. The narrative takes an old idea and combines it with poor execution. The characters are beyond bland. It's just generally a bit of a mess. My final rating is going to be a 3/10. That's all for this year's film festival week. Next Wednesday I'll look at Iria: Zeiram The Animation. out, the nearby kingdom of Paro has its sights set on the lands occupied by Isa.

The economy was flourishing, money was in abundance, consumers wanted and paid good for it, and it was the time when animators got really ambitious about what they wanted to create. Lots of great anime came from the eighties, like the original Macross anime (and it's Macekred version, Robotech), Magical Angel Creamy Mami, Little Princess Sara, Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind, Zeta Gundam, and, most notably, Akira. The eighties were also a time when anime began it's first journey to America, but not in one piece. Back then, it was the standard...to change names and storylines, re-arrange scenes or cut some out altogether, and market it only to kids, not teenagers and adults. Windaria was one of those titles. It was released by Harmony Gold (people who put together Robotech) under the name Once Upon A Time (No, not the live action show!) and apparently, similarly to Samurai Pizza Cats, they never got a properly translated script so they made their own one from scratch, much to the chagrin of hardcore fans. To this day, it has not been given an unedited English dub or a proper DVD release (Yoohoo! Discotek!). Anyway, I finally got to see it today, and...I have mixed feelings about it.It's like Record of Lodoss War in that two kingdoms are warring against each other, but the war itself doesn't break out until the second half of the movie due to rising tensions between the two kingdoms. There's another place called the Village of Blossoms which live near the Tree of Windaria, which the village people pray to when needed. One day, when Itha nearly floods, a man named Izu rushes to close the water gates, saving the town from disaster. But later on, a messenger from Paro invites him to help with a mission and be rewarded with a castle, riches, and women, even though he already has a wife named Marin and a pet Eevee-lookalike named Polipoli. He takes on the job, and Marin decides to wait for him, even as war comes closer. On the other hand, a prince of Paro, Jill (why does he have a girl's name? He's named Roland in the Harmony Gold dub), and a princess of Itha, Ahnas, are in love, and don't like the way things are going. But when war breaks out, things definitely won't be peachy keen for anyone.There's something I am DYING to get out of the way: I hate every single character, but I love how they're executed. Every major character follows some kind of archetype: the brash, adventurous young man, a meek, submissive girl, a rebellious princess, a bland prince who hates his kingdom, and an evil king. They don't get very much development, and never grow out of their stereotypes. The most egregious example is Marin, who, quite seriously, does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in the movie. All she does is sit around and do nothing while bad things are happening. She literally had absolutely no impact on the movie. Heck, you could cut her out altogether and nothing could be lost! Everyone else are just a bunch of one dimensional stereotypes. However! They all have one MAJOR saving grace that I feel the movie accomplished REALLY well: their flaws, and how they lead to their downfall. I won't mention anything for the sake of spoilers, but I absolutely LOVE how their major character flaws are completely realistic and actually have consequences for not just themselves but everyone else around them. Marin does nothing but sit around in a war torn village, Izu goes from one kingdom to another and becomes a money grubbing idiot when he defects to Paro, and Jill's hatred for his father clouds his judgment about the war. Their flaws drive the entire story, and not only do they make the entire story happen, when reality comes crashing down before them, the mistakes they make have grave consequences. I absolutely love that! That is a great way to use a character's flaws and mistakes! Characters in stories have to have flaws that need to be overcome and make mistakes so they can be well rounded characters! I love that!...but the only problem is, none of the characters are even remotely likable at all. It's good to have flawed characters instead of perfect little Mary Sues, but it's another thing to actually make them into good, well rounded, likable characters, with redeemable flaws and imperfections. The characters are basically the movie's biggest dark spot.Now to get these out of the way: the music and animation are beautiful. Jaw-droppingly gorgeous, the animation is legendary for it's time. There's a ton of detail put into everything, like characters preparing for a battle to simple character movement, and the animators go way out of their way to make the people from Itha and Paro different from each other. I also really love the way they animate explosions and flying ships, especially the scene were Izu plays around with a flying machine for the first time. The music is also very wonderful, with some Yoko Kanno-esque orchestral tracks, even though I did find some pieces that I felt were a bit too peppy and bouncy for certain scenes. Also some things I didn't like were the evil king and a random nipple shot early on (I really need to stop being so sensitive about these things). It's definitely not a perfect movie, and it could have been better if it made it's characters more than just a bunch of one dimensional stereotypes, but I can see how this movie made an impact on the early otaku community when anime was just barely making a blip in the US. It's well animated, it's grim, it doesn't have a happy ending, and it's characters are so annoyingly but wonderfully flawed.I don't hate the movie. I acknowledge everything it does right, and GOD, some things it does right are absolutely wonderful!

To be specific, it was the original Japanese version, subtitled by the ""Live-eviL"" fan-sub group.Well, let\'s start with the art. For a film from 1986, it looks VERY nice. The animation is smooth, varied, and has a lot of nice, subtle touches. It still looks dated by today\'s standards, but is still pretty easy to appreciate. The world is also pretty beautifully realized, with some gorgeous looking background art. The character art is all pretty standard for the era, but the quality of the animation makes them stand out more than they otherwise would.As for the story, this is...where it really falls apart for me. The movie starts off fine, and the characters start to develop. You start to get a feel for the world, and the story arc, and despite it being paced somewhat slowly, it still seemed pretty well put together. However, about halfway through the story, things change. Characters that were developed early-on start arbitrarily changing their motivations left and right, seemingly for no reason. Yet, other characters feel lifeless, like an empty shell, with no real depth to them whatsoever. This makes it difficult to like any of the characters, and as such, the story ends up falling flat, since it\'s very focused on them.The pacing also seemed to get slower and slower as the film went on. There\'s a lot of filler shots, and it made me feel like I was just waiting for the next thing to happen. However, even when that next thing happened, I wasn\'t satisfied with it, because it usually involved one of the characters, who are all so completely unlikable that anything that happened involving them didn\'t matter to me. The film entirely failed to be captivating, and by the last 30 minutes, I was kind of just waiting for it to be over. Then it ended, and I still didn\'t feel satisfied. I felt like the ending was supposed to make me cry, but it didn\'t, because I wasn\'t emotionally invested in any of the characters. After all was said and done, I kind of just felt like I wasted my time.Yet, despite all that, I still find the movie oddly charming. I don\'t think it\'s good by any stretch, but it has a few decent moments in the beginning and middle of it. Also, the animation probably would have really wowed me 10 or 15 years ago, and it\'s still good today, but it\'s not good enough to push everything else to the side and focus solely on that. However, that seems like exactly what this movie tries to do. It substitutes well-formed characters and a well-paced story arc for some visual flair. It ultimately ends up being far less than what it could have otherwise been, if a little extra care went into the story and the characters. where it really falls apart for me.

This movie seems to have been riding the wave of industry optimism about high budget and highly artistic anime films, following the success of ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" and ""Macross: Do You Remember Love?"" in 1984. Likewise, many of scenes involving hover vehicles reminds one of the masterful scene flow that one can find in the action sequences in the 1984 OVA ""Birth"": as we are shown rapidly morphing background shots around detailed vehicle motion from different perspectives – making even a...simple ride through a forest seem exciting. That’s right, I said hover vehicles. This is not so much a sword and sorcery styled fantasy as it is something that resembles steampunk in some ways, but is probably best left not being labeled.""Windaria"" has a simple and effective story with a very clear and unambiguous sense of morality and narrative direction, which (for me at least) gives off a kind of healthy naivety, being viewed now in an age where moral ambiguity has become almost more standard and safe in film than utilizing more traditional notions of moral dualism, and excessive plot twists are used to cover up a lack of interesting ideas.The shot composition and audio-visual directing is masterful. There is allot of animation – and every scene uses its masterful sense of motion to convey just the right emotion for it. Every movement is powerfully expressive and well conceived. The music choices are always appropriate and add on a lot to the scenes. Heavy exposition is not needed to explain what the emotions of the characters in a scene are – almost everything is laid bare through the audio-visual presentation, and just about every scene in this movie becomes supremely memorable and even sublime due to this.The beginning of the movie gives us a long gorgeous scenic overview of the world, and it feels very much alive right off the bat. The color palette is lively, playful, and soft in these opening scenes, and the beginning of the movie presents us with a naive and joyful world, one that sadly is about to be torn apart due to unchecked ambition and jealousy. As we are introduced to the antagonists it is made entirely clear, via their homeland’s color palette, their uniforms, their mannerisms, and the bleak city they inhabit – exactly who these people are. Where our protagonists live in a lush and lively world full of water and plant life, our antagonists live in a wretched lifeless mountain range, surrounded by industrial excess, squalor, and degeneracy. Where our protagonists act with a naive joy and a love of the simple pleasures of life, our antagonists live in a world of drunken antagonism, grey poverty, and brutal folly, as they operate their industrial weapons poorly and constantly cause disaster for themselves with their incompetence, merely to brush it off as if it was a matter of course. These people feel tired and jaded – their grey world has sucked them up and left them numb. Industrialism goes hand in hand with degradation. This film makes these points with very little dialogue. The antagonist’s side doesn\'t receive much moral condemnation from characters – we get to see exactly what is wrong with them without much commentary. It is a great example of world building that follows the maxim ""show don’t tell"".The character designs are very pleasing to me, though every now and again a shot of a character will come off as slightly lacking in dynamism in comparison to how dynamic the world is, a bit more shading on the characters in some shots could be helpful. Still this hits a very nice spot between total realism and cartoonish abstraction, focusing on excellent bodily anatomic detail mixed with larger eyes and a more abstract facial style, that works well for fantastical settings. The character designs remind me of ""Genmu Senki Leda"" from a year earlier. If you like character designs that exemplify the archetype of 80s proto-Moe then these will probably hit the spot for you.This movie could have benefited from a slightly longer run time. Our characters develop in a sensible way, but it does feel like the development happens too abruptly at times, as if we missed a few scenes that showed the route they took to get from point A to point B. Likewise, certain thematic elements that were explored at the end could have been tackled with a bit more clarity.Likewise, the film has two major character arcs/plot lines. Either cutting one of them out, or having more run time to explore both of them in more depth would have been a bit more effective. We could have gotten a stronger sense of who these characters are this way as well. But these are very minor problems considering that the goals of the film are far more oriented around immersive world building and aesthetic emotional power than the story or the character’s personalities.If you like fantasy, high budget anime films with an impressive degree of audio-visual mastery, a highly effective “show don’t tell” delivery, hyper-kinematic action sequences ( and hyper-kinematic romance and drama sequences at that) and genuinely immersive and sublime world building – then ""Windaria"" is absolutely for you. If you are coming off of a ""Nausicaa"" high and want something slightly derivative, but not too much so, then this may be up your alley. The girls are pretty great too, if floofy haired 80s anime babes are your thing, that is. simple ride through a forest seem exciting. That’s right, I said hover vehicles. This is not so much a sword and sorcery styled fantasy as it is something that resembles steampunk in some ways, but is probably best left not being labeled.""Windaria"" has a simple and effective story with a very clear and unambiguous sense of morality and narrative direction, which (for me at least) gives off a kind of healthy naivety, being viewed now in an age where moral ambiguity has become almost more standard and safe in film than utilizing more traditional notions of moral dualism, and excessive plot twists are used to cover up a lack of interesting ideas.The shot composition and audio-visual directing is masterful. There is allot of animation – and every scene uses its masterful sense of motion to convey just the right emotion for it. Every movement is powerfully expressive and well conceived. The music choices are always appropriate and add on a lot to the scenes. Heavy exposition is not needed to explain what the emotions of the characters in a scene are – almost everything is laid bare through the audio-visual presentation, and just about every scene in this movie becomes supremely memorable and even sublime due to this.The beginning of the movie gives us a long gorgeous scenic overview of the world, and it feels very much alive right off the bat. The color palette is lively, playful, and soft in these opening scenes, and the beginning of the movie presents us with a naive and joyful world, one that sadly is about to be torn apart due to unchecked ambition and jealousy. As we are introduced to the antagonists it is made entirely clear, via their homeland’s color palette, their uniforms, their mannerisms, and the bleak city they inhabit – exactly who these people are. Where our protagonists live in a lush and lively world full of water and plant life, our antagonists live in a wretched lifeless mountain range, surrounded by industrial excess, squalor, and degeneracy. Where our protagonists act with a naive joy and a love of the simple pleasures of life, our antagonists live in a world of drunken antagonism, grey poverty, and brutal folly, as they operate their industrial weapons poorly and constantly cause disaster for themselves with their incompetence, merely to brush it off as if it was a matter of course. These people feel tired and jaded – their grey world has sucked them up and left them numb. Industrialism goes hand in hand with degradation. This film makes these points with very little dialogue. The antagonist’s side doesn\'t receive much moral condemnation from characters – we get to see exactly what is wrong with them without much commentary. It is a great example of world building that follows the maxim ""show don’t tell"".The character designs are very pleasing to me, though every now and again a shot of a character will come off as slightly lacking in dynamism in comparison to how dynamic the world is, a bit more shading on the characters in some shots could be helpful. Still this hits a very nice spot between total realism and cartoonish abstraction, focusing on excellent bodily anatomic detail mixed with larger eyes and a more abstract facial style, that works well for fantastical settings.

It felt like you were tripping out heavily watching that show. This one just doesn't give me that at all.

Coppelion,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9479/Coppelion,"[""Coppelion is what I would describe as a beautiful anime gone straight to hell. I’m not referring to the artwork here because that’s glamorous. What originally started out as an alluring premise with promise turned into an abomination that becomes almost intolerable to watch thanks to its style and overall portrayal of the post-apocalyptic genre. This anime itself is an apocalyptic failure that illustrates just how not to adapt its manga. Not that the manga is any better but Coppelion comes to me as a show that should of never been resurrected.The series itself is based off of the manga of the same name written...by Tomonori Inoue. The term “Coppelion” refers to an unit of trained specialists with special abilities that tries to find survivors after a faithful event that happened in the year of 2016. Apparently, the city of Tokyo becomes a contamination like war zone as its people are faced to deal with a grim reality; that reality being the brisk on extinction as the a nearby nuclear plant undergoes meltdown. So now, it’s up to the Coppelion special task force to find survivors 20 years later. This definitely sets up a decent science fiction theme series with its beautiful visuals that truly illustrates the aftermath of the tragedy as well as its story. However, that story turned out to be a tragic breakdown.The series has three main characters named Ibara Naruse, Aoi Fukasaku, and Taeko Nomura. These three girls seems to be humanity’s last hope. But what makes its setup odd is how these young girls are able to give hope to the people. That answer is simple: they all have immunity to the radiation that contaminated Tokyo. In fact, the girls are genetically engineered to be capable of surviving in such a harsh environment. But taking the word ‘capable’ to describe these girls is an overstatement here. While the trio is able to deal most of their assigned tasks, the majority of the responsibility falls into the hands of Ibara Naruse. She is portrayed as a natural leader with her confidence and her determination to help the people. Of course, she also possesses strength, agility, and intellect to carry out her tasks. Now the other question is: what about Aoi and Taeko? They also have a purpose right? In most cases, I would regrettably say no. Throughout the series, Aoi and Taeko plays the role of more like sidekicks. Taeko at one point even puts the team into jeopardy for her careless actions. What’s even worse though is Aoi, a character that is about as useful as a palm tree in the desert. She has literally no skills and often stands in the way. Her obnoxious and childish behavior also hinders the team as well as putting others during an assigned task at risk. During many instances, she seems to be scared for her own life despite trying to save others; how ironic. It seems like other needs to save her and turns out she’s probably even more human than the survivors.The story itself originally sets itself well. There’s the apocalyptic background clearly illustrated by its landscape of desolation. It composes itself both inside and outside with the ruined cities and lack of civilization. The only people our main characters seemingly encounter are survivors in the beginning. These survivors obviously do not possess the same ability as Coppelion. Instead, they depend on them in order to make it out of Tokyo alive, or die trying. As for the story itself though, this show tries hard but doesn’t land anywhere. The first episode establishes the fact that there are survivors out there but at the same time, there is also danger. Even when they do find survivors, it's usually shown that they are at the edge of their lives. This is presented in many circumstances as this show tries to draw out an image to viewers’ minds - a world in which anyone can die. At many cases, the girls are able to save the survivors but this usually falls under Ibara’s shoulders.  AGAIN, what a shocker. Almost every episode involves Ibara pulling out superhuman movements while drawing her handy pistol. Meanwhile, our other two girls sits on standby or providing little support. When Ibara succeeds, the girls plays the role of the cheerleaders. As for the survivors themselves, most of them seemingly only play a very minor role that falls under a weekly basis, to almost never seen or heard again. Some of these survivors also doesn’t seem to want to live for certain reasons as well. Later on though, the series does shift more into a progressing plot gear mode as the girls learns more about the world they are in as well as its past. Additionally, more dangerous antagonists are introduced who even has a past with the Coppelions or main characters themselves. There is also one other main supporting character named Haruto that gets introduced mid way into the series but his characterization is no better than the rest; as if they had any at all in the first place.There are also some absurd standards that makes this show question viewers what they may be watching. The girls is one example as we see they don’t stand out as anything special. They are designed like high school girls that shows hardly any menacing features. Their designs matches those of a high school student with they way they are dressed. More awkward is the fact that they are dressed in little protective gear. Instead, they wear skirts so noticeably short that surprisingly can hide what’s underneath the whole time. The series’ mechanics also has holes that doesn’t seem to add up such as the way certain military vehicles are operated or genetic engineering revolving several Coppelions. Then, there’s some of the antagonists the girls faces throughout the series. The Coppelion special force are just composed of a three unit team but most of the time are capable of taking down a military group. Even when they do get a little support from others, their task is achieved through some form of Deus Ex machina. What makes it worse though is the fact that the survivors seemingly doesn’t want how the results of a mission turns out to be. In most cases, this means their lives are saved despite a desire to pass on to the next world. The show also makes the antagonists seem weak as in almost fictional story of face and heels. In the end, the heroes usually triumphs out of some sort of odd circumstance.The artwork of this series can be described as ‘scenery porn’. Most of the landscape and backgrounds are majestically illustrated giving it a cutting edge magnificence. The desolate lands of  Tokyo truly does look like something of an aftermath from an apocalyptic event. The lack of civilization as well the destruction of its structures are further evidence of this. The production studio Gohands (known more recently for its works including K and Mardock Scramble) can draw some similarity with its background designs. Furthermore, the lack of fan service eliminates distractions that sets upon a more serious mood for this series. It also incorporates the usage of effective camera angles combined with gusts of wind to illustrate that empty settling atmosphere of the apocalyptic Tokyo as in 2036. Unfortunately, there is some odd artwork involving how the characters appear on screen on various occasions through a technique of thick line style and palate. The purpose of this seems to be unknown but from my guess is probably to focus on the characters as its prominent feature rather than its breathtaking backgrounds.Soundtrack wise, Coppelion is decent enough to live up to its expectations. Action scenes and cliffhangers are demonstrated with heart beating tones. There’s minimal comedy or fan service so most of the time, the show itself omits the usage of comedic OST but replaces them with a more solemn theme. The OP song “Angel” by angela (K, Valvrave the Liberator, Heroic Age) is catchy for its scientific-like tone of presentation. The ED song sung by her also gives off both a scientific mood with its tragedy-like style. Ibara’s VA (Haruka Tomatsu) gives off a confidence tone of voice while Aoi is a clear example of a girl in distress. Aoi represents the weakness of the team as well as the most human so her voice is often portrayed as helpless girl seeking for help despite wanting to help others.Honestly, Coppelion is a show that I tried to desperately take a liking to but its construction of the story just doesn’t swing in the right way. The premise sets up itself well and is convincing enough especially for those into science fiction or fans of post tragic series. Past series like Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Shinsekai Yori, and Casshern Sins also demonstrated similar themes but had more character driven plots. However, Coppelion lacks most of that and instead puts its faith into saving survivors. The artwork did save the show quite a bit though but the story and overall execution is just tragic. I don’t mean tragic in a tear-jerking way but rather as an deterioration of a potential success. This show did not achieve success for me in any way. Instead, it was a bloody revolution. by Tomonori Inoue. The term “Coppelion” refers to an unit of trained specialists with special abilities that tries to find survivors after a faithful event that happened in the year of 2016. Apparently, the city of Tokyo becomes a contamination like war zone as its people are faced to deal with a grim reality; that reality being the brisk on extinction as the a nearby nuclear plant undergoes meltdown. So now, it’s up to the Coppelion special task force to find survivors 20 years later. This definitely sets up a decent science fiction theme series with its beautiful visuals that truly illustrates the aftermath of the tragedy as well as its story. However, that story turned out to be a tragic breakdown.The series has three main characters named Ibara Naruse, Aoi Fukasaku, and Taeko Nomura. These three girls seems to be humanity’s last hope. But what makes its setup odd is how these young girls are able to give hope to the people. That answer is simple: they all have immunity to the radiation that contaminated Tokyo. In fact, the girls are genetically engineered to be capable of surviving in such a harsh environment. But taking the word ‘capable’ to describe these girls is an overstatement here. While the trio is able to deal most of their assigned tasks, the majority of the responsibility falls into the hands of Ibara Naruse. She is portrayed as a natural leader with her confidence and her determination to help the people. Of course, she also possesses strength, agility, and intellect to carry out her tasks. Now the other question is: what about Aoi and Taeko? They also have a purpose right? In most cases, I would regrettably say no. Throughout the series, Aoi and Taeko plays the role of more like sidekicks. Taeko at one point even puts the team into jeopardy for her careless actions. What’s even worse though is Aoi, a character that is about as useful as a palm tree in the desert. She has literally no skills and often stands in the way. Her obnoxious and childish behavior also hinders the team as well as putting others during an assigned task at risk. During many instances, she seems to be scared for her own life despite trying to save others; how ironic. It seems like other needs to save her and turns out she’s probably even more human than the survivors.The story itself originally sets itself well. There’s the apocalyptic background clearly illustrated by its landscape of desolation. It composes itself both inside and outside with the ruined cities and lack of civilization. The only people our main characters seemingly encounter are survivors in the beginning. These survivors obviously do not possess the same ability as Coppelion. Instead, they depend on them in order to make it out of Tokyo alive, or die trying. As for the story itself though, this show tries hard but doesn’t land anywhere. The first episode establishes the fact that there are survivors out there but at the same time, there is also danger. Even when they do find survivors, it's usually shown that they are at the edge of their lives. This is presented in many circumstances as this show tries to draw out an image to viewers’ minds - a world in which anyone can die. At many cases, the girls are able to save the survivors but this usually falls under Ibara’s shoulders.  AGAIN, what a shocker. Almost every episode involves Ibara pulling out superhuman movements while drawing her handy pistol. Meanwhile, our other two girls sits on standby or providing little support. When Ibara succeeds, the girls plays the role of the cheerleaders. As for the survivors themselves, most of them seemingly only play a very minor role that falls under a weekly basis, to almost never seen or heard again. Some of these survivors also doesn’t seem to want to live for certain reasons as well. Later on though, the series does shift more into a progressing plot gear mode as the girls learns more about the world they are in as well as its past. Additionally, more dangerous antagonists are introduced who even has a past with the Coppelions or main characters themselves. There is also one other main supporting character named Haruto that gets introduced mid way into the series but his characterization is no better than the rest; as if they had any at all in the first place.There are also some absurd standards that makes this show question viewers what they may be watching. The girls is one example as we see they don’t stand out as anything special. They are designed like high school girls that shows hardly any menacing features. Their designs matches those of a high school student with they way they are dressed. More awkward is the fact that they are dressed in little protective gear. Instead, they wear skirts so noticeably short that surprisingly can hide what’s underneath the whole time. The series’ mechanics also has holes that doesn’t seem to add up such as the way certain military vehicles are operated or genetic engineering revolving several Coppelions. Then, there’s some of the antagonists the girls faces throughout the series. The Coppelion special force are just composed of a three unit team but most of the time are capable of taking down a military group. Even when they do get a little support from others, their task is achieved through some form of Deus Ex machina. What makes it worse though is the fact that the survivors seemingly doesn’t want how the results of a mission turns out to be. In most cases, this means their lives are saved despite a desire to pass on to the next world. The show also makes the antagonists seem weak as in almost fictional story of face and heels. In the end, the heroes usually triumphs out of some sort of odd circumstance.The artwork of this series can be described as ‘scenery porn’. Most of the landscape and backgrounds are majestically illustrated giving it a cutting edge magnificence. The desolate lands of  Tokyo truly does look like something of an aftermath from an apocalyptic event. The lack of civilization as well the destruction of its structures are further evidence of this. The production studio Gohands (known more recently for its works including K and Mardock Scramble) can draw some similarity with its background designs. Furthermore, the lack of fan service eliminates distractions that sets upon a more serious mood for this series. It also incorporates the usage of effective camera angles combined with gusts of wind to illustrate that empty settling atmosphere of the apocalyptic Tokyo as in 2036. Unfortunately, there is some odd artwork involving how the characters appear on screen on various occasions through a technique of thick line style and palate. The purpose of this seems to be unknown but from my guess is probably to focus on the characters as its prominent feature rather than its breathtaking backgrounds.Soundtrack wise, Coppelion is decent enough to live up to its expectations. Action scenes and cliffhangers are demonstrated with heart beating tones. There’s minimal comedy or fan service so most of the time, the show itself omits the usage of comedic OST but replaces them with a more solemn theme. The OP song “Angel” by angela (K, Valvrave the Liberator, Heroic Age) is catchy for its scientific-like tone of presentation. The ED song sung by her also gives off both a scientific mood with its tragedy-like style. Ibara’s VA (Haruka Tomatsu) gives off a confidence tone of voice while Aoi is a clear example of a girl in distress. Aoi represents the weakness of the team as well as the most human so her voice is often portrayed as helpless girl seeking for help despite wanting to help others.Honestly, Coppelion is a show that I tried to desperately take a liking to but its construction of the story just doesn’t swing in the right way. The premise sets up itself well and is convincing enough especially for those into science fiction or fans of post tragic series. Past series like Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Shinsekai Yori, and Casshern Sins also demonstrated similar themes but had more character driven plots.

These people are of course saints, and we get to see missions where our three radiation immune saints save people from radiation while crying. By three radiation immune saints saving people, I mean our main girl, Ibarawhatever, saving people while the other two watch. Alternatively watch and cry.The character are pretty useless and stupid and for some reason there is three of them instead of one....There was a seemingly interesting settings; normal people getting saved by radiation immune people. The catch being that normal people don\'t think these immune people as people at all. People see them as dolls, basically. However, their actions on saving normal people would change normal people\'s views about radiation immune people == change for character development. Unfortunately situations like these get turned back to zero by our main girl who simply replies "" I don\'t understand such complicated things."" Then we move to an another scene about crying. Followed by the next mission. Leaving me wonder why the fuck. It\'s not deep, there is no message. She just literally says that I\'m too fucking stupid to follow what you are saying about me being like human and I also have to cry since I haven\'t for a while.This really could have been an interesting series if there was other things going on, the characters had some sort of brain function and there was a reason for all of this. A plot, some motives, a tiny bit of depth of some sort, but instead of this the creators decided to take a way which should be referred as ""I have a emotion thingy."" This is seriously more like some project which is still on the beta stage, only way to make it sell is to add 5 radiation immune and 5 normal bishies to the series and call it a reverse harem.

So very few manage to do the genre justice with how vast the genre generally has to go for it, and most writers don’t have the most competence to write out a competent narrative. Whether or not they are about a nuclear holocaust, zombie invasion, ecological disaster, divine judgment, or pandemic reasons, there are so many possibilities for story writers to come up with brilliant ideas for the genre with some great results and ones that are not so great.  Our little anime Coppelion falls into this category that fails...to provide a meaningful narrative and a dull melodramatic story that severely cripples it from being an intricate show during Japan’s nuclear fallout disaster into one that completely mocks it.Most people are in unanimous agreement that the artwork is pretty spectacular. To which it is, backgrounds really do look fantastic and fit pretty well to the tone of the post-apocalyptic setting with the dense watercolor backdrop on the dead grass that inhabits the concrete buildings and roads. However, with that said, there’s still a problem with the consistency of the character art designs to the world’s art design. When you look at the characters, they look like they belong in your typical high-school anime with their sleek, clean looks and schoolgirl outfits. If they were to be taken seriously as consistent designs, I’d imagine them not being the glamorous, pretty girls they are if they lived in this environment for so long. Not only does it not fit very well in a post-apocalyptic setting because of its distracting nature, but it also doesn’t fit well with the show's tone. It would be like watching a movie set in the Middle Ages during the Black Plague era, and everyone else looked like they were. Animation does fair more than the consistent artwork, but these awful CGI techniques are used constantly throughout the vehicles and fight scenes.Of course, this straightforward construction of the enormous points of the show’s problems is the writing. Following a 1st personal narrative from the eyes of the three girls, the show follows several plot arcs where we meet certain groups of people trying to survive out in the nuclear wasteland of Tokyo. However, if you’re expecting something that is a similar type of story to say Mushishi, you will be sorely disappointed with this. The characters we meet hardly get any deep characterization. The ones that do come across as lazy cliches that become predictable and unfortunately delve into bland melodrama that comes across as laughable than anything else.What does kill the show overall comes from the erratic pacing that goes on. From left and right, characters crop up in many places, with each episode having agendas and personal vendettas toward others. With a show that is only 13 episodes, something like this could’ve worked in a much longer season. Because of this, the pacing regularly suffers immensely in hopes of moving things forward without putting a lot of the plot points into clarification to the audience. They might have trouble with what the main plot is supposed to be besides just three girls walking through point A to point B in a post-apocalyptic setting. In one episode, they are desperate to find this granny that they’ve been building upon a lot, and then in the next episode, the granny character is not spoken of ever again, and they move on into a new mission. Almost as if these events don’t feel connected whatsoever very well that cripples the world-building as a whole. When it finally does get to that specific point where you do see where the plot is trying to go, it doesn’t go anywhere. You almost can’t feel any emotional impact from the constant cliffhangers because there’s little development to the story and characters.Very few characters make a considerable impression apart from the main characters, but they suffer bland stereotypical fates. Only Ibara Naruse seems to have a brain in her head, while the rest seem only to have screaming and whining as their only two reactions and become more like cheerleaders for Naruse most of the time. They even sometimes screw up certain things that almost jeopardize their whole operation, which begs how they even got the job of being these operatives in the first place. If anything, they come across as mere mindless pawns that don’t offer anything other than pure annoying schoolgirl service that isn’t charming or funny because of their out-of-place nature.There are logical inconsistencies that can’t be taken with a grain of salt in some action scenes, such as breaking the laws of physics. In some action shows, viewers can ignore these problems because of their outlandish nature of defying physics just for convenience. Still, Coppelion is portraying itself as a realistic setting. You can’t just toss out these laws to see pretty action sequences because it will go against odds with the show’s naturalistic atmosphere,e and we won’t be able to take it seriously as we did in the beginning. Examples include: 1) People can survive a rocket launcher’s backblast from inside a building. 2) Someone can survive an anesthetic bullet from close range even though a bullet can still kill someone. 3) How can someone survive from a shell exploding next to them even at medium long-range? None of which are given any context whatsoever due to the hack directing.The antagonists they face don’t come across as anything memorable with all of that aside. Not even the Ozu sisters, with their very eccentric personalities. The main antagonists’ reasons for trying to take over Coppelion aren’t given enough context, so we don’t even get enough out of them whether we are supposed to be sympathetic or hate them for their reasoning for doing the things they do. In reality, they don’t have much reason to respond other than that they are just evil people because they’re just cruel and whatever reasons the show had written for them felt muddled and contrived. Their archetypes are the typical big lousy government organization that wants to rule over the landscape to gain control over Tokyo, just like every other story like it.I never thought I would say this, but Aoi would be the first character in an anime that Kana Hanazawa that I constantly couldn’t stand at all just from her voice alone. Usually, Hanazawa can pull off a good performance, even when her characters aren’t exactly likable. But with her character Aoi, there’s absolutely no positive outcome from the fact that the only tone of her voice that she seems to put into Aoi is high-pitched whining. The other cast members don’t stand out either, but they are listenable, unlike poor little Hanazawa. For the music aspect, for what few stand-out songs there are for the show itself, the opening and ending themes are okay songs that fit somewhat to Coppelion’s setting with lovely dark guitar tones in the OP by the band Angela.Calling Coppelion an abject failure would be taking it lightly. It could’ve been a solid show to be experienced if there wasn’t the atrocious pacing, poorly developed characters, and horrible melodrama underneath it all, but we could’ve only hoped that it would be entertaining from a funny standpoint once it stops being funny and steps into a mind-numbing boring anime, the entertainment stops and the dull mediocrity sets in. I’d rather watch a show be entertainingly bad than be boring, and this managed to do both. To this, I must now let Coppelion sit on the throne as one of the most disappointing failures of the year, if there was ever a throne in the first place.Grade: D to provide a meaningful narrative and a dull melodramatic story that severely cripples it from being an intricate show during Japan’s nuclear fallout disaster into one that completely mocks it.Most people are in unanimous agreement that the artwork is pretty spectacular.

To this, I must now let Coppelion sit on the throne as one of the most disappointing failures of the year, if there was ever a throne in the first place.Grade: D"", 'Coppelion can be summed up as disappointing.This is because it has an alluring premise: a derelict city scarred by nuclear disaster, overrun by wilderness with a few human survivors scattered about. There\'s plenty interesting about a setting like this, and Go Hands does such a great job on the scenery porn that I am currently using a rotating cycle of background shots from the show as my wallpaper.Unfortunately the characters who populate that setting are not interesting, nor is anything they do. The writing for this show is crap, plain and simple. Setting aside the issue of the Coppelion being teenage girls (standard anime...conceit), the whole Coppelion project seems half-assed and directionless with no clear goals despite the apparently huge amount of time and money spent on developing these super humans. Ibara\'s unit stumbles blindly from one rescue to the next with no plan besides wandering the ruins of Tokyo with a magic Geiger counter that mysteriously led them to humans or sometimes to animals, as the plot required. Virtually every ""mission"" they acquire is something cobbled together at the moment, a response to some random survivor\'s plight. But I\'ve watched shows with worse plots (or no real plot at all) and enjoyed them. What keeps that from happening here is a dearth of likable characters.Let me start out by saying I liked the Coppelion girls at first. I liked Ibara\'s tough compassion and Aoi was adorable. Taeko didn\'t stand out much, but that ended up helping my opinion of her in the long run, since I came to greatly dislike both Ibara and Aoi by the end of the series. I found Ibara\'s compassion to be a very sympathetic trait in the beginning, when it was directed toward the truly pitiable and desperate, but it became grating as the series wore on and she indiscriminately bestowed compassion on even the most psychotic people she encountered. It just didn\'t sit right with me, it made her seem naive and a supremely bad judge of character. She is not a pacifist, she can\'t pull off the Jesus thing, so her compassion seems arbitrary and forced when it comes to sparing the lives of homicidal lunatics. Aoi is less a hypocrite and more useless baggage. Her shining moment of the series is running away from people who bullied her in school. I wish I was exaggerating here, but I\'m not. To be sure the show tries to dress it up as something heroic, but Aoi is a hysterical coward to the very end. Taeko at the least shows some grit playing the mid wife, though most of it is skipped over in favor of Aoi and Ibara using non-lethal violence against homicidal lunatics.And a word about these lunatics: even these characters are not satisfying because they are none of them committed to their goals. Virtually every antagonist except for the shadowy foreign waste disposal companies is redeemed by episode 13, and that whole subplot about the waste dumping was forgotten halfway through the season.So nobody in this series is really interesting. They lack conviction. Not the antagonists or the protagonists. The people rescued either gratefully go along or die. I lost track of how many times a side character took off their mask dramatically and then had a tearful goodbye, I imagine their deaths were to make a point about being the only characters in the show with an ounce of conviction in their beliefs. And lord were there tears. Ibara\'s toughness is apparently only skin deep, because she cries almost every episode. She cries when a person she just met dies, she cries when a person she just met leaves the city, she cries because something vaguely sad was just told to her. Aoi is even more emotional, but on her it works and doesn\'t seem to conflict with any of her other traits. She\'s a hysterical coward, so crying over every little thing is practically her job description, it\'s honest of her.The wishy-washy, directionless writing aside, the show is technically mediocre. The one redeeming factor is the art assets, which are fantastic. The animation is mediocre and the sound is poor. The music was forgettable, the main problem I had with the sound were the effects used for various weaponry, which were jarringly bad, and I\'m nothing close to an expert on military weapons.I wouldn\'t recommend this to anybody who\'s got better things to be doing. Backlog it for a particularly boring stretch of time off if you think I\'m exaggerating. conceit), the whole Coppelion project seems half-assed and directionless with no clear goals despite the apparently huge amount of time and money spent on developing these super humans.

All is there to the anime is hearing some lame ass character whine and bitch about everything.Besides having a girl who cry throughout the whole anime, the action scenes are all replaced by a single art showing either the characters getting punched in the face or jumping.To sum it up, It's Shit. "", ""Alright so I haven't read manga so I can't compare it . But Coppelion for me had a beautiful idea. The main characters were girls which were saving people around the world. What was the problem? They weren't human. I really enjoyed watching how their characters were growing. This anime showed me beautiful power of friendship and also that it is possible to do anything if you want to. I'm not a big fan of this genre but Coppelion really made me cry. "", ""Ok, so another anime has ended, somehow I get the feeling that the writer of this anime's manga version, Tomonori Inoue seems to be a clairvoyant, though the Fukushima nuclear disaster did happen 3 years since the writer conceptualize the possibility of where the scenarios were similar, except of course in his version the nuke contamination was widespread that it covers the so called old capital, while the one that happen in Fukushima Prefecture was only limited in its area. But, anyways, I still give this anime a benefit of a doubt, surly there is something in this anime that basically annoys me, so leave...it to them Japanese to think of something possible and make a lot fancy, co'z frankly this anime has a lot of fancy in it. So I hereby present my ratings for this anime:Story- good 7.I like the plot where it involves a similar scenario of that from Fukushima Prefecture, and yes I'm referring to the nuclear plant whose one of it reactor exploded causing most of its area within the 20 km zone to be contaminated with nuclear debris, I also like the melodramatic thing that happens within the plot, but, I cannot fathom the part where there is action involve where the main task of the 3 girls have to face some adversary when they where just suppose to be in a salvage mission to look for survivors.Art- pathetic 1.Ok, the background, that I have no comment, but them Coppelions in school uniform out in a salvage mission??????AH! It is as worse as going to a formal gathering in a bikini, wtf was this writer, Tomonori Inoue thinking?!Geeez, they're in a salvage mission, at least  writer Tomonori Inoue-san  could have at least made them wore fatigues uniforms, and if he wants to maintain that moe thing, he could have them girls wore cargo short shorts, with matching long socks and hiking boots, in fact I'm thinking of the same attire that Lara Croft of Tomb Raider would wear except with a bit of Japanese theme in it, where it would have been more appropriate for them girls. Haruto on the other hand would have looked good if he be wearing the same uniform that the JGSDF would, also there is the HAZMAT suits, where it kinda looks more like a space suit than a Hazmat, which was a clear indication that when the illustrator did such illustration he probably didn't do his research well, and let's not forget the Division 1 people, who dresses like they are members of the NAZI. I hate to say it but the character's attires are just too way fancy. What's even more bad was that I don't get to see any panty shot or some uncensored boob flashes.Sound- Decent 4.I just don't have anything to say about the seiyuu's who did the character's voices, except that I like the closing theme.Character- fair 6.I kinda like Ibara Naruse's character as this head strong leader of the trio with a heart, but I kinda have some reservations about her being too dedicated in saving lives that sometime she endangers her team.Aoi Fukasaku, was some what of a character, where at one point I like her sweetness, but I despises her indecisiveness, I also hate the fact that she can only use her powers on a limited basis.Taeko Nomura, she more like a dichotomy, where at one point she has medical training, but kinda paralyze by her hesitation to deliver Ibuki's twins.Ozu sisters- They would have been the character's I like to hate, but somehow on the last episode, they seems to be a nice duet, not bad for having a DNA taken from a psychopath.Haruto, well I like the part where he really did play out as a hero who gave his life, that is if he is still alive.Ok, so we all know that the main character's here are them Coppelions, it was nice to know the way they perform, but I just can't fathom the possibility that in this anime/manga the Japanese govt spends a lot of  money to make an artificial enhance humanoid, like a Coppelion, just as so that they can send them on a salvage mission where it would have been much cheaper to make a more effective Hazmat suit. So, despite of the performance I guess for this part should be.. fair enough.Enjoyment- good 7.What is enjoyable were the melodrama and the action, and that's this anime's silver lining which is good enough.Overall- Fair 6.Despite of the all things fancy in this anime, and the exaggerations, it was still good, but, for me the action and the melodrama wasn't enough to convince me to give this anime a score higher than 6, frankly because I really can't fathom all the fancy things and the exaggerations that this anime exhibits. it to them Japanese to think of something possible and make a lot fancy, co'z frankly this anime has a lot of fancy in it.

After an accident several decades ago caused the entire city to be filled with radiation and become unfit for human life, a project was started to create genetically enhanced humans who could survive in the toxic conditions.The story of the anime follows about a handful of arcs ranging from around one to five episodes each. The arcs all involve the protagonists meeting some stranded people they have to save them by protecting them until a...helicopter can arrive (which always seems to come as late as possible). The people who manage to survive have special hazmat suits that can keep out radiation to a certain extent, but there is always some other complication that makes saving the people more difficult.I was expecting to enjoy Coppelion when I first read about it and saw a preview video. The animation is similar to K Project (meaning that every scene contains at least four or five colors of the rainbow and everything else on the spectrum in between) except set in world that looks like it was taken out of Call of Duty. The show started off well enough but eventually collapsed in on itself as the characters failed to develop, the story became repetitive, and the animation budget apparently ran low towards the end.The main characters are three girls named Ibara, Aoi, and Taeko. Ibara is the brave leader who does all the action and keeps the other two in line. She was the class president back at their school while they were in training as Coppelion and is one of those characters that decides she has to save everyone even if they are constantly trying to kill her and everyone else. Aoi ends up being just an annoying damsel-in-distress who only does about two useful things throughout the anime as well as becoming an even less useful recluse for a while. Taeko is hardly even noticeable and performs most of her big acts of helping non-Coppelion humans off-screen. There are also a few minor characters in each arc. Most of them are humans who need rescuing (which is what the girls\' job is) as well as three other Coppelion who have most of their traits spoiled by the OP\'s animation. The villains in the show are only there for the purpose of making things more difficult for the protagonists and are very generic with poor motivations.The animation is interesting to say the least. While some scenes have way more colors than necessary, many are just astonishingly vivid and make the city filled with radiation look like you would expect (especially when there are sunsets). However, the show gets carried away with using too much blue/green in some shots even where there isn\'t any radiation and it just gets overused and honestly looks kind of gross. The action scenes later on also get very lazy. Many times you\'ll see someone start to punch and then see its conclusion with the actual action not being shown (this applies to many more things than just punches of course) as well as many shots that look like nothing more than a gif. All of the Coppelion have almost the exact same face as well as the same school uniform with some minor adjustments to them. A few of the minors characters also look similar. The soundtrack has some issues with being played a little too loud in comparison to the speaking at times, but it still manages to fit with the action at other times. Otherwise though, the soundtrack is hardly noticeable.Story -- 3/10 (I really dislike the overused ""Save the pregnant woman"" plot point)Animation -- 4/10Soundtrack -- 3/10Character -- 2/10Enjoyment -- 3/10Coppelion really had a chance to be good, but it just utterly failed in every way. The few aspects that initially seemed good disappeared as the budget disappeared. The characters which started off bad, stayed bad and Aoi just got worse. Most of the minor characters had too short of screen times for the viewer to connect with them the same way the protagonists did and in the final arc, where there was enough time, the villains were horrible and ruined any chance it had of picking itself up. The story just goes nowhere with little development in between the arcs and ends in an unsatisfying way. helicopter can arrive (which always seems to come as late as possible).

Are main characters are Ibara Naruse, Aoi Fukasaku and Taeko Nomura. These three girls are not exactly ordinary as they are artificial clones created to withstand massive doses of nuclear radiation and they possess their own special perks such as speed, super strength and even the ability to create electricity. Ibara has super strength, enhanced athletic abilities and she’s very accurate with a gun. (Though rarely uses it to harm others) Aoi… Can’t do a thing as she has no special perks or abilities and I just presumed that she was a prototype...until latter episodes. Finally we have Taeko who has heightened senses such as eyesight and hearing and has the ability to communicate with animals. The rescue unit’s job is to find any remaining survivors from the calamity that was a nuclear meltdown and get them to safety away from apocalyptic Tokyo, whilst dealing with rogue Coppelion units, dangerous civilians and disturbed military forces.This anime came out in fall 2013 and I was anticipating this anime the most along with Kill la Kill, since I am a fan of apocalyptic settings brought upon by man itself, I was hoping to get a really good and well developed story. Did Coppelion match up to my expectations? Well let’s explore this in a bit of detail.The story seems very straight forward, find and rescue all the survivors left in Tokyo, but from the first story arc in the series it doesn't seem to go all that smooth as a couple of them die sacrificing their lives for others, but it did seem very unnecessary, if they didn't panic and freak out everyone would have lived happily ever after. It did occur to me that not everyone can be saved from themselves and their inner demons. So after that start the series eventually goes on about discovering the reasons behind people staying in Tokyo because of guilt, unfinished business, fear and leaving without someone you love and seeing if they can be saved by the rescue unit.The characters in this show are somewhat mixed, we have Ibara who is the leader and role model to the other two main characters she is the authority figure in the show who wants to help and save everyone she can as Ibara feels that she has no purpose for being created if she cannot do so. Aoi is the cute, ditsy and useless girl amongst the trio. She pretty much is a spectator for the majority of the show and when times get tough she steps up and locks herself in a room as Aoi feels like she is dragging down the rest. Later on in the series she gathers enough courage to help out after some inspiring words from an android called Nosense.The final 1/3 of the group is Taeko who is the lesser focussed member of the group. Taeko is very brave and straightforward and always does whatever she can to save others around her using the methods taught to her in schoolOther mentionable characters include the Vice principle Onihei Mishima who cares about the safety of civilians left in Tokyo and even cares about the Coppelion rescue unit. We also have the only male Coppelion in the series Haruto Kurosawa who is a member of the clean up crew. Haruto is skilled with making bombs and is a good shot. At first Haruto makes his dislike of humans known to us, but he eventually learns to co-exist with others. Next we have the first of the Ozu sisters Kanon Ozu (I forgot to mention that Coppelion are clones of pre-existing humans) she is a clone of a psychotic serial killer; her power is the ability to conjure up electricity. Kanon has a deep hatred for humans (which you will discover the reasons why later on in the series) and works with other forces in order to bring about the end of humanity. Shion Ozu the second of the Ozu sisters is a very childish and sadistic girl who also carries a grudge against humanity. Her powers include super strength. She also carries the serial killer genes of her human counterpart.I couldn't find the OST anywhere so I'll go with the sound what i can remember the opening theme tune is very good and i personally didn't want to skip the intro as it is a treat for the eyes too. The ending track is also very likeable. The animation was very good, at first i was a bit surprised with the thick pencil outline on the characters but i forgot about over the course of time.What was bad about this anime was how it appeared that the producers wouldn't be afraid to kill off characters at the beginning then decided to chicken out and everyone comes out unscathed. The characters that did die seemed expendable if anything. (Granted it was only one or two characters)(This could be a spoiler so be warned) Near the end of the series there was a giant robotic spider… yeah. A rogue military leader controlled this gigantic spider machine that shot rockets and some other shit… The fight scene with said spider-bot was ridiculous and it felt like it was thrown in purely for the sake of having a giant spider-bot. I can’t even begin to imagine how much time and money would go into making that thing, and for what reason or cause.The dialogue could have been better in some places such as Ibara’s hard to watch pleads to those trying to cause trouble or to the civilians that refused to leave Tokyo.I'd also like to give a shout out to the android Nosense who teaches us that regardless of whether or not he is human that he has feelings and emotions.Overall Coppelion was a bit of a disappointment. I did like the show but after watching the first three episodes I was disappointed with how the rest of the series turned out. Characters can be hit or miss at times like Aoi who can be adorable but also very idiotic and insufferable, Ibara who is brave and courageous but when she went to the ground and pleaded with tears pouring from her eyes it was very pitiful. The story can be very absurd at times but I enjoyed this enough to continue to the end. Although I did enjoy the series I would not personally recommend this, I’d say give the first few episodes a try at least. until latter episodes.

Then, as the series went on, on CrunchyRoll there were a lot of people who thought this was one the most disappointing anime they've ever seen, and how it's pretty darn bad. Note: I have never read the original manga material, so I do not know how the anime compares to that, so I'll be reviewing the anime on its own.Well, I disagree. First, let's talk about the goods.1) The artwork and style is truly fantastic. The characters pop, details are easily visualized on screen, and it has that...grey-ish filter that makes everything look post-apocalyptic. When we get to a change of green scenery, the viewer can definitely see a drastic difference between what's been damaged by the nuclear incident and what nature has done to repair itself.2) I really enjoy the OP and ED by Angela. The voice actors and actresses all do a pretty good job portraying their respective characters too.3) The pacing is pretty good. Each episode always ends in excitement, so at least for me, I was excited to next week's episode.4) Story is acceptable for what's going on. I don't think the anime is portraying itself as being a very realistic and serious series, so the occasional gags and jokes aren't out of place in my opinion. Others however, thought the opposite. Some think there's too many illogical instances that go in stark contrast to what the anime is trying to portray.What I didn't like1) Characters don't really develop throughout the series. Nearly everybody is one-dimensional (at least until the climax), and some viewers may find Aoi really annoying. But, I think she was funny and cute. On the contrast, if people have seen Anohana, I thought Menma was much more annoying than Aoi.2) As a result of the characters not really developing, the viewer doesn't really connect emotionally to the characters, especially when things, both good or bad, happen to them.3) Story could have been done better with a tighter script, but this is a minor fault.So overall, I enjoyed this anime. Therefore I'd give it a 7/10. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but I enjoyed it through and through, and would definitely watch season 2 if that were to ever come out. grey-ish filter that makes everything look post-apocalyptic.

Too important to spoil.Art was amazing, but the fact that the characters kinda stand out in comparison to the scenery was a bit of an issue that kept catching my attention.Sound was wonderful, and the SFX was nice.Characters were nice, wish they could've elaborated more on the girl's backstories, but I'm content....Enjoyed this enough to give it a 9, don't let the other reviews discourage you.Overall, a definite 10. Enjoyed this enough to give it a 9, don't let the other reviews discourage you.Overall, a definite 10."", 'Coppelion was part of my summer anime viewing a couple years ago. Alongside BlazBlue: Alter Memory and Kill la KIll I can\'t quite recall right now, it really had potential to go places in 13 episodes. Unfortunately, it stumbled by episode 3 and crashed before episode 7. What followed were the charred remains scratching and clawing out of the wreckage that was its plot and begging to be put out of its misery. Is the manga better? Unfortunately, I couldn\'t be bothered after this botched attempt.Starting where it should be saving itself, the sound is... Meh. The only memorable part of the series was the...op despite it having a few okay tracks. You don\'t feel anything except sheer boredom when watching and the music doesn\'t alleviate this. Part of what makes an anime work is the musical score which someone in the studio behind this mistake forgot about.The characters are what you get when someone doesn\'t try. Ibara is a bad leader, the General is about as incompetent as military personnel can get, and the rest border on annoyingly stupid (Aoi comes to mind) or psychotic. Nothing about the characters redeems them and even when one sacrifices themselves, you can only feel happy that they were able to get out of this mess.The art feels rushed and incomplete, especially when some scenes have thick outlines around the girl as if the animation team said ""good enough"" and called it a day. Despite some of the visuals being pleasing in places, they\'re off-set by the thick outlines or lack of depth to the characters. Oh, but that\'s not the worst of it.Imagine if Tokyo did go up in flames during that last tsunami a few years ago. What the studio (and mangaka) attempt to create is a post-meltdown Tokyo where people in hazmat suits have somehow survived in a highly-radiated area of the country with only the apparently incompetent Japanese military dudes suffering for it. Hazmat suits are a short-term option when dealing with this kind of stuff and even then they don\'t provide 100% protection nor are they immune to degradation.None of the story makes sense, the characters are awful, the sound is forgettable, and overall it\'s a miss-able series.

Miss it.', ""Oh yes!!!!!!! This is outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (to me)This Anime gave me the feels! The OP and ED gave me the feels, and was great!I loved the art, it is so nice! I loved the story, and the characters a lot! I imagine myself in this Anime, and I was one of those made people, and I just went out and go to the contaminated place without permission hehehehehheI have no dislikes about this Anime, and still wish for a second season! There is enough material for a second season, I believe. But, I guess this didn't got much attention, which is sad.I recommend this a...lot! It's so Beautiful! lot! It's so Beautiful!"", ""Coppelion was a science fiction manga written by Inoue Tomonori from 2008 to the beginning of this year. In late 2013, before the manga had actually ended, there was an anime adaptation by GoHands. Now, I've never seen a GoHands anime before, so all I know about Coppelion is what I heard from the young lady who requested that I review it. She called it “hilariously bad.” I don't know if that's going to sum up my own feelings on it. So, let's take a look and see if it is, indeed, hilariously bad.Story:After a nuclear accident, Tokyo's been left a smouldering wreck. Twenty years...after the incident, a group of students, genetically engineered to resist radiation, are sent into the ruins to find survivors and clean the area. These students are the titular Coppelion.Let's begin by talking about the flaws with the series, and there are some major ones. First of all, the message of the series. You know how Miyazaki films tend to contain subtle, eloquent environmental messages? Well, Coppelion does the opposite. It has a loud, sanctimonious and ill-conceived message about how terrible radioactive waste build up is and we're ruining everything. While it is a message that I can get behind, in theory, the presentation here is just really inept. The series also suffers from narrative disconnect with the characters. Supposedly these girls have been trained for this all their lives but they come across as completely and grossly unprepared for the situation. Almost like they're ordinary teenage girls who were tossed into it after all of a weekend of preparation. It's also odd that these girls have superhuman abilities, but in the case of one of them they deliberately handicap those. Why would you engineer her to have super powers if you don't want her to use them? Another of our protagonists doesn't know how to use hers. You'd think that would be the number one item on the list of training necessities. Show them how to use the super powers they were designed to have. What's the point of giving them these abilities if they don't know how to use them? The back story we're given simply doesn't mesh with the action on screen. The series also suffers from its share of dumb moments. We're talking the characters thinking a bomber is a bird and an “epic” chase sequence using paddle boats shaped like swans. Incidentally, those are the only two scenes that are kind of hilarious in how stupid they are.The sad part about all this is that the premise itself does have potential. I would be really interested in a competently written series about a group of genetically engineered characters with super powers exploring a radioactive wasteland to achieve a goal. Unfortunately, we didn't get competence.Characters:I've talked about the incongruity between the back story these characters are given and what we see of them on screen. Let me talk about what we see of them specifically for a moment. Our main characters are Ibara, Aoi & Taeko. All three of them are very quick to cry and become emotionally distraught. Which is pretty annoying. So, let me get this straight, the government sent these girls into the field after training them their entire lives, but they couldn't be bothered to help them build up any mental toughness? They didn't think they'd encounter anything tragic or potentially upsetting in the radioactive wasteland? They thought it was all going to be rainbows, sunshine and the magic of friendship? Aoi isn't even aware of what her special powers are, forget about being trained in their use. Taeko has heightened senses and glasses designed to dull her super vision. There are also a couple of antagonistic coppelion with weak motivations. So weak that the ending entirely negates them. It doesn't help that the characters have no real complexity.Art:The art is one area where I'll give the series some credit. The backgrounds are really well drawn. The character designs aren't distinctive, but they look just fine. The biggest problem with the art is that the backgrounds can be really static. There are points where it looks like the characters are standing in front of a static image, albeit a really nice static image. It's like there are points where GoHands animated the characters and their actions and then put in the same background image for the entirety of the sequence.Sound:They did get some strong actresses for this. Hanazawa Kana, Tomatsu Haruka, Horie Yui & Sakamoto Maaya all have roles as major protagonists or antagonists. The trouble is that their characters really don't have much to them. The amount of time the main characters spend whining also really hurts the performances. Which results in acting that's pretty sub-par. The composer for this series was Endo Mikio and he did a decent job. It's not a particularly good soundtrack, but it's okay.Ho-yay:The three major girls cuddle up to one another in the opening theme, but there's no indication within the series proper that they have any romantic feelings towards one another.Final Thoughts:So, that was Coppelion. Is it bad? It's not one of the worst anime I've seen, but yeah. It's pretty bad. Is it hilarious? Not really. It has some scenes that are pretty funny in their stupidity. The paddle boat chase is really funny in its absurdity. The characters being too thick to tell a bomber from a bird is pretty funny. But aside from those two specific scenes, it's not really funny. It's just bad. My final rating is going to be a 3/10. Next week will be the first review of January and you know what that means. Every review is going to follow a specific theme. We've had Hayashibara Megumi, yuri, Ghibli, magical girl and sequel months. This year, it's all about girls with guns. Next week we'll kick that off with a look at Gunsmith Cats. after the incident, a group of students, genetically engineered to resist radiation, are sent into the ruins to find survivors and clean the area.

Here's my review of Coppelion as a whole series.Coppelion welcomed me with very magnificent visuals and an intriguing storyline. Albeit this, my concerns were already popping up. First, the characters seemed out of place from the entire scenery and the audio, is well, sub-par to say the most. However as the episodes go by I started to ignore these cons when the show's visual and audio department started heading the proper direction.The show's main titular characters are mostly composed of high school girls gifted with the ability of being immune...to radioactivity. Sounds cool right? But it doesn't end there; each Coppelion has their own signature ability, i.e. Ibara's superhuman reflexes and (SPOILER ALERT!) Aoi's shielding ability. However I was greatly disturbed by how emotional these female characters are and how annoying Aoi's childish personality can be. I was also skeptical about how the female characters were dressed. Their school uniform with their thin skirts are - for me - not the most ideal clothing in a rescue mission. But instead their outfits are mainly for fan-service. Even fan-service has its moments but in Coppelion, they don't seem to be a very welcoming sight.On later episodes, more and more characters are introduced, both members of the Coppelion and not-so ordinary humans. The series' plot tells on the Coppelion rescuing human settlers on the radioactive city on Tokyo, which was achieved near the show's ending and just as I was bashing the show for no direction in the storytelling. But luckily that wasn't the case until the show's mid-season episodes up to the last.Battle scenes were greatly depicted and I was impressed that the armaments used in the fray weren't so futuristic - well, except for the giant metallic spider.I was also happy about how each character gets an equal and reasonable amount of screentime. Not that you would care for each of the characters well-being but oh well...Finally, the show also greatly emphasizes on friendship and moral judgement. A very mushy topic for a genre like this but works quite well if you're fed up with the gung-ho.In conclusion Coppelion isn't an anime suited for most but it's still a watchable show. You may hate the story, the presentation, or characters (specifically, I hated Aoi the most at first), that still doesn't stop the show from airing to a specific audience. Coppelion doesn't need to try hard to become the no. 1 anime of the season but as a show that would please viewers with its own version of content. And if a second season were to air, I would gladly put that show in my watchlist. to radioactivity. Sounds cool right?

It wasn\'t that good.STORY (3):The story takes place in an abandoned city near Odaibi nuclear power plant when there was a nuclear explosion and the 3 girls who call themselves Coppelion, have their duty to evacuate the remaining survivors of the abandoned city. Coppelion is a team of students who are trained to perform different tasks and they are immune to radiation.Now, I was looking forward to the post-traumatic anime both perspectives, but sadly I was let down by the careless writing and plot holes. Also not...to mention annoying characters.I will list down all the technical problems that this anime is suffering from.Technical problem #1:B2 bomber is a Black Crow. The writers really think that B2 Bomber can fly as fast as the birds so they just make it fly together with the birds. Not to mention the B2 Bomber can be used to transport material. It appears that the writers never understand what the design of the plane ""B2 Bomber"" looked like and its functions. From our observation, we already can tell that this is a B2 Bomber plane. The writer just made it blatantly obvious for us to tell.Technical problem #2: (Possible Spoilers)In episode 2, we only see the after effects of what happened. How did the child managed to be saved? Why is the mother of the child, the only one who fell to her death?Technical problem #3:The main cast refer to the 1st Division as ""ghosts"". This means that we can never see them even though it was very obvious for us to see them.I can go on all day about the technical problems but I have to preserve my mental health.ART (4):I am fine with the design style of the anime. They used bold lines and the background is tinted in green when it is sunny.SOUND (4):I find the ending theme and opening theme all right.CHARACTER (2):How do I describe the characters? That\'s simple, just one word ""incompetent"". I really didn\'t like their attitude. All they do is cry and moan all the time and this sickens me. Let me remind you again, I hate crybabies and I have seen people in anime who really survived through hard times and yet they never cry or moan.Aoi, to me is the most annoying character in this anime. All she does is cry and moan all the time. She always makes things from bad to worse. She was the reason why I didn\'t enjoy Coppelion.Haruto was the only likable character in this anime but he was pushed aside after that.CONCLUSION (2):It seems that the writers used a lot of puns like refer the giant robot as ""Spider"" in the last few episodes. In fact, I have mentioned this in previous discussions on each particular episodes. Trying to make us unaware of what is going on, is it? You can\'t do that.Not only that, I didn\'t care about any of the characters in this anime. They were annoying.(Possible Spoilers)The ending shows that the Ozu sisters and the 3 Coppelion girls are left behind in the abandoned city while the survivors are rescued. Why can\'t they also be rescued? Why is there only one chopper? Oh, I really think that the 3 Coppelion girls are comfortable in the environment they live in. Or maybe I think that there might be other survivors?(End of possible Spoilers)I really just have nothing more to say.Overall, Coppelion could have been an entertaining series but with its inconsistencies, annoying characters and anti-climatic ending, it just killed the enjoyment for me. I\'ll give this anime a 2 out of 10. to mention annoying characters.I will list down all the technical problems that this anime is suffering from.Technical problem #1:B2 bomber is a Black Crow.

I\'ll give this anime a 2 out of 10.', 'In this post-apocalyptic nuclear melt own scenario there are bunch of special kids who are resistant to any amount of radiation. They are made to help and rescue people (anyone who is still alive) in this radiation contaminated area. How these kids feel and how they work to save people forms the story. Now the plot is not bad initially but it does not develop from there. Characters are not at all developed from the first to the last episode. It seems they have some issue with them, all these special kids i.e., Coppelions, but its never told out. Only one thing is revealed. The...main dissatisfaction is the incompleteness of the story. Even when the series finishes in the thirteenth episode you see that the story has not progressed even an inch from the first episode.Story: 3/10Art: 8/10Sound: 5/10Character: 3/10Enjoyment: 3/10Overall: 3/10 main dissatisfaction is the incompleteness of the story.

It\'s about three high school students who are genetically altered to be immune to radioactivity in Tokyo after it\'s contaminated by a nuclear accident. The Coppelion are sent in by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force to rescue the people still living in the city after a distress signal from inside Tokyo is received.The anime started off...strong with nice backgrounds, nice colors and a really nice setting... that is until we see the characters. The characters themselves don\'t mesh well with the backgrounds whatsoever. They have really thick outlines at times and don\'t seem to fit into this world. The backgrounds remind me of more vibrant and realistic styles of anime like Paprika, Children Who Chase Lost voices, or something Studio Ghibli with the detailed backgrounds, but the characters are cheaply drawn, poorly animated and are drab and almost devoid of any color due to an annoying color overlay that washes out any vibrant colors onscreen.I started the first episode and was bothered already by the thick outlined cheap looking characters that I almost stopped watching after 5 minutes. I pushed through and actually found myself getting into the story and got used to the design choices for the most part, and the characters didn\'t look too bad to me anymore. But after the first 5 or 6 episodes, the plot really slows and gets convoluted. There\'s a lot of pacing issues and it made the anime hard to watch and kind of boring at times.The last 2 episodes were really solid and I do think if the pacing throughout the entirety of the anime was more like this it would\'ve been a much more enjoyably experience. It definitely wasn\'t all bad, especially since I did have a smile on my face at the end of the 13th episode, so if you can get passed the problems, you might find this anime rather enjoyable.I do like the story, it\'s an interesting concept, and I did enjoy parts of the anime a lot, but the execution of the anime itself was so poorly done that I\'d recommend not watching it and just reading the manga, which is still going today.Which is why I have to give it a 6/10 strong with nice backgrounds, nice colors and a really nice setting... that is until we see the characters.

By the end of it, it was like seeing an attractive person and liking them until they open their mouth and start talking. In my opinion, this anime had a lot of potential to be good but a few plot holes and the characters ruined it. Dont get me wrong, while i may complain about it, im generous in the rating because certain people can watch this and enjoy it to some extent. It isnt bad if you can get over some...details and focus on the events.Plot: 6/10The plot of the story is original and good. Three genetically engineered girls go into the wasteland known as the old capital to find survivors and help them. I would find it hard to argue that this isnt somewhat interesting since it takes a different perspective of a post-apocalyptic city since its not about zombies or something like that. The downfall of the plot is that it has a few holes that may bug people. At some scenes i would pause and wonder ""did you really just \'conveniently\' find that?"" and have to take a breather to not get annoyed. There are times when things happen all too conveniently and there are also times when the plot changes for an unclear reason. For some people, possiblely anyone reading this, if you can watch something and not question what is happening then you can get past these plot holes. In my case, i just sucked it up and moved on but it still bugged me til the end. Another downfall of the plot is that it doesnt build up to many things. In a series, it is okay to go from action to drama but there is a buildup that is required for that. A person cant go from ""im going to save this little girl!"" to ""please let me do this (while crying by the way)""  without some sort of build up. Even then i dont know if the extent of the drama even called for crying in most cases but still a little buildup would have made the characters look a little bit less pathetic.Story line: 7/10When i say story line, im referring to how events play out in the series. The story line in this series isnt bad but the first few episodes may discourage you to continue. The first few arent very consistent and the characters can make you want to drop the show, ill be honest, i found myself day dreaming a bit between the 2nd and 4th. However, after these small parts the story does follow a sort of arc. While the first few episodes are a bit ""ugghh"", they are reference later on.Now, the story line as a whole is actually very good. It isnt always predictable even though some events seem like they\'ll lead a certain way. It is interesting in my opinion because it isnt on an episode by episode basis and it isnt one long arc. The events that play out do vary to a certain extents and the characters arent doing the same thing over and over again nor are they on one long journey. I found this nice and refreshing because things escalated as the story went on and this kept my attention.The characters: 5/10All i can say is ""oh my god, are you serious..."" the characters in this series are the biggest downfall i would say. The main 3 girls especially caused this series to be as bad as it was. What made them so bad, well to put it simply, they have mood swings like crazy. One minute theyre acting tough and being awesome, the next they break down and cry like they already lost the battle and watched everyone they loved die. This made me wish that someone would backhand they and tell them to get it together. The story does make it understandable to cry but i think that since the main girls were suppose to play heroes, they lost so much respect that they killed the show for people. The roles they play also makes the show unbearable to a certain extent. For example: Aoi was one of the main 3 girls yet she didnt do much for the story. I would say she was suppose to be there for comic relief but she just came off as silly and useless. Her character becomes useful eventually but even then thats not enough to gain any respect for her after the reputation she created. as a whole, i\'m guessing that she is one of the reasons people dropped the show because they were too angry and annoyed at her to continue.The side characters got to me a bit to. Yes we all understand the situation that theyre in and it can be traumatic but they dont need to cry for everything. Even the temporary characters cried and that left me shaking my head because they are too emotional for their own good. The only person I  would say held back their tears was the vice principle and he had a legit reason to cry in some incenses.Art and music: 8Im combining the art and the music in the series just because they both were very good aspects of the series and fit well together. I felt that the ending song matched the story quite well because it had a dark mood but hopeful; which is what this anime was suppose to come off as. The intro song wasn\'t bad but i felt it was a little out of place because it felt like it was for a fighting type of movie rather than one where the characters cried more than they needed to.now the art is probably one of the best aspects of the series. It is captivating in many ways and it is very detailed. The art really gives a sense of the situation the girls are in and at the same time it also can leave a person in awe just because it is detailed and it sets a nice mood.Overall: 7I gave this anime a 7 because it had a lot of potential and was great, that is if you ignore the characters\' whining, some of their motives and the fact that some things in the series were just too convenient. For anyone that decided to watch this anime, i warn you that you should be committed to starting what you finished because while the story line and art of the series may be good, the characters will make you want to drop the show. If you can go 13 episodes without questioning motives, the convenience of things or why the characters have mood swing as if they were dying then you can enjoy it. details and focus on the events.Plot: 6/10The plot of the story is original and good. Three genetically engineered girls go into the wasteland known as the old capital to find survivors and help them.

In my case, i just sucked it up and moved on but it still bugged me til the end. Another downfall of the plot is that it doesnt build up to many things. In a series, it is okay to go from action to drama but there is a buildup that is required for that. A person cant go from ""im going to save this little girl!"" to ""please let me do this (while crying by the way)""  without some sort of build up. Even then i dont know if the extent of the drama even called for crying in most cases but still a little buildup would have made the characters look a little bit less pathetic.Story line: 7/10When i say story line, im referring to how events play out in the series. The story line in this series isnt bad but the first few episodes may discourage you to continue. The first few arent very consistent and the characters can make you want to drop the show, ill be honest, i found myself day dreaming a bit between the 2nd and 4th. However, after these small parts the story does follow a sort of arc. While the first few episodes are a bit ""ugghh"", they are reference later on.Now, the story line as a whole is actually very good. It isnt always predictable even though some events seem like they\'ll lead a certain way. It is interesting in my opinion because it isnt on an episode by episode basis and it isnt one long arc. The events that play out do vary to a certain extents and the characters arent doing the same thing over and over again nor are they on one long journey. I found this nice and refreshing because things escalated as the story went on and this kept my attention.The characters: 5/10All i can say is ""oh my god, are you serious..."" the characters in this series are the biggest downfall i would say. The main 3 girls especially caused this series to be as bad as it was. What made them so bad, well to put it simply, they have mood swings like crazy. One minute theyre acting tough and being awesome, the next they break down and cry like they already lost the battle and watched everyone they loved die. This made me wish that someone would backhand they and tell them to get it together. The story does make it understandable to cry but i think that since the main girls were suppose to play heroes, they lost so much respect that they killed the show for people. The roles they play also makes the show unbearable to a certain extent. For example: Aoi was one of the main 3 girls yet she didnt do much for the story. I would say she was suppose to be there for comic relief but she just came off as silly and useless. Her character becomes useful eventually but even then thats not enough to gain any respect for her after the reputation she created. as a whole, i\'m guessing that she is one of the reasons people dropped the show because they were too angry and annoyed at her to continue.The side characters got to me a bit to. Yes we all understand the situation that theyre in and it can be traumatic but they dont need to cry for everything. Even the temporary characters cried and that left me shaking my head because they are too emotional for their own good. The only person I  would say held back their tears was the vice principle and he had a legit reason to cry in some incenses.Art and music: 8Im combining the art and the music in the series just because they both were very good aspects of the series and fit well together. I felt that the ending song matched the story quite well because it had a dark mood but hopeful; which is what this anime was suppose to come off as. The intro song wasn\'t bad but i felt it was a little out of place because it felt like it was for a fighting type of movie rather than one where the characters cried more than they needed to.now the art is probably one of the best aspects of the series. It is captivating in many ways and it is very detailed. The art really gives a sense of the situation the girls are in and at the same time it also can leave a person in awe just because it is detailed and it sets a nice mood.Overall: 7I gave this anime a 7 because it had a lot of potential and was great, that is if you ignore the characters\' whining, some of their motives and the fact that some things in the series were just too convenient. For anyone that decided to watch this anime, i warn you that you should be committed to starting what you finished because while the story line and art of the series may be good, the characters will make you want to drop the show. If you can go 13 episodes without questioning motives, the convenience of things or why the characters have mood swing as if they were dying then you can enjoy it.', ""*spoilers*The premise sounds... promising. Genetically engineered girls go into deserted Tokyo to inspect the destruction wrought by a reactor that apparently ran on nerve gas, weapons grade plutonium, and the t-virus. Okay a little topical, but there's a lot of focus on the characters and how they feel about being engineered - oh what why can she tame that wolf so fast. Because she has a good sense of smell? Okay... you know what I'll go with it. Why why is that one crying and screaming. Well, I guess the scene was a little emotional, maybe I just didn't notice - Wait, wait a stealth...bomber? A B2 stealth bomber... owned by a corporation... secretly flying toxic waste... into nerve gas Tokyo... so they can dump it in a lake. Tell me, when they were at 20,00ft, did they happen to notice the ocean, because most corporations do. So, now we have a bazooka, and we're chasing a B-2 stealth bomber around in a jeep, though nerve gas Tokyo. And these girls FEEL SO MUCH!!! THEY CANT STOP FEELING! WHY WERE WE MADE!?! WHY!?!I think this was the only time I kept watching an anime simply because I thought it couldn't be as bad as it seemed. It was worse. The girls are so damn emotional, there's one of them I like just because she doesn't freak out quite so much. I think she freaked out once because she sympathized with this couple who I think abandoned their kid or something and she wanted everyone to know how much she FELT FOR THEM!!! Really, you may not believe the all caps are appropriate, and they''re not, because no writing can express how much she FEELS FOR YOU!!! The emotions are TOO MUCH!!! I mean there's a lot of stuff here to get upset about and to be scared of and their very existence I'm sure can be a source of anxiety but wow can they over do it. I cannot believe how much they can over do it.And then there was the part where we case a B-2 stealth bomber, trying to shoot it down with a bazooka one of the girls apparently had, and we are trying to kill these people on a plane because they had the nerve to dump toxic waste in a lake in an irradiated nerve gas zone. Guys if you're gonna feel so much how about feeling that its wrong to kill people just for improper disposal of industrial waste? And no I mean they are having a party hunting these people down and shooting them out of the sky over Tokyo. And everyone's behind them on this. And it doesn't get better after that.

They are genetically-modified human clones that are immune to radiation, miraculously heal from serious injuries, and have unique special abilities. These coppelion are conveniently deployed into the shell of the former Japanese capital, now a radioactive wasteland, in order to save the remnants of humanity there.When I think of nuclear wasteland, I think of the games S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Metro 2033, and Fallout. None of these games contain school girls in school uniforms who cry every time anything goes wrong. And yet this is exactly what GoHands has added to the theme, complete...with mini skirts and an extreme dose of estrogen. While the animation of Go Hands does justice to the post-apocalyptic cityscape of ""the Old Capital"", the lively personalities of the characters and the caliber of action don\'t follow this dark tone. For me, this action-adventure only fares slightly better than Kyoukai no Kanata, another series that desperately lacks a coherent atmosphere.Animation:This work shares a lot with other GoHands works. Again, a major city holds the scars of a disastrous accident as in K. The amazing clarity and detail found in K is carried over in Coppelion, except that everything is now rusted and overgrown, in contrast to the sparkly-clean look of K. The character animation is a bit different in that there are very clear outlines around the characters, making it quite obvious that they are superimposed in front of the background. I also found it a bit odd how the girls were able to keep their uniforms tidy and clean, despite sleeping and rolling in the dusty, grimy deserted city. The character designs are fair with distinguishable important characters. Somehow, Naruse reminds me of Shino, the student council chair in Seitokai Yakuindomo. Unlike K, we don\'t have overly bishounen guys.Though there is a lot of action in Coppelion, there isn\'t as much reliance on magic as in K. In its place is a lot of conventional firearm battles with antagonists who always spray lead almost universally resulting in a light show that misses the intended target. There is noticable CGI usage, especially in the earlier episodes. Expect blood and a bit of gore, though not anywhere near the level found in the games mentioned above. The more military/gamer-inclined viewer may take offense at the grievous misrepresentation of the B2 bomber, unrealistic effects of radiation, and copyright infringement of the Monkeylord from Supreme Commander. As there is no Neko in this show, don\'t expect there to be much in the fan service department.Sound:The show opens with a rock-based OP with weird-sounding gaps between the vocals. The show ends with a traditional-sounding song that feels like it fits with a Yakuza flick. It has a dark melody that, while not great, is much more melodic than the OP. The BGM is similar in instrumentation to that found in K, though with less emphasis, cohesion, and presence.The VAs do a good job giving their respective characters fitting personalities. Kana Hanazawa and Yui Horie do well in their supporting roles but I particularly liked Rikiya Koyama\'s performance as the general.Story:This is one of those series that you shouldn\'t take seriously if you want any to derive any enjoyment. From the ridiculous ""lead barrier"" holding the radiation in to characters coincidentally discovering functional RPGs in the ruins at critical moments, this show isn\'t going for any realism awards. At least plot-wise, there\'s much more continuity compared to what we saw in K.Basically, special ""human dolls"" called coppelion graduate from a special high school (training them in vital subjects such as how to use firearms and how to perform surgery) and are sent on various tasks in hazardous, radioactive environments. The show follows the medical team, a group of three whiny coppelion whose goal is to find and rescue/extract all the remaining humans in the city. The story is very episodic at first with the gals discovering various groups of people. Eventually, the story centralizes around rescuing a large group of people, which carries the plot to its climax. Along the way, convenient antagonists are introduced and mysterious winds interrupt at the worst of times. While there is continuity, the execution doesn\'t flow naturally.Since Coppelion are essentially scientifically-created clones, the story attempts to invoke the same morality questions and themes also recently found in Railgun S. Unfortunately, the theme was only lightly explored and had almost no real effect on the viewer. The story also touches upon the idea that there are people who may willingly want to live in the radioactive zone, free from the burdens imposed by the outside civilization. Ultimately, none of the themes are explored with enough detail, and many seemingly important side plots (such as the Prime Minister\'s past) are hinted at but never explored.In the end, this feels like an exploratory work; there are certain elements that are unique but a lot of core pieces are missing. What are the coppelion? Why is the rest of the world seemingly apathetic to the fact that Tokyo has been blown up? What kind of an engineer would think that building an experimental reactor in the center of mega city is a good idea? These critical questions, and more, will remain completely unanswered in the series.Character:The coppelion are as mysterious as the protagonist in K. Expect a lot of special abilities and cheesy last minute saves based on these abilities. While there is some depth to the main medical group, there isn\'t much explanation on the antagonists. A lot of emphasis is supposedly on the purpose of the coppelion and why they willingly follow what they are ordered to. My main gripe, however, is that antagonists completely change their mind, almost on a whim. One minute they\'re out to kill the protagonists, no holds barred. The next, they decide to just give up and join forces. This change in conviction just feels completely unnatural.Value:Coppelion is a nice looking show. It\'s got a pretty good atmosphere and a fairly unique setting. However, the characters didn\'t really grow on me and the unnatural pacing and execution didn\'t help either. If you\'re a huge GoHands fan then this might be for you. Otherwise, if you must get your fill of armageddon, watch something like Kaminai. It has a much richer atmosphere and likeable characters. If you\'re looking more for an action-scifi, Railgun S is a good alternative. with mini skirts and an extreme dose of estrogen.

I have seen so many reviews that say this was a disappointing anime. But I think that it wasn\'t disappointing at all. It had interesting plot and the art was really beautiful.The plot was pretty much same as in manga. There was not much difference from animes plot to mangas plot. They pretty much have the same story.And the art style is really cool, part from the weird filter that it had most of time.Of course this anime isn\'t perfect. But it was enjoyable. The characters and their relationships where...interesting.I suggest everyone who watches this anime to read the manga. Because the ending is amazing and there are more cool unique characters.Also go listen the opening song ""Angel"". It is a banger.(sorry if my English is bad, I was writing this half sleep) interesting.I suggest everyone who watches this anime to read the manga.

It is a banger.(sorry if my English is bad, I was writing this half sleep)', ""Coppelion is an interesting piece of media that wants to do a lot with the premise, however the direction it takes ends up slightly skewed into a drama of sorts that hurts the presentation of an otherwise decent piece of art.Story:  5/10Coppelion begins in the beautifully illustrated ruins of the post-nuclear accident city of Tokyo. We're introduced to our three protagonists: Ibara Naruse, Taeko Nomura, and Aoi Fukasaku, which are high school girls that have been genetically engineered to withstand the incredibly dangerous conditions of the city, trained since their coming into being to be a medical team tasked with locating and rescuing any...survivors that may be within the city's limits. They are known as the Coppelion. The series introduces you to the premise and builds the world effectively through an episodic structure until the overarching plot and main conflict present itself.This seems like an incredibly interesting idea for a series, and had it kept the episodic structure it could have been a pretty engaging experience. Once the major plot kicks in the story takes a nosedive and gets into a rhythm of problem solving, deus ex machina, and cliffhangers.Art:  9/10The art is the reason I was able to watch the series in its entirety. The background art depicting the ruins of the city in all of its grime and former glory is absolutely stunning. The muted color palette across the desolate buildings, crumbling city streets, and vacant ruins sets the tone for the beginning of the series to be a rather somber one. With such an intense presentation the choice to make the characters have thick, comic book style outlines was a welcome one. This helps them stand out from the backgrounds and gives the show a sense of conscious stylistic direction.Sound:  8/10I realized the sound in this anime had a lot more thought put into it the further along I got in the series. The music choices were all chosen well for the context they were presented in. The VAs do their job of presenting the character's personalities, their frustrations, trials, and burdens. This becomes very important as there are a lot of moments when characters have moments of introspection and their purpose.Character:  4/10I understand why the creators took the route they did with the girls. The reason for the characterization written into them is not lost on me. But it is annoying.Ibara Naruse is the leader of the group. She does most of the work while the other two protagonists either serve as plot devices or to support her. She has one goal of saving lives, and will do what she must to make sure that happens. Her passion for this makes her failures her moments of weakness. This contrasts with her incredibly super-human exterior.Taeko Nomura is possibly given the least characterization of the group. While she is somewhat competent and more useful than Aoi, her role remains much of the same as the focus is never shifted to her enough to get a read on her internal struggles. She exists to present the idea that Coppelion students can have engineered abilities, hers being that her senses are heightened.Aoi Fukasaku is the weakest link in the group. She is incredibly whiny and will continue to whine throughout the series. Her character, I believe, is supposed to represent the idea that even genetically engineered humans can have more of a sense of humanity, compassion, and empathy than real humans. I couldn't force myself to like this character, as she's never given any redeemable qualities within her characterization. You will tire of this character quickly.The rest of the cast is littered with people that either stand in the way of the protagonists, represent the duality of people in desperation, act as deus ex machina, or act as recurring villains that the protagonists must repeatedly be at odds with.Enjoyment: 6/10Overall: 5/10After my first few episodes of Coppelion I could not understand the hate it was getting, because I was enjoying it a lot. The premise was interesting, the art was interesting, the story up to that point was okay and the characters weren't destroying the show for me. Once the rest of the plot unfolded I started to understand the criticisms for this anime. The major flaws lie within the characters and the story, which are the most important aspects.

In the search for surviving inhabitants of the city, a trio of genetically engineered teens called Coppelion are tasked by the Japanese Self-Defense Force to track down survivors as all of them are immune to the negative effects of radiation and each have their own unique special ability.On the surface, Coppelion offers some storytelling themes that would make it seem like a solid sci-fi adventure title on paper. The series is set in...a ""what if"" future showing what could happen if Tokyo was ravaged by nuclear radiation as a result of the nuclear reactors that powers its society. Within this future, Ibara and the members of her Rescue Unit are tasked with tracking down survivors within the nuclear-ravaged Tokyo that offer up their moments of genuine suspense as the girls are often at risk when rescuing survivors between preventing victims from being exposed to high levels of radiation they can otherwise survive to enemy threats exploiting their survival efforts to stir up terrorist acts for their personal gain. The series also dabbles into questioning the humanity of others, which those among the Coppelion and whomever is left behind in the radiation-infested Tokyo dabble into as characters feeling like outcasts or not human due to being different from other people cope with these developments in varying ways, both good and bad.Unfortunately, Coppelion gets hurt greatly by the limited run time of its series length. At only 13 episodes, it felt like the series was trying to compact whatever storytelling it had to tell. Many of the characters get limited depth, mostly being reduced to character archetypes and not getting enough fleshing out to make their motives and developments relatable for me. Some major plot developments do get tacked on with melodrama that make emotional moments hard to take seriously at points and others that do not seem to get enough fleshing out, due to a mix of both the anime\'s seemingly compressed feel and the series also lacking a proper ending.Visually, things are a mixed bag for Coppelion. While sporting highly detailed and vast background shots of the barren Tokyo landscape, the quality of animation shots and character designs tend to vary. Designs of the various radiation suits worn by human characters have variety to their designs, but character designs often looked unrealistic in their bodily proportions and some shots inconsistently depict their designs with a thick outline that stick out prominently from the gorgeous background shots. Animation is hit-or-miss as there are some moments where shortcuts are relied upon to conserve on budget, while others feature some great animated sequences such as some later fight scenes with the Coppelion and a final battle involving a giant spider robot.Overall, Coppelion is a series that seemed like it wanted to explore quite a bit in its run, yet suffers since it is handicapped by its limited run time in how much it can explore within its 13-episode run. Perhaps if the series were given a longer run time, it could have had more time to convey its ideas and provide more fleshing out of its characters. But as it is, the series offers a solid premise on paper that is sadly crippled by the amount of time it has to tell its story. a ""what if"" future showing what could happen if Tokyo was ravaged by nuclear radiation as a result of the nuclear reactors that powers its society.

Animation is hit-or-miss as there are some moments where shortcuts are relied upon to conserve on budget, while others feature some great animated sequences such as some later fight scenes with the Coppelion and a final battle involving a giant spider robot.Overall, Coppelion is a series that seemed like it wanted to explore quite a bit in its run, yet suffers since it is handicapped by its limited run time in how much it can explore within its 13-episode run. Perhaps if the series were given a longer run time, it could have had more time to convey its ideas and provide more fleshing out of its characters. But as it is, the series offers a solid premise on paper that is sadly crippled by the amount of time it has to tell its story.', 'Now I have read so many different options on this anime and people seem to love it or trash it. In my option many people go in thinking its gonna be one thing when its not. the story\'s not really apocalyptic as in zombies and monsters but as in a modern day dystopia. The manga is also pretty every on the si-fi close to where the anime ends.The problem I see people talk about with Coppelion the most is it\'s pacing. The first 3-5 episodes focuses are single stories to help create world building and I can understand how you go from that to the...main plot and feel kinda weird. But its not as bad as other popular anime\'s (Tokyo ghoul not a bad show but the pacing for the first season is weird) Now the other problem I find with the show is the 3 main female characters. Aoi is especially I understand why she\'s winy (because she doesn\'t know what her power is) But people who only watch the anime and haven\'t/don\'t want to read the manga won\'t know that and that\'s a problem with any anime that tries to build characters but runs out of time due to episode restrictions.Now the good stuff I love the look to this anime, every review I\'ve read says the animation is amazing and its true! It feels very trunoble. The Next thing is the story. Its feels like if the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster happened but in Tokyo; And instead of it being ""contained"" Things just got out of hand leaving the whole city to become a toxic waste land The thought that went into the story is very fun. The manga does have the problem of feeling kinda slow because they add so much info on why things are happing, but the anime fixed that right up. (too much world building but also kinda needed) idk if this is why people say the pacing  for the show is weird idk it seems fine to me.In all I have given it a high mark because its a unique story (hard to come by nowadays with every anime feeling so similar) But also because I really enjoyed it. Yes it has some problems but nothing big enough to wreck the viewing experience. main plot and feel kinda weird.

So that begs the question of why I gave this a 3 out of 10. We all know that means ""Very Bad"". Well, spoiler alert: It really sinks downhill fast. Episode 3 was where it started with some flaws but it was still tolerable at the time but by Episode 6, I can no longer consider it a good anime.The story, in my opinion, is the most important part for any form of fiction (slice of life is a notable exception though sort of). A post-apocalyptic environment...is one of my favourite set-ups. The concept of genetic engineering also adds to it as being able to survive the environment despite the radiation there. The problem is that the plot diverts from three girls saving the inhabitants of the area to a war with other Coppelion and saving a pregnant woman. Unfortunately, this is poorly played out and our protagonists make some really stupid decisions. I mean it can work if they make stupid decisions if they face the consequences of it AND learn from it but they never learn. There are several plotholes as well such as one of the characters dying from something that really shouldn\'t be able to kill them (vagary intended to avoid spoilers as best I can while providing this example) and one part of dumping waste is completely forgotten about. This gives it a 2 out of 10 for the story.The art and sound are pretty great and good respectively but sometimes the sound is a bit poor. There\'s not much to comment on those two but the art is among some of the best I\'ve seen and I would even add a point to the anime for it even though I don\'t like it.The characters are poor overall (not financially lol). So our three protagonists are Ibara, Aoi and Taeko. I\'ll start with initial views on these three first and then get to how my view of them is beforehand as well as some supporting characters. Ibara was a badass at the start and was positioned as a tough yet caring person. She\'d never let anything get in the way of her work and always put forward the lives of others before her own even if it will in no way benefit her. I was never really a fan of Aoi. She can be adorable at times but she kinda squeals a lot and contributes nothing to the story even when it was good. Aoi seemed a bit of a burden. Finally, Taeko never really stood out that much. Like Aoi, she never really did anything of contribution either (for now) but unlike Aoi, she wasn\'t annoying and did have her uses, such as her sight.However, as the series progressed, I have started to like Ibara less and less. I can understand that it is hard to kill someone (not completely as I\'ve never attempted to kill anyone and I really hope I never will be in that situation) but sometimes, it actually seems like killing someone is the best course of action. This is done with the two sisters who are clearly sociopathic murderers with no redeeming qualities so keeping them alive can actually be endangering to people\'s lives, which does go against the point of Ibara\'s work. She also tries too hard to Jesus them into the good side but it\'s never really convincing and she never learns that they will not reform despite the countless times she\'s tried. In the sixth episode, her near-death was through no one\'s fault but her own since she also dropped her guard (which is something she did not do early on). If that was part of her character, I wouldn\'t complain but it\'s not. She was built up as a professional at these things and was certainly prepared in the second episode for her own safety. Aoi never changed really. She remained annoying and there was only one instance where she wasn\'t as useless as an air conditioner on Antarctica. This is never shown again however and she remains cowardly and has gotten herself into trouble quite a bit actually. The only one of the three that actually got better as the series progressed was Taeko as we started seeing more of her. She did take a hit for the pregnant woman she was rescuing which was an admirable sacrifice and she was there for her when she was giving birth to keep her safe, which is a very important cause to make sure the child is safe when born. Unfortunately, Taeko\'s character development is not enough to save the others.As for the other characters, Haruto started off awesome but became a little dull as the series went on and many of the other characters with the exceptions of the Ozu sisters and No sense were forgettable. The Ozu sisters I actually liked because of how batshit insane they are. I always like insane villains who go to that extra dark length and as I said before, they are sociopathic as hell. However, their redemption was not credible and it made their end of the story disappointing as hell. No sense is best girl basically, a comment which will lead me to the next section.Enjoyment is higher than it should be really as despite hating the show, I did enjoy watching it for how bad it was. I saw it an anime club at a screening and it was recently finished. A lot of our comments on the show were joking about its plotholes and such. Sometimes I love watching crap so I did enjoy myself a bit there. But in a serious matter, I would not enjoy it at all (except the start).Overall, it\'s a 3 out of 10 and I highly recommend you don\'t watch this.

I haven\'t read the manga but after watching this anime, I don\'t really want to.', 'Overview:""Coppelion"" is an interesting anime to be sure, combining elements from the post-apocalyptic and magical girl genres among others to create something that appears like nothing you\'ve ever seen before. Unfortunately, good ideas are little more than novelties without someone who can actually make the most out of them, and ""Coppelion""\'s execution of its ideas never manages to be anything more than middling, resulting in an anime that has a lot of issues and untapped potential.Story (6.5/10):""Coppelion"" is set in the year 2036, 20 years after a nuclear meltdown made Tokyo uninhabitable due to the increased radioactivity making it impossible for normal people to survive...without adequate protection. Understandably, this means that the city is now treated as a quarantine zone, with the government banning anyone from entering the city without proper authorization. The story is centred around the titular Coppelion, genetically engineered teenagers who are usually, but not always, female and were enhanced specifically to be able to survive in Tokyo\'s atmosphere without the need for a radiation suit, and each have a special ability that\'s unique to them. One such person is our protagonist and heroine Ibara Naruse, the leader of the Coppelion Rescue Unit who, along with her two best friends Aoi Fukasaku and Taeko Nomura, is sent to Tokyo in order to search for and rescue any people unlucky enough to still be caught within Tokyo\'s walls.The story starts off well enough, as we gradually learn various bits and pieces about the world and Coppelion. For example, the academy that trains Coppelion functions a lot like a normal high school, with Ibara being a third-year student, Aoi and Taeko being first-years and their main contact being referred to as the vice-principal. Furthermore, as artificially created beings, Coppelion are generally treated as a separate species from humans, with their name being derived from the real-life French play ""Coppelia"", which is a story about a living doll, which the Coppelions are often referred to as. Naturally, this means that several Coppelion, like Ibara and Aoi, have serious insecurities in regards to their origins, which helps flesh out their characters. While the series starts off episodic, a story arc begins in the fifth episode, and while that would usually result in a series getting better, that is unfortunately not the case here, as said arc ends up lasting the entirety of the remaining nine episodes. The reason this is a problem is because the plot is thin enough that it could easily have been wrapped up in three or four episodes at most, with it only lasting as long as it does because a bunch of subplots happen in-between, resulting in a story that\'s both slow and seriously lacks focus, which is especially bad for an anime that\'s only 13 episodes long. What\'s more is that arguably the most emotional episode is the second, with no subsequent episode quite matching the gut-punches of that one.Besides the poor pacing, the story is dragged down further by some of the corniest writing ever. Seriously, there are times when I found myself throwing my hands up in the air at how utterly trite and clichéd some of the lines were, especially when they came out of the mouths of characters I generally liked. Even worse is that these lines are sometimes said completely out of context, when absolutely nothing has happened to warrant them being said. Additionally, while the arc is ultimately wrapped up fairly decently, you nevertheless get the impression that the Coppelion\'s overall journey is still just getting started, which may have more than a bit to do with the fact that the anime only adapts the first few of 26 volumes of manga. All in all, the story has its high points and low points, but is pretty average overall.Art & Animation (7/10):""Coppelion"" looks pretty much unlike any other anime out there, and not in a good way. While the environments are nice-looking enough, the character models are seriously lacking, having the bare minimum of detail and plenty of rough edges, not to mention they don\'t fit in with the environments at all. Some of the objects also look like they were just sketched on and the animation is pretty lacking in places too. Overall, the visuals are highly inconsistent in quality, with some shots looking great while others look awful.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):""Coppelion""\'s sound design is, by a wide margin, the best thing about it. While the music that plays during the episodes themselves isn\'t all that notable, the opening ""Angel"" is great and the ending theme ""Far"" is absolutely fantastic, to the point that I found myself listening to the latter at the end of every episode. What\'s consistently great, however, is the voice acting. In fact, if there\'s one thing this anime is worth noting for, it\'s helping kickstart the careers of Erica Lindbeck and Max Mittelman, who provide the voices of Ibara and Haruto respectively, and nowadays are far better known as Futaba Sakura and Ryuji Sakamoto in ""Persona 5"", amongst many other roles. Add in a number of other great talents including Cherami Leigh, Cassandra Lee Morris, Richard Epcar, Sarah Williams and Keith Silverstein, and you have yourself a surprisingly solid cast, which goes a long way to alleviate the often corny script.Characters (6.5/10):If I were to describe Ibara Naruse in one word, that word would be “kind”. While she can be rather stiff and formal, she is overall a very friendly and compassionate girl who cares deeply for others and always willing to help anyone in need. And while she won’t hesitate to fight when it’s necessary, which she does so very well with her super strength and enhanced reflexes, she will always draw the line when it comes to killing anyone, and refuses to let anyone else kill either, which makes sense considering she’s part of a rescue team, so her mission is to save lives, not take them. However, while her desire to save everyone is undeniably noble, there’s also a rather tragic side to it; as an artificially created being who’s been training her whole life to save people, Ibara believes that saving people is her whole reason for living. Essentially, she helps people partially because it’s the right thing to do and partially because she believes she otherwise has no purpose in life, and so whenever someone tells her they don’t need her help or that they don’t want to be saved (which actually happens more often than you’d think), she feels as though she’s being denied the purpose she’s been given. Overall, while I did feel she could be annoyingly self-righteous at times, and there’s ultimately nothing remarkable about her character, she nevertheless stood out as my favourite, not that there’s much competition.My second favourite character would have to be Aoi Fukasaku. On the surface, she seems to be the cheerful, happy-go-lucky member of the trio, and doesn’t seem to be particularly bothered by the fact that she’s an artificial human who was raised in what’s essentially a military academy, even saying there are some benefits to it. Overtime, however, we see that this carefree attitude is really just a façade, and she’s actually the most insecure of the three girls, more so even than Ibara. This stems from the fact that, at first glance, she seems to be the only one unable to do anything; while Ibara has enhanced strength and athletics and Taeko has heightened senses (with the glasses she wears being used to tone down her enhanced eyesight), Aoi doesn’t seem to have any special abilities beyond being able to breath Tokyo’s radioactive atmosphere (which is an ability all Coppelion possess). This causes her to have an identity crisis mid-season, believing that she does nothing but drag down everyone around her, which naturally leads to a character arc where she gradually realises her own self-worth and what she can contribute to the group as a whole. It’s a development that’s been done to death in Japanese media in particular, but it’s nevertheless done quite well here, and it certainly helps that Aoi provides some much-needed comic relief too.As good as Ibara and Aoi are, I had a lot of problems with the rest of the cast. A few episodes in, we’re introduced to Haruto Kurosawa, Ibara’s childhood friend and a third-year like her. Unlike Ibara, however, he’s a member of the Coppelion Cleanup Crew, which basically means that he has no qualms with killing people, which puts him at odds with Ibara despite their history together. He also has a strong hatred for ordinary humans due to what he went through when he was younger, and as such can’t understand why Ibara cares about them so much, with him only really helping them because it’s his job. Unfortunately, his rather late introduction and sparse screentime throughout means he isn’t given that many moments to shine, which is a shame as I found the dynamic between him and Ibara to be the most interesting in the series. Additionally, Taeko, despite being part of the core trio, doesn’t do much of note either, as while she plays an important role in the first few episodes, she gets sidelined pretty much as soon as the main story begins and remains such for the rest of the series. What’s more is that unlike her fellow Coppelion, Taeko doesn’t show any real insecurity over her origins, meaning her character isn’t as developed as Ibara, Aoi or even Haruto. And speaking of underdeveloped characters, most of the ordinary human characters are fairly bland, mostly serving either as confidants for the Coppelion or people for them to save, with very few notable personality traits or quirks. The main villains are also a bit of a bore, as while they have a tragic reason for their actions, said reason is only really mentioned once in the whole series, and apart from that they act no differently from your typical cackling, misanthropic psychopaths with no motivation beyond chaos for its own sake.Enjoyment (7/10):I must admit that there are times when “Coppelion” can be pretty boring, as it’s not uncommon for there to be long periods without any real action, which isn’t helped by the show’s poor pacing. When action scenes do happen, however, they are definitely entertaining, if by no means spectacular to due the rather average animation. Being a post-apocalyptic series, it can also be rather grim at times, particularly when the Coppelion fail to save someone. Still, it’s never to the point where you feel like puking, which is helped by the fact that Ibara and Aoi both lighten the mood in their own ways.Overall:“Coppelion” is an anime that could have been brilliant, but barely even scratches the surface of its potential. Sound-wise, it’s very pleasant to the ears, but it also has numerous underdeveloped characters, highly inconsistent visuals and a story that still feels like it’s just getting started even towards the end. Ultimately, this is a series that’s best saved for a day where you have nothing else to watch, and you’ve had your fill of the post-apocalyptic genre, you’re better off just avoiding it completely.Score:6.5+7+8.5+6.5+7=35.5/50=7.1/10 without adequate protection.

Still, it’s never to the point where you feel like puking, which is helped by the fact that Ibara and Aoi both lighten the mood in their own ways.Overall:“Coppelion” is an anime that could have been brilliant, but barely even scratches the surface of its potential. Sound-wise, it’s very pleasant to the ears, but it also has numerous underdeveloped characters, highly inconsistent visuals and a story that still feels like it’s just getting started even towards the end. Ultimately, this is a series that’s best saved for a day where you have nothing else to watch, and you’ve had your fill of the post-apocalyptic genre, you’re better off just avoiding it completely.Score:6.5+7+8.5+6.5+7=35.5/50=7.1/10', ""Simply put, Coppelion is boring. It's definitely not a keeper, and not something I would ever watch again.Story & Setting:The story is too simple. Three girls who have been genetically enhanced to be immune to radiation are sent to the ruins of a radiated Tokyo in search for survivors. They spend most episodes rescuing survivors and fighting some hostile ones. That’s all there is to it. The story lacks a hook. The cliffhangers didn't leave me in any suspense. After a couple of episodes, I didn’t feel much immersed in the anime, or care much for the characters. After half the episodes were over, I...was so bored with the anime that I almost dropped it. But I decided to push through and finish anyway. The story doesn’t change at all.Characters:The worst thing about the anime is the characters. The three main females are boring, one-sided, and very melodramatic. They cry many times throughout the anime for all kinds of reasons. Despite being trained by the government, the girls seem poorly disciplined and ill-prepared. They constantly let their emotions get in the way. They even wear regular school uniforms, like they’re out on a field trip. The only supplies they have are stocked in backpacks, which include a “magic” Geiger counter which clicks whenever human survivors are nearby.Ibara acts as the selfless and brave leader. She is a bit too good at everything she does, so she often comes across a bit like a Mary-Sue. She is only one in the team who is useful. Aoi is pretty useless and spends most of her time either whining or getting herself into trouble. She spends several episodes inside a room by herself, thinking about how useless she is. Taeko doesn’t get to do much either, as she spends a lot of time resting and recovering after getting shot. She then spends a few episodes tending to a pregnant woman. Neither Taeko nor Aoi is of any use to Ibara. She constantly has to order them around. Without her, they don’t know what to do. You might roll your eyes and groan at them a lot.The villains are pretty boring. They want to radiate the entire world for stupid, self-destructive reasons. They are rarely a threat to the protagonists. The show even includes a stupid cliché with the protagonists trying to save the villains’ lives despite them trying to murder them all the time. And then the villains suddenly become good and decide to join the protagonists. It’s sooo cheesy.Animation & Music:The art and animations are nothing special. Most of the scenes consist of city ruins and overgrown vegetation. There's really nothing to say about the music. was so bored with the anime that I almost dropped it.

They have amazing production values to offer a level of eye candy very few are capable of, and they are always wasting it on subpar titles that offer nothing besides cool premises and lots of fan service (Seitokai Yakuindomo, Mardock Scramble, K Project). Their latest work of bad art is this Coppelion, which is about some schoolgirls looking for survivors in a radioactive area of Japan. Many were mesmerized by the very good animation and artwork, which was creating a most creepy post-apocalyptic setting and thought it would be a very...mature and thought-provoking series.Me? Just looking at the premise I knew right away it will be a big failure. I mean, SCHOOLGIRLS IN THE ROLE OF RESCUE RANGERS! How much more obvious could it be to smell the BS from ten miles away? Something about the voice actors being amazing, or that they delayed the creation of this show for a year because of that tsunami that struck Japan, so it has to be great for having all this time to work on it. If you ask me, they should have canceled it the second someone proposed the idea of actually making a show out of this anecdote of a premise.Oh, but wait, maybe I was just being too biased and the show is actually good! Maybe they actually did something with the premise later on and I was wrong to condemn it immediately! So what if we have schoolgirls instead of properly trained military personnel sent to do these rescue missions? This way we will have far more emotional responses out of them and each mission will be more about survival/horror than just guns blazing.… Nope, the obvious failure was obvious after all. All these attempts to make the series more “humane” as some hoped it would be, ended up being its undoing. You think there is any other reason than fan service for these girls to be sent in school uniforms and not proper military uniforms?“Maybe this way the survivors will find them cute and trust them easier than if they were scary looking soldiers.”… Nope, it was the usual bullshit that plagues modern anime and nothing else.“Oh come on, there is definitely a lot more going on that this. The girls are not normal! They are immune to radiation, and their skin is very pale, and they are probably part of some sinister human experiment.”Even if they are, does it even mean anything? All we see them doing is acting completely inappropriately for the mission they have, like typical immature schoolgirls instead of the specially bred and trained super soldiers they are supposed to be. The whole mystery and conspiracy theories are just background noise if all we see is that nonsense. There is absolutely no immersion to the themes of the story. Something about being treated as objects and not as people? Who cares? Not even the girls do; they cry for a few minutes and then forget it and move on before they remember they have to cry again about it. It would be lovely if they were actually doing something about it, but no, it all amounts to ephemeral mood swings. Said mood swings just come out of nowhere and there is no time invested on their doll issue. Even if you get a gasping revelation later on, you just don’t give a damn because you were never made to take anything seriously. And the worst part is how the series is not supposed to be comedy but a sociopolitical drama.“Well, at least the girls are cute this way and not some uninteresting military brutes. And you must keep in mind how they don’t have radiation-immune adult soldiers yet, and they were forced to send these teenage girls who are at a very sensitive age. It is normal for them to be acting a bit emotional and not following orders.”Whatever, all I see is inappropriately behaving (and dressed) people sent to the wrong mission. All that fuss about they have no time to send others or that the government is pressuring the military to take action, or that thousands may die if they don’t act now, THEY MEAN NOTHING! I can’t take it seriously! I mean can you imagine a news reporter trying to describe this situation without laughing his ass off? And it’s also supposed to be a serious situation!Even if you don’t mind the ludicrous plot, you can’t even enjoy it for the characters. Not only is the characterization bare bones, not only you are facepalming with the way the heroines are dressed, not only you are cringing your teeth every time they cry for close to no reason (that is, all the time), but you are also left with essentially ONE girl doing all the work, while the other two are just crying in a corner, or eat rice cakes and comment on how pretty the lake looks. There aren’t even any other interesting secondary characters to take notice; most disappear after a single episode. Throw in some plot twists that make no sense, such as creating rescue rangers out of clones of psychotic mass murderers, and huge mecha hiding inside a city. Why did they throw such thing in there? Because it would make things more interesting, and not because it makes sense whatsoever. And as always YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE ALL THAT SERIOUSLY!Well, I can’t.

Changes of course had to be done, but the number of changes were a little too much for my tastes.The main disappointment was just how weak they made the heroines' powers.

Other times the the US version is judged unfairly by people who never even saw it. Today\'s review is an example of a shitty adaptation of an American cartoon. Have you ever wished that some country would take a beloved US cartoon and do to it what the Yanks did to ""The Wicker Man?"" This is that cartoon!Background:The original Power Puff girls was a popular US cartoon during the animation bubble of...the 1990s. During the 90s, nearly every channel on American TV had a Saturday morning cartoon lineup and over 200 American cartoons were airing in any given year of that decade. In 2015 only 2 channels on US TV are airing cartoons and their are no more than 20 current American cartoons. This was a double edged sword because while the total number of awesome cartoon series was much higher during the 1990s, the average quality was actually lower. There were some BAD cartoons in the 1990s like the Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter cartoons made by the USA Channel that would never pass current expectations of quality.Power Puff Girls (same writers as 4chan\'s beloved MLP) was one of the top tier or roughly top 10 percent cartoons of the 90s decade.So what did the original do well?1. It featured cute character designs that paid homage to and parodied anime, which was a fairly new concept in the US.2.It had lots of action, much of which was also heavily anime inspired. One of the early fights between Blossom and Princess was directly taken from the first Goku vs. Vegeta fight from DBZ!3. Power Puff had MUCH younger and more ""hip"" writers that knew how to make pop culture references that actually hit home for the current generation. An example would be when they did a  hilarious spoof on the then brand new 1998 Zelda game ""Ocarina of Time"" and Navi\'s extreme obnoxiousness. This was the decade when we had many shows with octogenarian writers like Hey Arnold, Doug, and others making constant references to Peter Lorre, Frank Sinatra, Mickey Mantel, and other 1950s pop culture jokes! Kids literally had to watch with their GRANDPARENTS to get the pop culture jokes in those shows! Power Puff was one of the first US cartoons written by younger writers in their 20s and early 30s for a young audience of kids and teens.4. It didn\'t just patronize kids and offered some moral complexity and occasional witty writing instead of REALLY stupid PSA commentaries.5. It could occasionally be surprisingly dark and wasn\'t afraid to push boundaries, but it also knew not to take itself TOO seriously and kept a balanced tone.6. It actually had pretty good music and excellent animation for an American TV cartoon of its time.7. It was freaking funny! My elder cousin would watch this show with me when he babysat me and my brother. He was a tough guy who was on his college\'s rugby team and was a bar bouncer and even he laughed his ass off!Damashita Power Puff Girls Z and why it DIDN\'T work!:1. The Art Design: The character models are changed to be more realistic and less cutesy. This is a show for little kids! What\'s wrong with cutesy?! The girls in the anime version are WAY too oversexualized and it gives this show a very creepy, pedo vibe. These girls are in KINDERGARTEN for fuck sake! The redesigns of the villains are also just stupid as hell!2. The Animation: PPG Z is 10 years newer than the original PPG and the animation is FAR worse. Of course this was animated by God Damn Toei, so you know exactly what to expect! The last popular American cartoon that had as low quality animation as 2000s decade Toei was the first few seasons of Ninja Turtles in the mid 1980s!3. The Writing: Remember how I said the original PPG had generally good writing and was very pop culture savvy? PPG Z has NONE of that! PPG Z makes every character unbearably annoying, takes itself too seriously at times when it shouldn\'t, and has jokes that either fall flat or induce serious cringing. The Rowdy Rough boys peeing on people? Seriously?! Who green lights this shit!?4. The Entertainment Value: The original PPG was a fun show that even older audiences like parents could watch with their kids and enjoy. PPG Z is about as entertaining as having your fingernails ripped off one by one. Even for little kids this shit isn\'t entertaining!5. The Retcons: An adaptation is free to change things like background, time, etc. However, the changes made here were overwhelmingly for the worse. In the original show the girls were born with super powers and like Superman had to learn how to live among normal people. This was done in an interesting way and provided both laughs and some introspection. In PPG Z the girls are normal students that transform into heroes and are basically like every Magical Girl ever made! The villain backgrounds are changed and none of them are as amusing or creative. The setting is changed to Japan, but doesn\'t take advantage of this change by integrating any elements of Japanese culture or giving a REASON for the change. It is just a ripoff PPG that happens to be set in Japan for some reason.Overall:I can now finally understand the anger that British people feel when watching the American versions of Top Gear! This was just PAINFUL to sit through! Even by the 1990s low standards of a kid\'s show and assuming I hadn\'t seen the original it would STILL be a terrible fucking show! This is one the worst adaptations of a children\'s movie or show I have ever seen! I think that giving it a rating of ""2"" is being generous! the 1990s. During the 90s, nearly every channel on American TV had a Saturday morning cartoon lineup and over 200 American cartoons were airing in any given year of that decade. In 2015 only 2 channels on US TV are airing cartoons and their are no more than 20 current American cartoons. This was a double edged sword because while the total number of awesome cartoon series was much higher during the 1990s, the average quality was actually lower. There were some BAD cartoons in the 1990s like the Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter cartoons made by the USA Channel that would never pass current expectations of quality.Power Puff Girls (same writers as 4chan\'s beloved MLP) was one of the top tier or roughly top 10 percent cartoons of the 90s decade.So what did the original do well?1. It featured cute character designs that paid homage to and parodied anime, which was a fairly new concept in the US.2.It had lots of action, much of which was also heavily anime inspired. One of the early fights between Blossom and Princess was directly taken from the first Goku vs. Vegeta fight from DBZ!3. Power Puff had MUCH younger and more ""hip"" writers that knew how to make pop culture references that actually hit home for the current generation. An example would be when they did a  hilarious spoof on the then brand new 1998 Zelda game ""Ocarina of Time"" and Navi\'s extreme obnoxiousness. This was the decade when we had many shows with octogenarian writers like Hey Arnold, Doug, and others making constant references to Peter Lorre, Frank Sinatra, Mickey Mantel, and other 1950s pop culture jokes! Kids literally had to watch with their GRANDPARENTS to get the pop culture jokes in those shows! Power Puff was one of the first US cartoons written by younger writers in their 20s and early 30s for a young audience of kids and teens.4. It didn\'t just patronize kids and offered some moral complexity and occasional witty writing instead of REALLY stupid PSA commentaries.5. It could occasionally be surprisingly dark and wasn\'t afraid to push boundaries, but it also knew not to take itself TOO seriously and kept a balanced tone.6. It actually had pretty good music and excellent animation for an American TV cartoon of its time.7. It was freaking funny! My elder cousin would watch this show with me when he babysat me and my brother. He was a tough guy who was on his college\'s rugby team and was a bar bouncer and even he laughed his ass off!Damashita Power Puff Girls Z and why it DIDN\'T work!:1. The Art Design: The character models are changed to be more realistic and less cutesy. This is a show for little kids! What\'s wrong with cutesy?! The girls in the anime version are WAY too oversexualized and it gives this show a very creepy, pedo vibe. These girls are in KINDERGARTEN for fuck sake! The redesigns of the villains are also just stupid as hell!2. The Animation: PPG Z is 10 years newer than the original PPG and the animation is FAR worse. Of course this was animated by God Damn Toei, so you know exactly what to expect! The last popular American cartoon that had as low quality animation as 2000s decade Toei was the first few seasons of Ninja Turtles in the mid 1980s!3. The Writing: Remember how I said the original PPG had generally good writing and was very pop culture savvy? PPG Z has NONE of that! PPG Z makes every character unbearably annoying, takes itself too seriously at times when it shouldn\'t, and has jokes that either fall flat or induce serious cringing. The Rowdy Rough boys peeing on people? Seriously?! Who green lights this shit!?4.

After seeing the whole thing you can see how they stayed true to the original series, partially. They kept the old villains looks, personalities, and motives the same but also introduced some of their own to mix it up.What bothered me the most were some of the cliches and overall placement of....well everything.Complicated problems are solved within seconds, Professor Utonium has always built some new invention right on time in order to save the day, and they cram things that should span episodes into about 5 minutes.Everything seemed small scaled, even the girls powers which if...you knew the original show they were quite a destructive force. But now its just ""Ill steal these bananas then take over the world"" or ""I\'ll get this boy to like me"". Things dont really pick up until the end.The overall feeling you get from the entire series is that it\'s filler and its true, you could remove over half the episodes and still keep what little continuity it had.Even fans of the original PPG will find it hard to watch. I\'d recommend it if you are 14 or under. you knew the original show they were quite a destructive force.

I\'d recommend it if you are 14 or under.', 'So I know what the first comments are going to be, it’s a Powerpuff Girls knockoff. And to that, I would say yes and no. This is a slightly different story as the girls were not created with sugar, spice, and everything nice with a toxic element, but were normal school girls given powers. Yes, they made the Powerpuff Girls into an actually magical girl story with secret identities and such. They even have a ‘transformation’ sequence as the girls turn into superheroes.Let me go over the storyline, and just to let you know, I only saw the English one so if the Japanese is...different (Thank god first off if it is) then I haven’t been able to see it. So, the story is that Professor Utonium and his young son Ken were playing around with chemical X, and ended up stabilizing it with a porkbun into chemical Z. When strange weather threatens the world, Ken is quick to shoot chemical Z into an iceberg even before testing it. This sends out black and white Z rays. The black ones hitting many different items and people to make them into ‘evil’ forms of themselves, and the white Z rays hit 3 girls who go to the same school but didn’t know each other really as they protected three kids playing games. These girls turn into the Powerpuff Girls and the creatures turned into their enemies.This storyline brings up more questions then answers as why a porkbun ended up stabilizing a chemical in the first place, why the z rays turned into two different forms (Though they slightly give a answer to this, it doesn’t make much sense still), and just how the hell the girls got powers from what the children were playing with at the time. Let me explain, Bubbles got a weapon that was a Yoyo from a kid playing with one, Bubbles got a bubble wand from protecting a kid blowing bubbles…. And Buttercup got a hammer from a kid playing with a Daruma Otoshi. For those who have no idea what that is, it is a old game where you stack up pieces and try to knock them out of the tower from top to bottom without letting the pieces fall over. I guess they had to figure out some sort of attack for Buttercup.So let’s see if there personalities make up for the strange storyline… Blossom’s personality is a really annoying and overly whinny. She isn’t like the cool leader in the original show and pretty much made her a nerd that’s into comics and superheroes. She just feels like they exaggerated the worst out of her. The Blossom I remember from the American version was a nerd but book smart, not an over dramatic Superhero lover. Bubbles is way too ditsy as though they took the idea of her being blond to a whole another level. At least with the American version she had the aspect of them being kindergarteners but it’s a different story when the characters are middle school level. Then it just feels like they should know better. Anyway, she grew up in a very traditional Japanese traditional household with her grandmother and a strict background though somehow she has become really into fashion. The only one that seems to be right is Buttercup in that she is the most tomboyish of the group, not really interested in the girly style. Want to know why Blossom and Bubbles wanted to be superheroes? Its not because of wanting to protect the city, its because they want to protect the store Blossom gets her snacks and Bubbles get her outfits… even the original girls were not that conceded. Though they end up wanting to protect everything else later on, they just still end up selfish with their bickering of who is the leader, the concept that when they are at the lab, they can do whatever they please and eat whatever they want, watch whatever they want and so on.The other thing about this show is that there are a lot of odd transitions. Here is a example, Mojo Jojo is taking over New Townsville (Like it wouldn’t have just been as easy to call it Townsville? It has the same dopey mayor and Miss Bellum.) by throwing little preschoolers into a cage and stealing their candy and the Powerpuff Girls go to take him down. In the middle of the battle, the whole group stops, including the mayor and Miss Bellum who are watching the fight, just to have some ice cream. Talk about a face palm moment. I just feel like my brain is melting because of how stupid this show is half the time and yet I chose to take a look at it on my own. I was a big fan of the original but this show just makes me feel stupid. Can I mention that the story also revolves around them keeping their power a secret from everyone but the professor, his son, their talking dog (I’m not getting into that), the mayor, and Miss Bellum. They always have to make a excuse to leave the classroom, and instead of saying they have to save the world which these countless important people could clarify, the girls say they have a stomachache or they have heartburn of the brain or something even more stupid then that. I would think the teachers would actually tell them no after a while. If the mayor knows and appointed them as heroes, then the whole town should probably know including the school. Something like a mayor order that when people are in trouble, they can go save the day or something. Do we really need these lame excuses? It even goes as far as their teacher wanting to give them more homework because of it so that just seems to be doing the opposite of what they should do. There was even a episode where the principle said that if they left their test, they would be kicked out of school so the professor and his son had to end up saving the day… which the whole matter could probably have been taken care of if they actually told the school everything.The artwork is actually rather good though very bubbly. Practically everything feels plastic and way to shinny. Actually, the whole anime feels like it’s made for small children and yet a couple of the jokes are ones children won’t understand. I just…. Ugg. It’s sad because the artwork looks so nice and fluid with bright colors, much like a comedy should. Even the outfits they wear have a bit more of a design to them instead of just a dress that looks like a moomoo that was so prevalent in the original. So why can’t they just have this artwork and keep to the well made script.There are two opening that I listened to. The first being the England version that just sounds like they made a strange instrumental version of what they thought it should be. The other was a really good Japanese version that was really good. So good that I wonder why they didn’t keep it for the episodes. They played the Japanese in episode 21 but more on that later. The English script is so comedic that it’s hard to even understand what the hell is going on. The whole thing is just a big joke. There is just so much stuff crammed into one show that makes no sense. Sometimes there is a moral to the show but then other times they seem to just cram something in like ‘don’t eat to much candy’ or ‘sometimes its good to take a break’ but then they have nothing else about it. It’s just thrown in to be a lesson but it has no base for the whole show The voices are not that bad though, just slightly annoying. The ending songs seem to almost always be different for some reason which makes me wonder just why it is like that. The show isn’t that great that they could put that much more time into having each ending be different, I think I counted like 5 different endings they used. There are a lot of things they could have done to make it better and not waste money on the endings.Now when I got to episode 21, there was a change to the soundtracks. They had the original Japanese opening, and a rather catchy transformation song that sounded so much better. I think the transformation song was Japanese because it had the Japanese pronunciations to their names. This was close to a godsend for me because it was better then what they had placed before. At least it was a little bit more bearable to watch. Sadly, this only happened for one episode and then they went back to stupidity, even going as far as calling Takoyaki a pastry puff. For crying out loud, the place that was making them had octopus on it. What Pastry Puff bakery would have an octopus on their sign? There are other cultural differences that just made this hurt to watch. It feels like it was mostly done by 4kids and not Catroon Network the way they re-dubbed it.There was one point that I thought was going to save this anime. Episode 46 had a rather intense fight scene with the ‘leading’ enemy,HIM (though he really does not show up much and is normally easy to take out with just a bit of cold), and the girls learning more of how to fight with there weapons. Weapons they have had for the last 46 episodes mind you (and yes, I am counting the one they only had them for a brief time). They should have figured this out before hand but oh well, they wanted to put 46 episodes of filler into the show so by all means, don’t let me stop you. Anyway, they do a really good fight and just when I think they are going to take the show serious, we get the next episode where sadly, it feels like another filler! It is pretty much Mojo Jojo takes a holiday with the girl’s teacher, Miss Keane, who Mojo has a large crush on. Oh ya, I didn’t mention that in any this whole review, huh? That’s because it’s only touched like three times in the span of this show. Just like they only do one episode of where Mojo Jojo is ‘mother’ to the Rowdyruff Boys Z, the girl’s polar opposites. Then the boys vanish from sight till their next time they fight the girls. Every time you see Mojo’s ‘lair’ the boys are no where to be found so I have no clue where they live.Overall, if you want something that numbs your brain, this might be for you but I know for sure, I didn’t like it. It felt like I was watching something that was for a much younger audience even if some of the jokes were more adult. different (Thank god first off if it is) then I haven’t been able to see it.

And because it\'s based the Cartoon Network\'s Powerpuff Girls, I will compare them too.The CN\'s series was an attemt to make a japanese style cartoon in America (just look at it: chibi characters with big eyes, magical girl feeling - schoolgirls turn ito heroes - that\'s not typical in the US.)This series is a kind of ""We show you a real japanese PPG"". So the Aniplex  made a franzische with some modifications.First the changed the situation: to show it\'s an improvement of the US series, the Chemical X get...a new ingredient and becomes Chemical Z.Second: the girls get they power instead of they created by the professor. Also the girls are older now (not kindergarten aged, they go to school). The professor is less clumsy but he has a hasty son who makes up this shortage.As a typical magical girl anime, the girls have to transform. The robot pet Peach\'s voice needed to trigger the transformation. They have weapons too (that\'s also typical) - but less superpowers.Now the same things: the character names are the same as in the US series, each part is contains two episodes. Naturally the scene is changed to Tokyo.The music also confirm the feeling that this is an ""answer"" or parody of the US series: the used music styles give some american feeling. During Blossom\'s and Bubble\'s transformation we can hear two typical 70\'s, 80\'s disco beat and during Buttercup\'s transformation I waited Madonna to start singing ""Music"".

Instead of just stopping to a dubbed version for reasons that I only imagine being fan pleasing, Japan decided to have its own PPG series, made from scratch. And boy, did they change a lot…This is not exactly new in the industry. Since as far as the 80’s America and Japan make their own versions of the same story. Famous examples are Macross/Roboteck, American-only sequels to Voltron Defender...of the Universe, an American-only OVA conclusion to the Saber Rider and the Starsheriffs, several Japanese-only sequels and spin-offs to the Transformers. The thing is, all those shows were 90% identical or easily recognizable to be of the same franchise. PPGZ is way too different to PPGA to the point it feels as a different show. But I thought it was some what of a good show.ART (PPGA: 8, PPGZ: 5)PPGA was using a rather simple to draw and animate artwork which looked very 2-dimensional. It was also made to be a tribute to both the pop-art movement, superhero comic books of the 60’s, as well as a parody to several Japanese anime stereotypes. That made it look special and unique in a way, even if there are several series that were made the same way, like South Park, Dexter’s Laboratory or Ying Yang Yo. It was still somewhat different from the typical cartoon, which packs a lot more animation, 3D effects and lip-synch.PPGZ on the other hand looks way too typical. If you have watched several anime, you can easily see how average its animation is, with its jerky motions, frozen panels and repeating transformation clips. I’m pretty sure it costs more to create 3D effects and fluid animation but at the same time it looks far less captivating. It has no in-jokes to comic books and the anime jokes are not working that well, since mahou shoujo parodies are abundant in Japan but not in America.I don’t blame studio Toei for animating it like this, since it follows their recipe of how to make a nice children’s show to the letter. It’s just that it was too safe to be given to them and not to, let’s say GAINAX or SHAFT, which would definitely have done a lot more experimenting and would have produced a far more uncommon result.I think that was the only problem or thing I hated about this series.

Which had recieved an anime adaption in Japan.Story 8/10:It's a pretty enjoyable story which has maybe 1 or 2 episodes that fell flat from the rest. Powerpuff Girls Z is significantly different from the original PPG because story wise although there is a plot it tends to shift away from it for about 10-15 episodes and then decides to return to the real problem at hand which it kind've turns into a slice of life anime, but to completely disregard the plot and adding slice of life...just so that the story can get dragged out to last for a longer duration is not a good look. I loved how they knew exactly when and how to make the story threatening and create a certain level of suspense.Art 10/10:The character designs were executed beautifully and the Powerpuff Girls still kept their signature hairstyles, colours, eyes etc. Sedusa however changed drastically and for the worst, her character design really stood out to me due the fact that I could barely recognize her until she was introduced. The atmosphere was bright, bubbly and aesthetically pleasing.Characters 8/10:I would've given it a 10 but what happened to the RowdyRuff Boys? They went from being the PPG sworn enemies in the original but in the anime they are just annoying, spoilt little boys. The show had a ton of funny moments don't get me wrong but at times the comedy felt extremely forced. Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup had the same personalities and styles but their interests changed, honestly not much of a bother it was pretty fun with some interesting character development especially from Buttercup.Music 8/10:All the openings and endings were absolutely amazing. Reason behind losing 2 points was mainly caused by the fact that those are the only songs that stood out and their battle song, the rest of the songs were either forgettable or just down right basic.Voice acting 10/10:They did what needed to be done. There's no debate, the voice actors just delivered in the original japanese and english dub. (I watched the anime more than once in English and Japanese)Overall 10/10:Is what it deserves, watch the show because apparently unlike Powerpuff Girls (US), Powerpuff Girls Z doesn't appeal to everyone as much. just so that the story can get dragged out to last for a longer duration is not a good look.

A few scenes were reused a bit too much, excluding the transformations of course. While the story was tedious, overly goofy, and some episodes felt like barefaced copies of previous ones, it did manage to keep me amused. If it weren\'t for those more entertaining moments, though, it would have been a very ""meh"" series. The main attraction here is the immature playful comedy. I would suggest staying away from Powerpuff Girls Z if you are particularly critical with plot. (80% of the awesome...is in the last three episodes. That\'s a bit taxing in a fifty-two episode long series, no?) is in the last three episodes. That\'s a bit taxing in a fifty-two episode long series, no?)', 'So, me and my little sister (Me 13, she 5) watched this. After the first few episodes, my sister pretty much summed up the flaws.  The ppg powers are greatly reduced, (""I don\'t like how they can ONLY use yo-yo\'s and stuff)...also, the voices are horrible. This anime is ALOT like Sailor Moon, but with the ppg storyline. In Sailor Moon, I was forced to watch the subbed version, due to the fact that I couldn\'t STAND the voices. Same with this. My sister can\'t read, so she was forced to watch the dub, she also hated the voices.The characters a rewritten a bit;...Blossom is still the self appointed leader, but she\'s a bit boy crazy. She also doesn\'t enjoy doing homework as much, and moral stand\'s have dropped from the original Blossom.Buttercup is the most athletic girl in school, and is barely even a girl. She hates wearing skirts (Unfortunately, when they transform, they transform, short skirt is a big part of the costume...*cough* Sailor Moon *Cough*) But she\'s not THAT much different.Bubbles is the cute one. She is CONSTANTLY getting love letters and date requests, but she\'s also the dumb one. Go Figure.If you hated Sailor Moon (Like me) then you MIGHT hate this...I recommend watching the first 3 episodes, then judging for yourself. If your a ppg fan, this is definitely a step down, but it is most certainly a step up from Sailor Moon.Wish you the best, In your Anime Quest ^.^-Drumming1997 Blossom is still the self appointed leader, but she\'s a bit boy crazy.

Clearly the writers weren\'t taking it seriously. But seeing as this has the beloved cartoon\'s name attached to it, of course it\'s going to receive a lot of hate. The point is, I think that if the producers wanted to make a joke series, they shouldn\'t do it with an already existing franchise that lots of people love.Story: 4/10Where do I begin? I\'m not going to pretend that anything made sense; like I said, if I turn off my very logical mathematical mind...I can follow this about as much as I can follow a lesson on adding apples and oranges. A.K.A. You simply don\'t. You sit back and watch. With the exception of a feel mediocre add-ins like Takaaki and Miko, the last four or so episodes is the only point that anything begins happening. And even then not any of it gives off a feeling of being preplanned past a couple previously seen fan service shots of an Edo era PPG. If I completely abandon the idea that any form of structural writing went into it, it becomes a simply decent storyline about black and white lights terrorizing the city. So I gave it the \'decent\' rating.Art: 3/10Now with a 95% chance of a derp shot with every episode. You can tell Toei made this. The recycled animation shots aren\'t nearly as abundant as the final season of Pokémon BW, but whenever we do get new content the characters almost always look like they just came out of a broken washing machine that squirts out the mutagen from TMNT. This is sadly disappointing as there are moments where the show is genuinely well (not outstandingly) animated. Some examples include the opening and ending songs, the final few episodes, the transformation sequences, and the few and far in between darker toned plots. The design of the characters are sub-par at best and leeches off the creativity that the original had. With the exception of possibly Princess, these ""brand new"" designs actually dull the initial quirkiness the old ones had down. You never want a show called Powerpuff Girls to do that.Sound: 9/10The music is quite literally the best part of the show. What a loss it is that the dub cut out the original openings and endings as those were the only real parts I can still to this day show to friends in hopes of getting them into anime. One grip I have with them here is the blatant last second edit of the second opening that showcased how disorganized this entire series was. They weren\'t even bothered to spend a few minutes shading Momoko in until a couple episodes after the opening originally released. It\'s this pure laziness that is a shame also transverses into the one strongest saving graces of this show.There is also the issue of misconception. The openings, endings, and some OST\'s give off the perfect vibe of friendship, coming of age, and happiness in a way that the show itself never fully reaches. I\'ve heard countless comments how if only the show were as touching as the OST it was gifted with. And seeing feedback that the series itself felt detached from the music is never a good thing.Characters: 6/10-2 for Momoko freaking Akatsutsumi. Anime is great, it\'s one of my passions to watch. But she\'s one prime example of how it can also be an awful abomination. They changed everything that made her character in the original: her leadership, her intelligence, quick wit, and ability to get the other girls to listen to her, just for the sake of catering to the moe ditzy love obsessed audience. She does have moments where her quick thinking is what saves the day, but ultimately the poor execution and lack of character development makes those moments become a complete one-time lucky break more than anything. Miyako is slightly infuriating at first but her complete detachment from real life soon becomes a character trait that you can at least appreciate for being consistent. Kaoru is probably the least damaged out of all the girls; and she brings some of the funniest moments. So what\'s going on? Shouldn\'t the score be higher?Looking past what the characters are like in the first few episodes, the fact is that none of them. Ever. Change. There were attempts to explore Momoko and Miyako\'s characters by introducing love interests (though short-lived in Momoko\'s case) for them. But while Momoko\'s lack of taking anything seriously ruined her chance, Miyako\'s lack of any real conclusion past, you guessed it, the fourth ending song, completely derails whatever chance at developing they have into a mud hole. Kaoru\'s probably the only character I don\'t mind too much didn\'t change as she was the most solid thing in this series, but having something be average just doesn\'t cut it anymore. I would score this lower if the friendship between the three wasn\'t downright heartwarming at times.Enjoyment: 8/10Myself, I was part of the entourage which tuned in week after week, with PPG Z wallpapers and avatars littering my every being. Having something be your muse for a while doesn\'t boost how good the show actually is; so my enjoyment unfortunately doesn\'t affect my final score much. But hey, if it can get some people into it, it must have SOMETHING, right? Once you get past the dubbing down and utter embarrassment this can be to the original, it does become a fun show to follow every Saturday morning.Overall: 6/10Watch this show if you\'re looking to kill some time, or possibly want to sit through a couple nice tracks playing through a train wreck of a series. That\'s really it. If you\'re a fan of the original, I think it\'s more likely you\'ll end up hating it than loving it. But since there\'s a chance you won\'t hate it, then give it a shot.

I was already a huge PPG fan during my early childhood, so watching this series was so much fun. Years later, it has aged. I still have an appreciation for it.If you’re already a fan of the original series, you’ll enjoy it just fine. It’s not perfect, but it’s durable. Be mindful of some of the changes made in the anime (the girls not being related is a prime example and are 13 instead of 5.

I never watched the original Powerpuff girls as a kid the way that my friends did, and instead I grew up on... this. It's what probably introduced me to anime and what bonded my older sister and I- hours in front of the phone watching this show. I also remember watching it dubbed, and from my vague childhood memory it wasn't that bad.In this review I can't...exactly comment on comparisons to the original Powerpuff Girls, as I have no experience with it. However, several years and about a thousand anime episodes later, I have more experience with the field of anime in general.It's pretty much a magical girl show. Three girls are hit with a chemical that suddenly give them... new outfits and superpowers, I guess. They have to hide their secret double life while attending school and saving the world. There's even transformation sequences to boot. The best word to describe it is fun. It's really, really, fun. If you can suspend your disbelief for a while to watch this zany magical girl anime rendition of a classic, you won't regret it. Powerpuff Girls Z is objectively and technically not amazing, but absolutely positively a good time. exactly comment on comparisons to the original Powerpuff Girls, as I have no experience with it.

However the story itself is nicely done however not faithful to the original story at all, but has many potential to continue the story in manga, even if the anime itself gained far from enough popularity than expected from the English and other asian Cartoon Network channels from the 2000s. The artstyle tastes simple and touches Scott Pilgrim in many ways. The transformation of the girls were pretty much unnecessary and...Mojo's height is disturbing. The rest of the villains look okay and still faithful to the original CN version. The story is enjoyable and tries to remain as family friendly as possible which deserves to be watched by kids unlike the CN version which has really brutal and disgusting episodes. I actually managed to have a different type of Powerpuff girls I really wished for even if I cannot highlight most things about it as it's as average as possible. Glad PPGZ eventually happened to customize the anime arsenal even more for it's release and the lenght of the series is healthy on top of that.

I got bored after the first two episodes and resigned to the rest of the series being ""background noise"" while working.The only thing I can compliment is the art style.

Powerpuff Girls Z.There were some changes to the anime that actually more sense than they did in the original.In the anime the girls and the monsters they fight have an origin story that makes more sense than in the original where the girls are humans created by a mix of Chemical X with random ingredients that were suppose to create the perfect girls. The monsters the girls fight in the anime have also an origin story rather than just the lazy writing that monsters exist in...that world.Demashita! Powerpuff Girls Z has a continuous story and the episodes are more connected than the original which allows the anime to build the world and introduce and develop the characters.For the magic girl genre to make more sense they aged up the girls and made them attend school rather than have kindergarten kids fight monsters. Also since nobody is suppose to know who the Powerpuff Girls Z are they have to keep their identity secret.The anime has comedy, action and some mild drama. It is also a lot less violent compared to the original given this anime is for a younger audience and is suppose to be more appealing to the female demographic rather than the male demographic.The OPs and EDs and the music during the transformations are nice.I personally enjoyed this more than the original and I hope someday they'll continue or restart this anime with newer animation. that world.Demashita!

I\'ll be blunt; this is one of the most appalling pieces of shit that I\'ve ever seen. To pass this off as the result of adaptations in shows typically going wrong would be the understatement of the entire series, as this show has gone out of its way to be sadistic and torture its audience as much as possible. One forum commenter also apparently agreed, stating it took them two years to finish and they only did it for nostalgia and the soundtrack. (this poor poor soul....) The show\'s ""overarching plot,"" if you will, is so loosely tied together that...at a glance it seems completely random with no elements of foresight whatsoever. The reason for this is likely due to the overwhelming monster of the day element; Him releasing the black particles would be fine as a normal monster of the day element. To use it as an excuse to have the EXACT SAME PLOT for more than 80% of the series (This was happening ever since the villain after Mojo was introduced) is completely inexcusable, especially considering the lack of any sort of lore or buildup the show would\'ve been able to have. Aside from their relevance to the lore, the Chakichaki girls are COMPLETELY irrelevant and serve almost no purpose in the entire story whatsoever; the same can be said for the American PPG cameos, although they actually were only on-screen for less than 1/4 of a second flying into the air. This ruins the entire point of the Easter egg by COMPLETELY denying the viewer any interaction with them, let alone SEEING them outside of glowing colorful trails. At least the when AMERICAN Powerpuff Girls included crossovers (to other shows, namely Dexter\'s Lab) they at least had the courtesy to SHOW the characters on-screen outside of a blur. The show also features an overwhelmingly aggressive amount of abuse towards Mojo that surges to uncomfortable moments where it\'s clear someone on the writing staff absolutely hated Mojo and wanted to abuse him as much as possible, as seen when they try to rob him of as many moments as they can get away with. Nearly every character on this show has been written in such a way that they were even more unlikable than the American version. The Powerpuff Girls Z themselves suffer from overwhelmingly poor characterization which results in character moments that come off as UNBELIEVABLY forced and stiff especially when coming from the original series for reference. This wouldn\'t be a problem if this was an ADAPTATION, meaning anyone here is AUTOMATICALLY from the American series by default and knows how these girls should be acting and behaving, and the like for the villains. I could rant about this show and everything wrong with it for hours, but instead I will leave you with some memories of the worst episodes by far of the entire show; a dung beetle falling in love with a female dung beetle (who almost dies in a single episode), a bowl of ramen wanting to correct everyone for not eating ramen ""properly,"" Buttercup not just falling in love with a man because he\'s handsome, but becoming willing to change her entire personality and wear girly skirts and dresses just because of this, the Powerpuff Girls literally abusing Mojo when he\'s sick in the hospital...these are a FEW OF THE HORRID, NUMEROUS MOMENTS IN THE SERIES. This series has been incredibly painful and under no circumstances would I recommend watching this show unless you have a masochistic tendency to watch your favorite characters be completely dismantled and worn down into hated versions of those of whom you\'ve known. Another example would be Miss Keane, who I have an intense aversion towards now; due to her abusive behavior towards Mojo, I\'m unable to find myself liking her, at least in this version. I\'ll need to cut it short here but in essence: NEVER watch this show whatsoever, unless you have severe masochism for ruining your childhood.

Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9493/Dororon_Enma-kun_Meeramera,"['\'Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera\' is a gag anime based on \'70s manga with a LOT of ecchi elements. As a result, the humor is mostly driven by classic manga or anime references, ecchi jokes like girls getting stripped naked in most implausible ways, guys getting poked in the ass, or dirty jokes. The comedy style is very Japanese, with persistent running jokes and oyaji-gag (pun-heavy, old fashioned jokes).The art in the show has a nostalgic style, with retro character designs. For the most part, this show seems like it could\'ve been made in the \'70s, but the battle scenes are ridiculously detailed and serious that you...know it was done on purpose for laughs, and find it funny.OP/ED are also designed to be funny, with OP having obviously outdated tune that was popular in the \'70s anime songs, with matching voice that was far too serious for the series. The ED has an absurdly inappropriate lyric that keeps repeating ""someday we\'ll all drop dead"" in a song sang in lullaby style.The voice acting was excellent, with all the character sounding very unique, yet fits perfectly for each role. The biggest surprise was the guest appearance of Nozawa Masako (who also went on to voice Gokuu in \'DBZ\' and Doraemon) and Sakai Sumie, the seiyuu for Enma and Yukiko in the original series in final episode.\'Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera\' is one of the few anime series that successfully pulled off ""so bad it\'s actually good"" because it pokes fun at the \'70s in every single aspect of the anime, which is essentially making fun of itself.Final episode was truly epic, with plenty of seizure-inducing visual troll going on. But on the other hand, brings closure to the story while solving all the unexplained plot devices, and makes good use of opening narration for every single episode ""I will never forget the heroes who came from Hell.""The story also makes reference to many \'70s events such as the Osaka Expo and the Vietnam War. This makes it a very difficult series for most viewers, since it is based on a kids show, but kids today won\'t possibly get the references. The art style has the retro feel, but older viewers may be turned off by excessive ecchi and \'Crayon Shin-chan\' level jokes. \'Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera\' is a very very niche anime that 90% of you will not enjoy, but it\'s a gem for those who actually ""get it"".

In terms of retro gag anime, this is as good as it gets.', 'Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera is a mostly nonsensical and perverted romp involving Enma-kun and the Youkai Patrol dealing with random demons dealing silly and sometimes perverted hijinks on humanity. The plot is pretty bare-bones where throughout much of the first half, Enma and his group deal with a random demon each episode and the second half explores the group discovering who is behind the string of demons being let loose from hell. If you are expecting consistent plot and character development throughout this series, then you will be quite disappointed as Dororon Enma-kun is more focused on its crazy and perverse comedy than giving you a...serious plot to stick with.However if you are looking for a comedy title, Enma-kun does more than enough to deliver on its laughs for the most part. The show is quite manic in its pacing with the over-the-top behavior delivered from main character Enma-kun and various other characters that the demon kid encounters. Enma doesn\'t come off as your typical hero as he is impulsive, dense, perverted to the point where he attempts to molest fellow Youkai Patrol member Yukiko any chance he gets and has no qualms at inflicting overkill on his foes. And rather than inflict fear and pain upon the human populace, the demons encountered by the Youkai Patrol in most instances are more focused on having the populace be in various embarrassing predicaments such as making them brainless or fat. The show was also not afraid to make nods to aspects of popular culture and breaking the fourth wall as there are parodies of creator Go Nagai\'s earlier works like Cutey Honey and Mazinger Z. However, the comedy does miss its mark on some occasions as some episodes have the annoying habit of focusing on a running gag throughout in response to whichever threat the Youkai Patrol faces in an episode.The major aspect of the series that will make or break your enjoyment for it if you dig comedy would be the heavy emphasis on perverted humor. From what I understand, a number of Go Nagai\'s works are quite infamous for pushing the envelope when it comes to violent and sexual content. In the case of Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera, it has a great amount of the former. The perversion of the series appears to be a blatant ""take that"" in response to Tokyo Prefecture\'s recent passing of its controversial Bill 156. Examples of what you can expect out of the show\'s perversion include Yukiko regularly being just about nude as her clothes are shredded apart from demon attacks, Enma-kun trying to sneak in opportunities to molest Yukiko and a demon in the first episode who attacks the Youkai Patrol literally with um... a certain body part that will remain nameless. If you can\'t dig rampant sexual humor in your anime, then this isn\'t a show you will be willing to see.In terms of presentation, Dororon Enma-kun does come across as rather average. The show\'s animation style takes on an older look as a number of character designs look simple and have ridiculously-proportioned body parts (Enma\'s father being of great example) seeming to be a clear homage to older Go Nagai works. It appears the animation budget to this series wasn\'t too big judging from the number of reused animation frames and shortcuts used within action scenes, a low point compared to better-looking titles of the Spring 2011 anime season like Hanasaku Iroha and C. In terms of the show\'s soundtrack, only the show\'s intense rock OP stuck out for me with other musical tracks serving their part in accompanying the show\'s manic and perverse humor yet not being too memorable.Overall, Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera\'s manic and perverse humor was surprisingly effective at most points of getting laughs out of me thanks to the antics of its characters, parodies of Go Nagai early works and other crazy elements. The perverse humor won\'t be for everyone and it does have its moments of its humor losing effect thanks to relying on running gags.

But this did well as my comedy title of choice for the Spring 2011 anime season despite its shortcomings.', 'Overall from what I have read after having been assaulted by this rancid piece of crap that unfortunately was given the title of entertainment I can understand that there is a lot of history that went behind the show. That however to me does not excuse how inexplicably bad the show was nor does it evoke a sense of sympathy in me that maybe I should not judge it by the standards of what a good comedy show should be. So without further I do I now review.Story- If the story was supposed to be treated like an action show with any hint of seriousness...in it it would have been an utter failure from the start. While the idea of a spirit squad sent from the underworld to protect mankind from the evil yokai trying to invade the world can make a great plot, as has been proven to me by many great anime released in history, in this story line it seemed less like a plot to get behind and more like a second thought by the writers. I will say this loud and clear in that I felt in almost no way whatsoever did the ""heroes"" do their jobs in a satisfactory manor which is to say that the heroes were not heroes and that the enemies that they were fighting were more like an excuse for Enma to just prove that he was incompetent and destroy stuff. I keep in mind though that this show was not meant to be a serious action show but a humorous show to get a few chuckles out of, this series however could not make me laugh. Quite frankly it was way too raunchy for me to have ever suggested little kids watching it but at the same time when the humor wasn\'t incredibly dry witted or just down right appalling it seemed to be aimed at an audience with the mental standings of a child, the history behind the show explains this but even so in modern society this sends out a confusing message to the audience of who exactly the target audience for this show is. When I get into the actual plot and driving force of this show...it is broken and thrown together with some back hint of an overarching plot that is ridiculously used to tie everything together in the end in a way that was generally displeasing to watch. The episodes don\'t really feel connected, which while this works for some shows, did not work for this one at all and quite frankly made a difficult show to watch even more difficult to sit down and finish. This is why I am giving the story a 3 I can see that there was effort put into it but because everything feels thrown together and the story is truly not done in such a way as to make it interesting I cannot give this story a high rating.Art- I can appreciate old style art work and character stereotypes but there was something that just gritted me ever so slightly about the way this series was drawn. I attribute this mostly to the fact that I felt Enma was drawn a bit to feminine and while I don\'t expect the main male lead to be a macho man body builder I can find very few qualities about Enma except for his very forced masculine personality that want me to believe what I am looking at is the male lead of the show. I don\'t mind being called a bit overcritical on this but I feel I really just had to say what I was feeling. A 5 felt right to me because once again while I didn\'t hate the art it just kind of gritted my nerves.Sound- Funny enough I felt the sounds in the show were done well and while I may not have chosen somebody with such an annoying high pitched voice to play the already feminine looking lead for the show, I can say that the their choice of vocal cast for the show was at least able to keep me from dropping series from inability to withstand a constant assault on my eardrums.Character- I apologize in advance, words cannot describe my utter hatred for the characters in the show. Quite literally most characters had the personality of a brick wall with their emotions painted in graffiti on them and any hint of deeper emotion was either buried in a pit so deep it makes the abyss looks like a tall sunflower growing in the summer garden or so shallow it made could make airplanes look like low-flying kites by comparison.Enjoyment- This was a very rough show, it was challenging for me to complete and several times I contemplated dropping it altogether but I pulled through because I wanted to see how it ended, but with such a unflattering ending and barrage of excruciatingly bad jokes to fall on this series got the one it deserved from me for an enjoyment.Overall- I have to say that I didn\'t like this series it was not entertaining, not eventful, and honestly painful to watch. Perhaps if you come into the show with an understanding of the history behind it before you watch it could be considered funny but from what I felt I don\'t think this will be most people\'s cup of tea to go with their cake so much as their glass a vinegar to wash down a soggy biscuit. in it it would have been an utter failure from the start.

And most of the content and structure stems from that period.As a gag/ecchi anime/manga DEM certainly displays the mediums juvenile tendencies in its fullest, the good and the bad.The best thing about this anime is probably the structure and artwork. For most of the time the art is stylized in a constant quality, if necessary. But most of the time it has a decent animation over the whole run.The structure is similar. It starts with a monster-of-the-week approach, but as more characters are introduced, the higher the stakes become...and the mystery about the attacks of the weekly monsters become more apparent.However, this is where the good things end. By far the weakest link of the series is its comedy. It is 70's. In that era vulgar displays of nudity and genital humor were considered funny. But, 40 years later for the anime release and 50 years by time of writing this, it no longer is considered funny in that region as more nuanced humor was established culturally. The internet changed a lot in that regard and while I don't blame it for this downside, it certainly changed the perception of what is acceptable and what not. Still, these differences are still within different countries as their culture is still a part of what is and is not funny or engaging.And while some might think that having a penis sword in the first episode might be considered as rude by some, I merely considered it as something weird but ultimately a skill the demon has, even when it isn't practical in any sense.And this carries through the whole series. As someone who wants to enjoy stories on a more nuanced I certainly am not part of the target demographic of this series and thus not really qualified to talk about subjective experiences of comedy.However, and this is a big one, certain aspects and sexual comedy has universally changed through most of the modern countries. In this anime, there were multiple jokes involving rape and zoophilia/bestiality. And these points made it clear for me that this anime shouldn't have been produced in the modern time, or at least changed for these points.Other than that most jokes border on the lines between fine, boring by repetition or boring by duration. For me there were no outbursts of laughter in none of the episodes.In regards to the characters, there isn't much to talk about. All of them fall into certain stereotypes to facilitate the comedy. Pervert protagonist, love interest by being opposite, slapstick character, wisecrack and fish-out-of-water. They all have their contrivances and while they bring different aspects and viewpoints to different scenes, they still all fall in the predictable section.In total Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera falls flat through outdated humor whose comedy has fallen out of favor of the modern times and would mostly be regarded as something that exists. Most of the jokes are predictable through the stereotypes the characters portray, but some jokes are, while not offensive, have simply aged very, very badly. Comedy certainly is subjective in many regards and one has to be in the mood for the comedy to be allowed to make an impression. As someone who isn't the target audience, and doesn't even want to be, it didn't resonate with me at all. and the mystery about the attacks of the weekly monsters become more apparent.However, this is where the good things end.

Dynamic Super Robots Soushingekki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12885/Dynamic_Super_Robots_Soushingekki,"[""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI will lead that I have a great love for the classic super robots genre and this series craters directly to that. Unfortunately, it really has nothing to offer to anyone else outside of that.This very short run series was intended as a showcase of the different Go Nagai super robot shows with a special introduction of a new robot at the end and provides no real substance beyond that.The story is a typical heroes rescue a damsal in distress so there is nothing special here. Unfortunately, it does end in a cliff hanger which is a real shame as it could...have easily been wrapped up with 1 more short episode. Had it also included a quick prequel episode leading up to the first as well would have made it a much more complete series.There are no voice overs in it, only the music and sound effects.While dialog was likely left out due to budget, I think found it to be for the best as any dialog would have distracted away from the action and music.The sound effects are very close to what might be recalled from each of the original shows for each robot.The music is basically a collage of the intro theme songs for each of the robots with the songs jumping about as each new one is introduced. Given the patchwork nature of that, I found it to work well.While all the character images were spot on, the overall animation art I found lacking. While decent, the budget constraints clearly showed.As a fan of the genre and someone familiar with most of the shows, this short series brought a Marvel's Avengers moment to all those classic characters finally getting together. For that reason alone, dispite its other shortcomings, loved it.Finally, for those unfamiliar with the characters, as most are 40+ years old now and somewhat obscure, the following is a list of the shows (not characters) that provide cameos:Mazinger ZGreat MazingerMazinkaiserGod MazingerUFO Robot GrendizerGetter Robo GShin Getter RoboSteel JeegPsycho Armor GovarianGroizer X have easily been wrapped up with 1 more short episode.

Fushigi no Umi no Nadia Omake Gekijou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3381/Fushigi_no_Umi_no_Nadia_Omake_Gekijou,"[""The Nadia Omakes are little extras that were made after the &quot;Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water TV series, and should satisfy fans of the show.There really is no story to these Omakes as expected, and each 4 minute segment is pretty much a small skit (most of which are Comedy driven) that deals with more in depth info on the characters and episodes from the show. They are quite entertaining, and give good info at the same time. If you are a fan of the TV series then these are nice little extras to add to your viewings. The skits certainly aren&rsquo;t really anything...special, and are mostly there as Easter Eggs for the fans. But the things you will learn about include: more info on the Nautolis, what some characters were doing when off screen, to just giving more background story on a certain cast member. It&rsquo;s a nice little extra because as fans probably know, the TV series wasn&rsquo;t really much of a comedy...so something like this is a nice change of pace. Not a whole lot of depth to the skits, but pretty enjoyable none the less.The music to these Omakes is pretty forgettable, and the only real memorable parts comes in the form of the opening instrumental--which contains a lot of horns! It's okay and all, it's just a shame it couldn't include any vocals. The best part about the audio is that the Japanese voice cast all return to fill their roles.Oddly enough the art seems to look a bit more on the aged side when compared to the series, which aired in the late 80&rsquo;s. Of course it could be because ADV licensed the Nadia series and the movie...yet never brought over these Omakes. So yeah...All the characters have there personality from the show; from Nadia&rsquo;s out spoken ways, to Jean&rsquo;s curiosity, to Captain Nemo&rsquo;s quiet demeanor. (Does that name sound familiar? Yes, Nadia&rsquo;s story is actually based on Jules Verne&rsquo;s &quot;1000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;) Since these shorts are more about comedy, it&rsquo;s interesting to note that all the characters are drawn much more chibi this time around, though still do show up in their mature figures as well.If you are a fan of Nadia (or are interested in the TV series), then I recommend checking these out. Though I feel I should warn you, that these Omakes give good detail on the plot from the series, and thus contain a large amount of spoilers. So if you haven&rsquo;t seen the series, then you should do so first before watching these.Side Note: The Nadia franchise should be viewed in the following order:1. TV series2. Omakes3. Movie special, and are mostly there as Easter Eggs for the fans. But the things you will learn about include: more info on the Nautolis, what some characters were doing when off screen, to just giving more background story on a certain cast member. It&rsquo;s a nice little extra because as fans probably know, the TV series wasn&rsquo;t really much of a comedy...so something like this is a nice change of pace. Not a whole lot of depth to the skits, but pretty enjoyable none the less.The music to these Omakes is pretty forgettable, and the only real memorable parts comes in the form of the opening instrumental--which contains a lot of horns! It's okay and all, it's just a shame it couldn't include any vocals. The best part about the audio is that the Japanese voice cast all return to fill their roles.Oddly enough the art seems to look a bit more on the aged side when compared to the series, which aired in the late 80&rsquo;s. Of course it could be because ADV licensed the Nadia series and the movie...yet never brought over these Omakes. So yeah...All the characters have there personality from the show; from Nadia&rsquo;s out spoken ways, to Jean&rsquo;s curiosity, to Captain Nemo&rsquo;s quiet demeanor.

Gangsta. Recap,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31561/Gangsta_Recap,"[""Considering Gansgta is a difficult series to understand, this recap came in a good time.It explains the families and the game of powers in Ergastulum, shows the origins and ranks of the Twilights (according to what has been shown until episode 9) and delineates the functions (and sometimes backstories) of almost all characters.The only flaw of this special was the lack of a properly explanation of all the events from the latest episodes...If your are having trouble with Gangsta's sometimes complicated plot, I recommend this. Don't watch it if you are ok with the plot; you may become bored. "", ""Sometimes you need a recap episode to remind the viewers of the important things from the past episodes that they might have forgotten by now. Gangsta 9.5 is a recap episode that serves no purpose to exist.The recap mainly focuses in the beginning of the show (episodes 1-2), then a little bit of the middle episodes and the latest episodes. (episodes 5-9). It also gives a summary of EVERY character. No, I'm serious. Even the old woman that sells Worick his cigarettes gets a bit of information.This recap is completely pointless and boring as all hell to watch. It feels like you're watching a...guy narrate the 9 episodes you have already watched (or are supposed to), but it's so utterly bland that you just don't care for what is being told to you.Take Kekkai Sensen's recap episode for example. The reason I liked that recap episode was because it was fun and entertaining to watch by the fact that they were self aware that it was a recap episode. You can see the effort put into that, unlike Gangsta's recap episode, that only goes way too in depth about things that you probably don't need to know.Should you watch Gangsta's recap episode? No. Only if you watched the show half asleep and you don't know what's going on. But you'll probably fall asleep while watching this recap if that's the case. 3/10. guy narrate the 9 episodes you have already watched (or are supposed to), but it's so utterly bland that you just don't care for what is being told to you.Take Kekkai Sensen's recap episode for example.

Gangsta. Recap; also called episode 9.5, came with the mindset of acting against those claims and making it a bit easier on the memory to process everything that has happened so far. Just like what “91 Days” did, it was a brief look on the first 9 episodes of the main series to give more clarification on certain...characters, and explain their connection in a more narrative way.- Story (6.5/10):Talking here about how the recap handled the retelling of the story, and not on the main strong progression. This honestly felt like a very short episode although sharing the same length with the others, the information presented kept consistent, in a more linear way, they went from introducing every character out there to presenting each faction's motives and hinting at their intentions. In term of the story itself, there wasn't much to praise, I would actually argue this was more of a character centered episode than showing actual events.- Art (9/10):How I love the art style in this one, it suits the crime genre a whole lot, the gore was just on point, you don't see people splashing fountains of blood when cut or anything. The fight scenes are always very exciting even if they are not major battles. I just love the anatomy and faces expressions. 95% of the animations where clips reused from older episodes, but why I'm going to complain when they looked so good either way.- Sound (7.5/10):The voice acting was just spot on, Nicolas deprecated voice sounds so realistic and in character, Alex actually sounds like a desperate ex-prostitute with more on her mind than she actually lets out. The ending and opening theme songs that they kept from the main story were above average to very good.- Character (7/10):The main trio are all likable in their own way, Nicolas, as a deaf ice-cold killing machine that has gone through a lot than my tears can hold for was always a source of sympathy, the lost soul of Alex, as someone who has nowhere to go made it easier for us, the viewers, to understand her sadness. And then there is the guy who ties them all up together, Worick, a guy too kind for their cruel world. In this recap, they went through reminding us of the major plot points consisting those three, and even went ahead and talked about the cop duo, Dr. Theo and his assistance, all of the known four fathers members and leaders, and even the Tabacco shop clerk, the granny and her granddaughter. I feel like they should have gone deeper with the characters and picking on stuff in their past, but looking at the limited length of the episode, I can close an eye on that.- Enjoyment (7.0/10):For me as someone who didn't binge watch this show, the recap was a vital decision that refreshed a whole lot of information that I either slept off on or forgot. Seeing how we're closing to the end of the series, it would be good to have as much awareness of the story as possible.- Overall (7.4/10):If you're already fully concentrated and following the story with a great face, being it a binge watch or not, you won't really miss out much on this recap, but in case you really are lost and confused about all sort of aspects of the show, this one was just a splendid reminder of so many things, like going as far as redefining what a Twilight means, what's the Celebrer drug and so on. characters, and explain their connection in a more narrative way.- Story (6.5/10):Talking here about how the recap handled the retelling of the story, and not on the main strong progression.
