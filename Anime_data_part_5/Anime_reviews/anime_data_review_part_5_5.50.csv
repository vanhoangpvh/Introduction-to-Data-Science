Himeyuri,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20469/Himeyuri,"['Like a great iconic game\'s slogen says: ""War... War never changes."" Really, it doesn\'t. It doesn\'t change much on the matters if it takes place in the Napoleon Era, in the Ancient Egypt, in the modern days or the World War II. In war time, not only the soldiers suffered with the heavy losses and femine. The civilians were too, but since the citizenship, the socialist ideas it became more emphased if the civilians were suffering. I don\'t have to tell anything really any particular about the World War I, the national independence wars or even about the World War II. There are iconic movies...about these, showing us the lifestyle in those days both in good way and bad way.Concerning this in an anime, it becomes more interesting. We have two great titles about the World War II\'s inhumanity: Hotaru no Haka and Hadashi no Gen. Both are great in story, and in art too but they are just only plainly based on a true story with much screenwriting creativity. The real issue is, we still don\'t really have any shocking title if it comes to biographic historical anime. They are not just rare, but super rare. One of these titles is Himeyuri.Well, as you can fell, why does the story gets it\'s 9 point. It\'s shocking like those two that I mentioned earlier, but also giving us a piece of cake. And the cake is the Battle of Okinawa. Many documentary adapted it, but none of them ever mentioned the Himeyuri Academy, which was originally consisted two school. The Himeyuri tells the story of it\'s students and teachers from preparing the island for a siege until the American surveillance, and a bit after the war until the Himeyuri Peace Museum has been built (in 1989). And to be frank, I like narrative documentaries...The art is just fair, deserves 6 points. Mostly it represents how the youth see the world and therefore I told you why did they animated it with still pictures, painted out with crayon. Most people maybe won\'t like this resolution, but any other else I presume wouldn\'t look this good and this authentic.The sounds are good. It deserves a 7 for the narrator\'s voice and her way to tell the story. Sometimes I felt her voice gripping on my neck, when it came to those moments, when you could smell inhumanity in the air. Both from other actions, both from the situations. Other way, there\'s nothing really much else.Characters. Now they deserve a 6, which is a fair point concerning the fact, this is a documentary. There won\'t be any development in the characters, they are just there, even the narrator itself. They are just serving their purpose. No names, just relations. It would be a simple 5 points, as an average, but +1 is given for this perfectly solved matter.Enjoyment. Now, those who didn\'t liked the Hotaru no Haka or the Hadashi no Gen, just stay away away from this too. They won\'t like this either. The really enjoyment of this concerns those who liked this two titles, and also likes documentary movies, and not even a bit afraid from the unusual art form of this picture drama. I rated this part of it with 10 points.Overall it became 8 points. I think this is one very good short movie about the topic itself. Everybody should now consider: is it really worth to watch this? Well, to be exact: you have nothing to loose. Don\'t expect fun, don\'t expect boobs, don\'t expect guro or anything else, that is really popular and fun. Sometimes learning something is the real fun itself.

High School Mystery: Gakuen Nanafushigi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9882/High_School_Mystery__Gakuen_Nanafushigi,"['Hello everyone! This is the first review of this VERY underated horror anime, and sadly so, because this is a great horror show, it has a great atmosphere and that feel of danger in each episode, you connect really well with the characters. I have watched a good amount of horror anime and i can say this is a very good one, especially for its time, in the 80´s and 90´s it was really hard to stand out, because great animes of that genre were coming, and if something stood out, it is because it was good, sadly it was overshadowed by bigger releases here...in the overseas, so this never left japan, and that is the only ""problem"" i had, becuase you will have to watch the raws of it, no fansub in spanish, english or brazilian portuguese (the only languages i can fully understand, but, i also didnt find anything in italian or french, let alone german.), the raws are in the internet so you can watch it, but, have in mind that it is a raw, so you need to know one thing or two. The plot is simple and direct, but doesnt fall into the boring or dumb class, it is actually a great horror plot in a school setting, but, due to it being very focused on telling the story through the psychological horror of the chars reacting to the atmosphere, if you understand a bit of japanese you will be able to keep up just fine.The story start with a suicide from some girl that was kinda bullied and left behind by the class president, and after the suicide the girl who is the president of the class starts to dish and say that she was useless and her death was just life, people die everyday and the school shouldn\'t stop because of a simple mediocre student who died, then our heroin, the main character jumps in to calm things down and put the president on her place saying we should respect the family loss and stuff about how we need to respect the dead ones, but them, the story really starts when the spirit of the girl starts to shake the vase that was put in her table as a sign of respect, the class gets scared and this is were it all begins, i wont tell anything more because it would be a spoiler, and this series is sooo good, please check it out brothers and sisters ! in the overseas, so this never left japan, and that is the only ""problem"" i had, becuase you will have to watch the raws of it, no fansub in spanish, english or brazilian portuguese (the only languages i can fully understand, but, i also didnt find anything in italian or french, let alone german.), the raws are in the internet so you can watch it, but, have in mind that it is a raw, so you need to know one thing or two.

Hakushaku to Yousei Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7083/Hakushaku_to_Yousei_Specials,"['Hakushaku to Yousei (Early and Fairy) Specials - a picture drama where the characters recite lines from Shakespeare poems. The poetic lines are recited using Old English terms like ""thine"" and ""thee"".Imagine sitting through literature class deciphering the intricate meanings behind every line of Shakespeare\'s poems. A dictionary needs to be rested in the audience\'s hands that cracks the Old English terms into the modern day language. Even the subtitles and captions are written in Old English. It confused me greatly. There\'s no substantial plot. It\'s more of a poetry recital. I\'m also not in the mood to crack each poetic line to decipher the...meaning behind Shakespeare\'s words.The only perk of watching this anime was listening to the beautiful and traditional classical music that roams in the background. Old English poetry recitals are not my cup of tea. It will remind me of classical school plays where they recite words off written poems (either memorized or looking at a script or note cards). meaning behind Shakespeare\'s words.The only perk of watching this anime was listening to the beautiful and traditional classical music that roams in the background.

Pretty interesting concept for a short, but I\'d wondered for an original series, it would have been nice to see this fleshed as a normal 12-episode series, given that the characters, aside from main MCs Minato and Chikako\'s journey of trials and tribulations, along with their own personal fears that make the whole voice acting job feel pressured and...looked upon by society standards. Both MCs interactions in getting over their fears, such as taking that 1st step into voice acting are decent. Nothing groundbreaking but passable.Signal.MD\'s artwork and animation still shines, albeit decently. This is not their ""MMO Junkie"" level of expertise, so take everything you see with a grain of salt. And of course, the music. What\'s music like when you add in the well-known HoneyWorks label? Good and well-rounded music, that\'s their forte, though I wish that they would stick to female groups instead of male groups (as evidently pointed out by the ED being better than the OP IMO). Sexism? Oh hell no.In the end, this is just meh and pretty much a bare-bones (if you ask me). Nothing exciting fills you up than having to know how voice acting is done in Japan, I guess.

Then Hashiri Tsuzukete Yokattatte (I\'m glad I could keep running) is the right anime for you!This anime is about two aspiring voice actor and actress (seiyuus) and their special kind of bond that healthily influence each other\'s lives to do their best in their craft.Chikako, has a stage fright due to her previous professor\'s strict way of teaching, which lowered her self-esteem and her confidence in portraying her roles.Minato, on the other hand, is new to voice acting and does a decent job but lacks the emotions and doesn\'t quite understand how to ""breathe life...into a character"".I like how the characters are portrayed in such a way that it\'s convincing. Like, I could see a person like Chikako or a Minato in real life and I wouldn\'t be surprised.

Gurazeni,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35183/Gurazeni,"[""Sports shounen is a popular genre. There are many shows that are about a team overcoming all odds in order to win the tournament. However less common is a show like Gurazeni that is less about winning and more about the lives of players in the Nippon Baseball League. There is no grand tournament, just a regular season of baseball. There is no high stakes in the matches, and while they do matter to an extent more weight is put into the characters and the experiences that they go through. The real stakes in the matches are the livelihoods of the characters who are effected...by how well they do in the game.The main character Bonda is a LOOGY, a Lefty One-Out GuY. LOOGYs are not the most prized part of a baseball team and in fact it's usually a role that while in demand doesn't have much allure to it. However Bonda's story is not about him overcoming the LOOGY role into some more but rather about how life is working as a LOOGY. In this way it is also unique from the rest of sports shounen anime. While many of them use the humble beginnings as a way for the player to rise up in the ranks, that seems to be less of the case here. While it does seem like Bonda is getting better with time, it's not in such a extreme fashion like with most shows. Rather a gradual improvement that can often be seen in major league baseball players.The show does a very good job at showing the lives and struggles that come with all sorts of fringe players. Whether it be a talented rookie who has yet to have their big break, a veteren who is past their prime but is still trying to hang on, or Bonda the loogy, they all have stories to tell and they all have a lot of weight on their shoulders to do well, or risk getting demoted to the minors. It goes more into the realities of playing the game, and the all of the different hiccups that can effect one's livelihood.While Bonda himself puts a lot of focus on money, especially in the first episode, that does subside and is more of a side story to the pain point than the actual focus. It's more of a subpoint to sort of focus on the situation that these players are in and how they still need to earn their paychecks despite the somewhat alluring role that they are in.Another thing I liked is how much focus they put into the skills of these players. Bonda may just be a loogy and be a lower role compared to most players but that doesn't mean he lacks talent, and it doesn't mean that he's not athletic. The show does well to show that despite his role, and his body shape that he does have athleticism, and is better than your average lay man. After all even the small fries are still a professional baseball player.While the show can be a bit slow with the explainations, especially of things that most baseball fans would know, I personally didn't mind it much. Even though I knew it all I think I'm just used to it from watching a good amount of kids shows. Also the general experience of this show taught me a good amount about how the Nippon Professional League works. Since most of my experience is in watching the MLB, it's interesting to see the similarities between the true.For those who are interested in baseball or already love the sport, I personally recommend this as a good watch. There is a lot of nuance and a lot of good tidbits that are picked up from watching these players play each game. I enjoyed the take that it has on the sport and liked it's unique flavor.

Much like every living person in our society, he is also the victim of capitalism. According to his contract, he gets payed based to his performance rather than based to his name and team ownership. He really likes shekels so this obviously sucks. Fortunately for him, he has a plan: to be the best payed pitcher in the world. To achieve this, he simply has to be the best at it (at pitching). Hence the English name of this show: Money Pitch. Good for him, I guess.Apparently, the initial target audience consists...of working-class citizens who are interested in slice of life comedy centering around sports, but not really sports -- rather salary and statistics related to sports. Basically, the more time you spend on creating meaningless Excel sheets, the more likely you are able to enjoy this show.There really isn't much else to say about the story, so let's not. The characters are great tho. Natsunosuke Bonda, the main character, is really special. His only merit is how not a single person on this website has added him to their favorite characters list. His favorite past time is studying statistic centering around other players. He has memorized everything about every player except their salary. Random characters ask him to guess how much some player earns and he guesses with almost 100% accuracy how much their income is. Amazing skills, bro. The other main character was not even introduced before the series ended. Talk about change of plans.The art and sounds are based Deen. Not exactly as gloriously animated as the original F/sn nor as cute as Ito Junji anime, but overall passable production. Weird choices have still been made. For one, they constantly change between CGI and hand-drawn on the fly when it comes to the actual pitching scenes. Looks pretty bad and messy.Overall this show is not especially good nor bad. It suffers from niche target audience which is the main reason for its low mean score. This series will not appeal to many. Most viewers will find it boring. Even those who became fans of it will be disappointed by how short the series end up being. One cour length despite the source material having content for 50-70 episodes.

The girls in the OP and ED have so far not yet presented themselves, most likely as family members/ acquaintances. I hope they can still keep the comedic pace. statistics, for those interested to learn, and concerns of baseball team management board behind the glamour of keeping a star player.Overall, while Gurazeni is not made out for typical anime audience, it is still enjoyable as a light-hearted sneak peek into the professional sports field in Japan.Side note: the Ending Theme is really cute, hope to hear its full version.

"", ""Gurazeni is an anime about professional baseball in Japan, and as simple as they may be, that is really the best description of the show you'll get in a single sentence.This isn't a sports anime with over-the-top shounen tropes or hype scenes, but instead this is an anime that takes a more realistic approach to sports and gives viewers a look at what goes on behind-the-scenes of Japan's largest professional sports competition, baseball, and I think this is a pretty unique and fresh take on the genre.The Story - 7Gurazeni is a fairly episodic anime. What happened in the last episode most likely won't get...much mention in the current episode, like how most episodic shows are. Each self-contained episode brings in a new aspect of professional baseball to expose to the viewer which keeps the series from getting stale. Each episode also brings in new characters, which I will go into more details in a bit. Something I found cool about Gurazeni is that the story isn't focused on a baseball prodigy at all, but instead a near-bottom ranked professional player just trying to get by.The Art/Animation - 5There isn't too much to say about this show visually. The art is nothing amazing but it's not like it's bad by any means. Same goes for the animation, it gets the job done and for the most part it. The only bad thing I can think of is the CG pitching animation that they use a few times throughout the show, which feels out of place as a lot of CG animation does in a 2D show, but admittedly it could be a lot worse.Sound - 5Gurazeni's sound is for the most part mediocre but I would give it credit for it's upbeat rap OP which I find pretty catchy. The rest of the soundtrack however is very forgettable.Character - 6Like I mentioned before, each episode brings in new characters. There are hardly any characters that get reused for episodes, with the exception of course being the main character. Most of the weekly characters aren't particularly interesting by themselves, but become interesting when they interact with Bonda, the MC. The main character doesn't have any noble or honorable goals like you would expect, but instead just wishes to pitch better in order to get a higher contract, and make more money, hence the title.Enjoyment - 7Gurazeni has an odd pulling factor. I can realize that there is nothing overly great about this show and yet it for some reason became one of the shows I looked forward to the most each week. I wanted to see Bonda get more money. I wanted to see what goes on in a bottom-ranked pro player's daily life. If I knew this was what I was getting myself into beforehand I probably would've turned away from this show to save myself from boredom, but somehow Gurazeni managed to keep me intrigued.Overall - 7If you are looking for a realistic sports anime, or just something to relax and watch every now and then, then I would definitely recommend for you to give Gurazeni a try. much mention in the current episode, like how most episodic shows are.

The main focus isn't so much on the playing of the sport but rather it's on the things you may see around it. This would entail the livelihood of the baseball players(ex-players and current),the staff, media etc. Most importantly however is the money that would be involved within all of those things which is where the show gets it's name from. With Gurazeni being a seinen series, it will bring with it a different vibe as opposed to the shounen...ones that may be more recognizable. Related to this point, Bonda, the main character of the show is a relief pitcher which is a stark contrast to the ace pitcher protagonists that are the norm.I had expectations of good things going into the first episode but those were shattered pretty quickly as the episode had a really rough start. The main causes of this is the CGI which felt jarring and also the story which felt like it was weak. After a while the CGI becomes tolerable as it doesn't happen often and you learn that the story of the show is an episodic one and after about three or four episodes it starts to become enjoyable, so much so that in terms of enjoyment it ranks highly among the shows I've seen in the season at the point in time this review was written. Apart from the CGI, the art of Gurazeni is average at best which would make it the worse component of the anime unfortunately.The soundtrack itself wasn't really memorable however the show does have very good, catchy tracks for it's Opening and Ending songs.The characters are a selling point for Gurazeni as they would need to be in slice of life type of show like this one. The aforementioned Bonda, may take a while to warm up to but you eventually grow to like his character as the stories unfold. As the show is episodic, each of the mini stories within the show are tied to newly introduced characters and for the most part they are enjoyable as well and some will even appear again from time to time.Overall I think Gurazeni is a nice niche show but it's a difficult show to recommend because of some of the issues it has. If maybe you're looking for a change of pace from the regular baseball anime then Gurazeni is one that you can consider giving a try. ones that may be more recognizable.

This show does a good job explaining some baseball lingo and the culture of the game.Gurazeni: Money Pitch follows the story of 26-year old Natsunosuke Bonda, a left-handed relief pitcher for the Spiders. His role is a LOOGY (Left-Handed One Out Guy), who tries to get only one of the opposing batters out, who are usually of the other dominant hand. They usually only last one inning at the maximum. The thing that separates Bonda from the rest of the...characters is that he has memorized every contract in his league. When he pitches, if a player has a lower contract than him, he\'s more likely to get them out opposed to when a player has a higher contract than him.Bonda\'s journey is very similar to players in real life. Bonda has been lucky enough to net himself a 16 million yen contract, but it means nothing when compared to a 100+ million yen contract and his future. Your play on the field is your worth, and people won\'t want you if you\'re not worthy. Bonda is an easily replaceable player on the Spiders. Despite playing professionally for eight years, Bonda isn\'t a star on the Spiders. The only time he gets recognition is when he publicly humiliates himself, usually when he\'s drunk.Gurazeni: Money Pitch shows a very good picture of the lives of the side characters too, usually giving them one episode. Whether it be an up and coming rookie, to a player striving to make it out of the minors, or even to a retired color commentator, we all get to see a peek of what their lives are like. When baseball players retire, most of them haven\'t made enough to live off of, and instead get jobs in sports media or as a manager.Bonda\'s love interest is very different than what is typically common in the baseball world. Bonda\'s placement in ""baseball society"" puts actresses and models way out of his league. Instead, Bonda settles for a part-timing, ditsy college waitress at a restaurant near the Spiders\' ballpark. In the second season, despite Bonda\'s attempts to conversate are hesitant due to her support of Bonda\'s rival baseball team. This creates a conflict for Bonda to overcome in a (hopefully coming) third season.There\'s not a whole lot to say about the soundtrack. The opening and closing songs are very catchy, though they are used abundantly.All in all, Gurazeni: Money Pitch is worth your time, there\'s never a dull moment. the only negative I can think of is the animation, which often uses poorly done CGI for lots of the baseball scenes. If you can get past that minor inconvenience, this show can be very enjoyable. characters is that he has memorized every contract in his league.

These guys are the sports equivalent of a plumber, necessary but nobody would call it glamorous work. They're typically called into bail out starting pitchers when the situation starts going south, deal with one specific batter, or simply eat up innings in lopsided games. Main character Bonda Natsunoske is a middle reliever for the Tokyo Spiders (a thinly disguised version of the...real life Tokyo Swallows) and this series is episodes in his life as he tries to claw his way up from an expendable middle reliever making $180,000 a year to a much more glamorous (and well-paying) job in the starting rotation. There isn't much continuity, few other characters stick around for more than one episode and there aren't many plot threads that affect things over the long haul. But the more self-contained nature of each episode makes it easier to put down and pick back up again.ART & SOUNDThere's no delicate way to put this: the animation just scrapes its way over the passing bar in most shots and Gurazeni loves to switch to a CGI model that nobody would confuse for the original 2D animation every time Bonda is pitching. There just isn't anything remarkable in this department at the best of times. Except perhaps for the character designs, which go outside tropey looks to give the cast some identity. Sound is also unmemorable too.CHARACTERAs the only character who gets significant screentime across the entire series, Bonda is clearly the glue that holds everything together. And he's not a bad character: he's keenly aware of the incredibly tenuous nature of the job of a professional athlete and keenly tries to both save his money and bump up his stats so he can earn more next season. His keen awareness of where his salary ranks in comparison to other players reinforces this trait- it's a running gag that he can bulldoze batters who make less than him but tends to become intimidated when pitching to players who make more. It makes him relatable since when you strip away the baseball elements he's basically a 20-something guy trying to turn his (relatively) low paying job into a more permanent gig. Other cast members usually get one episode in the spotlight then may make one or two cameos in the rest, so there isn't much to talk about beyond their one gimmick.ENJOYMENTI enjoyed this as a weekly diversion, but I don't see this as a very binge-able show or the kind of series where you get hooked and just HAVE to keep up.OVERALLIt's basic, and just OK at best. But for some reason I didn't get bored or start to hate it and actually want to see the upcoming season. real life Tokyo Swallows) and this series is episodes in his life as he tries to claw his way up from an expendable middle reliever making $180,000 a year to a much more glamorous (and well-paying) job in the starting rotation.

This show is about a professional relief pitcher, but as the episodes go on and on, you realize that this show basically is just an episodic anime about baseball with Bando interacting with different characters each episode. It feels like every episode is just a random episode with a random character with Bando in it. These standalone episodes are not BAD, it's just not good. It does not culminate into anything, and nor are the individual episodes good enough...to be watched by themselves. For a show about sports, its extremely fragmented and involves almost no story progression, with the main focus of the show being Bando's worries, and the worries of other players.Plus, the CGI is just terrible. There is a lot of it, and it's very apparent that the producers of the show were very lazy. For a baseball anime, the MAIN CHARACTER's PITCH IS ALWAYS CGI. Really dude? You just CG'd the main character's pitch because you're lazy to do that? I get the outfielders being CG'd, but the main character's pitch too? Come on. There is a definite limit to what you can just badly CGI, and CGing the pitch for the main character is going way too far.Another thing I noticed about this show is that despite the show involving a lot about Bando's thoughts, worries, and habits, a lot of his habits are only featured when it is convenient for the show. Otherwise, it is ignored and is continuing as usual. Bando's actions are kind of confusing sometimes as a result.Lastly, I'd like to point out the female lead. You'd think that the female lead would appear very early in the anime, occupying a lot of space on the cover art, OP, and ED. But no. She appears in the very last episode of the first season, and is a weak character that's super boring. And Bando's thoughts about her are as vanilla and boring as the author could make it. Man, that was bad.In conclusion, the entire anime is episodic, even though it is a sports anime, which is very different, unique, and definitely a risk, and it definitely did not pull off. It ended up making the episodes fragmented and of course, made it so that you were not invested in the characters or team by the end of the season like most classic sports anime end up doing. That would be fine, but the episodic episodes are also not bad, but definitely not amazing. They don't stand out very well, and as a result, you're watching through 12 episodes of kind of stale episodes, with basically no hope of it getting any better due to the fragmentary and episodic nature of the anime. Everything is CG'd to save money, even Bando's pitches are, which are very disorienting when he pitches a lot, and he is the main character. You really don't want to be CGing such an important action. Lastly, the female lead first appears in the last episode of the season, and has a weak introduction along with Bando's interactions with her.Maybe you should wait before producing a second season of Gurazeni, instead of going right in. I'm surprised this show got a green light to get adapted in the first place. It's pretty boring, and despite me finishing this entire first season, I really don't have any intention of starting the second, because the first season explained to me that this show has no future, and any hope with the female lead died on the episode she got introduced.

There are plenty of non-sports fans who actually enjoy sports anime. The reason being that those shows are closer to anime than they are to the sport they are portraying in the story. Gurazeni does not follow that pattern. It\'s a sports anime that portrays the sport as close to real as one can in the medium.Story:The story follows a middle relief pitcher in a Japanese baseball league modeled after Japan\'s NPB. He plays for a team stylized after the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, with many other teams being...modeled after other real teams in the NPB. The main point of the story is about the pitcher\'s pursuit of that big payday. His understanding that he must make as much money as he can playing baseball fuels his performance. This creates a very realistic story about a guy just trying to get what he can before his luck runs out. The story really caught me, as it wasn\'t the typical chase for glory, but the chase for stability. It mirrors how baseball works in real life, where the non-star players basically have to skate on thin ice 24/7, knowing that a few bad games can cost them their job. It\'s really captivatingArt:The show isn\'t extremely impressive for the most part. It\'s mostly standard 2D animation, though they do use 3D animation during action scene on the field and with the usage of vehicles. There\'s nothing I would call ""bad"" from an art standpoint.Sound:The theme songs for this show are actually really catchy. The opening theme is called Merigo by Cypress Ueno to Robert Yoshino. The ending theme is called Shadow Monster by Asako Toki. Both songs can easily get stuck in your head after hearing them enough, and are not in any way annoying. The BGM wasn\'t super  noticeable, but didn\'t suck either.Character:The main character, Natsunosuke, is a very great main character. He\'s not you typical anime protagonist with a hero streak. He\'s just a regular, everyday normal guy who just happens to play baseball. He has his insecurities in regards to his standing with his team, and is constantly thinking about the possibility that his baseball career could come to an end. This makes him very realistic and relatable. They was his friends and teammates are portrayed is also hyper-realistic. The struggles they all deal with in regards to their professional careers is what helps drive the show when it\'s not focused on Natsunosuke.Enjoyment:This show never felt overwhelming or over-dramatic. Each episode had a great story that helped you dive deeper into the lives of Natsunosuke and his teammates. The situations portrayed covered many topics of his life, and helped make the show feel diverse and alive. It\'s the easiest-to-watch sports anime I\'ve ever seen.Overall:It\'s the best sports anime I\'ve ever watched. This show does not have a single anime bone in it\'s body. It\'s all about the game. No long anime speeches. No fundamental moves with fancy names. No over-the-top reactions. Just the realistic portrayal of a middle reliever trying to get that bag before his career ends.

Also i loved ending theme song(btw nightcore version is best). <3Characters was good for thier roles in this story.I enjoyed Gurazeni.Not bad also unique seinen genre anime.

It's not about high stakes or becoming the best that anyone ever was. Bonda is just a baseball player. A middle relief pitcher, one of the most forgotten positions in the game. This story is about the day to day life of an athlete, hoping that he can just survive after the game. It's a side that many of us don't normally think about. Hell, a lot of athletes don't think about it either. It's incredibly cool to get an inside look at how he handles the stress of being a professional baseball player while also trying to handle...normal things, like relationships with friends and a crush on a girl.It's simple, it's cool. Like any other American kid, I grew up playing Little League and I've seen my share of MLB, but I've always been more drawn towards soccer, hockey, and football.

While it's largely infamous for its extreme violence and generally perverse subject matter, it's also noteworthy in that Harada largely worked on the project by himself.

While considered lost media for a long time by his small but dedicated fanbase, it finally saw the light of day in its entirety last year and I'm glad it did.The film's narrative is...a deceptively simple one as it revolves around a teenage boy who is regularly accosted by bullies and his cruel, authoritarian teachers. Limitless Paradise uses this as a springboard to vent palpable anger at the Japanese school system, which is depicted as callous and fascistic. The film similarly does this through its incredibly expressive animation and imagery, conjuring up imagery of imperialism, war and Hell all in order to articulate the film's core message in as visceral and incendiary a manner as possible.

IS: Infinite Stratos 2 - Infinite Wedding,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33242/IS__Infinite_Stratos_2_-_Infinite_Wedding,"[""Infinite Wedding is an adaptation of apparently the last few updated chapters of the light novel.The music, openings, etc. are really, really enjoyable;the chorus and instruments fit so well together.The biggest problem I have and I think many other fans of this series has is the character development and latter.These characters are created greatly, Houki, Charlotte, Laura etc. All of these heroine's have essential ground to create lots of story content, but it never, ever happens.This OVA is cute, it has great music, and I've always personally loved the art, and animation that Infinite Stratos has offered.If you took nothing from this review, just know...this. You will get lots of squabble and no progression in this adaptation.I still await patiently for Izuru to write more exciting plot rather then changing the personality of every character every time something is released. This series has so much potential, but yet I still find the potential in FanFiction more then the original work.This OVA is available through the blu-ray special edition. You can find it online, but you'd have to traverse forums. I'd just buy it;if you really want the official squabble.Final Verdict - Fantastic music, good animation, it is overall very cute/funny. Other then that, it is bland, it has squabble and no plot, makes itself out to be cannon fodder for merchandise.I'll stick with fan works. ;) this.

I  have got to see this.Reality: It\'s a Picture drama. the girls are just chatting about their ideal weddingYeah...... I will be honest I thought this was some kind of epilogue or something and it\'s been years since I watched the show so I finally decided to knock this out, but it\'s really disappointing. one would not miss anything by skipping out.Ichica is the textbook Harem Protagonist Dense as a rock, and won\'t pick one girl or maybe all of them but I don\'t...have any faith in this author to write a polyamorous relationship well.There is a reason the harem genre is dying or changing as Infinite Stratos is the textbook example for the genre as it was. have any faith in this author to write a polyamorous relationship well.There is a reason the harem genre is dying or changing as Infinite Stratos is the textbook example for the genre as it was.', 'Do you remember the old saying ""once you hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up""? Well, apparently, someone forgot to tell that to Infinite Stratos, which keeps reaching new and abysmal lows with each new installment. If World Purge wore my patience for Infinite Stratos thin, this particular story put it on life support. How bad it was? Well, let\'s hop on and find out, shall we?There are gonna be spoilers, but come on, do you really care?StorySo, the girls are having a day off and having fantasies about how their perfect wedding with Ichika would feel like. I like the idea...(again, the idea) of girls trying to picture the future with the men they love but the execution was painfully lacking. Every time one specific girl has a fantasy, another girl has to ruin it and this gets repeated over the coruse of the entire story and we are supposed to find it funny.Laugh. Come on, laugh. Laugh, you fool. Why aren\'t you laughing? This is top-tier writing! Good grief.

The girls don\'t grow or evolve in any way during the course of the story, which only serves to reminds us of what we have known all the way back in season 1: they love Ichika. It\'s like that\'s their only defining trait as characters.Speaking about Ichika, it seems that the show itself has lost all respect for its main character. For most of this story, Ichika is treated either as a prop for the girl\'s stories at best or as a butt monkey at worst. Ichika is in a serious competition to become the ultimate beta male in anime history. (3/10)ArtProps should be given to the series for attempting to trying out something different with the story, but I just hated that the story was presented as, well, a PowerPoint presentation rather than as a fully animated feature. It\'s like the crew of the show just threw up their hands and lost faith in the IP. (4/10)SoundsGod bless the brave voice actors who partook in this steaming pile of garbage. Infinite Stratos doesn\'t deserve them. This is the first Infinite Stratos story that I watch in its original English and it feels so refreshing to listen to the talents of Kouki Uchiyama (Ichika), Youko Hikasa (Houki), Kana Hanazawa (Charlotte) and Marina Inoue (Laura). They\'re all personal favorites of mine and it just breaks my heart watching their talents get squandered by something so generic and mediocre. (8/10)ConclusionWith its recent installments, it\'s obvious that Infinite Stratos is facing a dark and uncertain future. It\'s 2021 and we haven\'t gotten any news for season 3, which should have been instead of this... whatever you wanna call it. What\'s really sad about all of this is that ever since season 2, the show has failed to do both the characters and the story justice and I\'m just left worried about what will happen to Infinite Stratos now that so many years since its very first episode made it to broadcast.

Ikkitousen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/257/Ikkitousen,"['Ikkitousen is loosely based on the infamous Chinese novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms which is set around 200 AD. As a person who knows quite a bit of the history during that period, I find easy to understand the relationships between characters and what the anime is trying to bring out. But I must admit it will be quite difficult for an average person with no background to try to understand what is going on in the story.So before any further rating of the show, I would like to give a bit of advice to those who plan to watch this. IF YOU...HAVE NO INTEREST IN CHINESE HISTORY (though rather twisted if you ask me), AND IF YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO DIG OUT SOME HEAVY FAN SERVICING ANIME, THEN THIS IS NOT FOR YOU! You might as well go watch hentai instead.Yes, I agree that the fan service is very abundant (ridiculous is the term I would use), but I don\'t see the point in watching this if fan service is all you are looking for.Story:Trying to make a modernized version of the ancient war in China was a good idea to begin with. Though trying to retell it (even a small portion of it) in 13 episodes is just too much a task. The concept of the story is simple enough if you know the history.At the end of the Han Dynasty, the government became corrupted and the local governors and warlords took over and began building up their power. Which in our case, the local governors and warlords are nothing but the seven schools. At the end, three overlords eventual dominated China resulting in the period of the Three Kingdom (which was explained at the end of the anime). Here are some links if you are interested.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Dynastyhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_KingdomsI rate it 7 because I don\'t find it very original, and messing up the genders of the characters in the Romance of Three Kingdom is just...wrong. Oh, and I really don\'t see much point in all those street fights.Art:Nothing too fancy...don\'t expect too much from it, after all it is made in 2003. But it is still decent for its time. Note that I am rating it based on the year of its production, NOT by current standard.Sound:I like the OP but everything else is just what one would call ""standard"" in the anime industry.Character:I can understand that the producer tried to build up some character introduction/developments but mostly ended in failure. That is not to say that they did poorly, but rather it was just too much for 13 episodes. (One got to understand that the actual cast for the Romance of Three Kingdom is ENORMOUS, the producer handpicked a very few exceptional ones only)Enjoyment/Overall:I don\'t recommend Ikkitousen to people looking for fan service. It is better for you to watch hentai. Seriously, there are more than enough scenes in Ikkitousen that are on par to hentai. However I do recommend this to fellows who might want to see how the story of Romance of the Three Kingdom can be turned into in a modern day Japan. Overall, I enjoyed the anime and had no regret watching it. In fact I might rewatch it after finishing Ikkitousen: Dragon Destiny and Great Guardians.

Some arse kicking fights!"" But I was so horribly wrong!!There is NOTHING great about the series. The characters fight for no reason. They fight like bersekers without using their minds, breaking each other for no reason, then will ally afterwards, then fight each other again, and use insanely powerful blows on each other, but still manage to come out alive. Dreadful!Regarding character development, there is nothing great again here. The main girl lead is just a battle-addict-crazy. She is accompanied by another girly man who appears to fight like a...god, but of which we are not shown almost anything. It\'s just fight, fight, fight and fight. No story, no reason for fighting.The story is not well developed. IMHO, I really believe they just copied Tenjou Tenge, changed the characters and created a sort of pseudo story without any meaning. I really mean it, they COPIED Tenjou Tenge (TJTG). Go watch TJTG and you will see the many similarities by yourself.The only thing good about it is the enormous amount of fan-service and ecchiness. In almost every episodes, you will get to see the panties and bra of almost all the main girl characters. In the middle of the fight, you will see shirts getting ripped and skirts being blown open to reveal the characters` underwear. There is also a fair amount of sex, although nothing much is shown. This anime, with some more ecchiness, would be a hentai. Amidst model-sized bodies, large bust sizes and lots of in-between leg shots, the fight rages... Lolz! Hentai, I tell you!(I never knew girls would give such kicks with a skirt to expose their panties so often..)Mind you! The cloth-ripping and underwear-popping-out thingies happen to only girls. The boys NEVER get their clothes torn, no matter what happens. What`s more? A kick is able to reduce a shirt or skirt to shreds, but the underwear remain intact! I don`t know of what material those underwear are made of, but I guess titanium threads. They NEVER get ripped! Skin can get bruised, bones crack, blood splurts but the bra remains undefeated! OMG! o_0Returning to the story, the characters appear to fight for almost no reason. They wear some ear-ring objects which supposedly contains the soul of legendary fighters. So? They are supposed to fight because of that? And for what? The domination of the territory? In what way is this useful? Wakaranai! I have no single idea! Conclusion? The plot line su*ks!Now, I would like to point out parallels between Tenjou Tenge and Ikkitousen. Tenjou Tenge (TJTG) comes first, followed by Ikkitousen.Nagi Souchiro => Sonsaku HakufuBob Makihara => KoukinTodoh Accademy => Nanyang SchoolDisciplinary committee => Disciplinary Committee4 main characters (Nagi, Bob, Masataka, Aya) = 4 main characters (Sonsaku, Koukin, Ryomon, Gakushu)Main character has a dragon => Main character has a dragon too, though pitifully illustratedUltra powerful blows => Here tooFanservice => Duh! Same!As you can see, there are many similarities between TJTG. But nevertheless, I will still prefer Tenjou Tenge. I have been deceived by the anime, and I do not believe I would be re-watching it anytime soon. Conclusion: It`s just a fight-fight-fight-ecchi-hentai-fight-kick-fight-ecchi anime with no good plot line. A great enjoyment for those who appreciate fan-service. Watch TJTG if you want the same thing, but with more fun, and better story but with a long filler. (Can\'t get everything, can you?) god, but of which we are not shown almost anything.

Though, that's not to say that it wasn't rather enjoyable, and I must admit that I was surprised that I was able to finish it, and still feel a sliver of satisfaction after watching it. There were many things that could have been done much better-- that would have made this a better series-- but if you leave your expectations and occasionally your sense of decency behind, this is not a terrible watch.Story: A good concept gone to waste most of the time, and slightly silly to boot. A plot lightly touching on pre-destination and the...inevitability of fate is often overshadowed by minor squabbles or situations clearly designed to pander to more base tastes. That said, there are some moments of inspired story-telling, but these are very, very few and far between. After watching the entire story through to the finish, I must admit that I am left a little confused as to the point of the whole thing. Is destiny inescapable, or can it be overcome with sheer willpower? Even though this should be a thought-provoking ending, I found it felt rather lazy and incomplete.Art: Some nice character designs, restricted by outdated animation and again pandering to lusty teens. Big-breasted characters, multitudes of up-skirt shots, and clothes apparently the consistency of tissue-paper tell you exactly the demographic this series is aimed at. The background art is so-so, and the fighting sequences are nicely executed-- have seen better though.Sound: Again, there is nothing particularly outstanding about the OP or ED for this series. In fact, the lyrics have absolutely nothing to do with the series as a whole, and feel decidedly out of place. Seiyuu performances aren't terrible, and despite being a rather annoying character, Asano Masumi's performance as Hakufu fits with the feel of the character. Other characters of note are Kaida Yuko as Ryoumou and Watanabe Akeno as Ryoufu.Character: With a slew of characters from different schools all introduced in thirteen episodes, it can get very difficult to place who is from what school, what their relationships are to one another, and what their motives are for fighting. Often inconsistent characters (see Ryoumou from the first few episodes to the rest of the season), at times shallow personalities and changeable alliances, make it somewhat difficult to empathise with particular characters. Some of the female characters are fleshed out a bit -- not a lot -- but significantly more so than the male characters, who all seem to be suffering from two-dimensional personalities. That's not to say the female characters fare much better. Some moments of character growth shine like diamonds in this series, but again they are very few and far between.Enjoyment: As a female watching this series, I probably can't rate it as highly as some might, as I found the fan service a little too distracting, and the situations a little too laughable to rate this a 'good' series. Despite multiple 'roll-eyes' scenarios, this series was rather enjoyable. The fights were interesting enough, the characters dilemmas were occasionally interesting and while it wasn't expanded on nearly enough, the whole pre-destination/pre-determination concept was really what kept me hooked throughout the thirteen episodes. Enjoyable in parts, and rather cringe-worthy in parts, I still found myself smiling by the time it was all over.Overall: Could have been much better than it was. Perhaps toning down some of the fan service and focussing on building a more substantial plot may have made me rate this series a little higher. If story and character development don't matter much to you, and you're looking for a little fan service, this will probably be your thing. If you can't handle a hefty serve of the aforementioned, I think it might be better to give this series a miss. I enjoyed it, but I didn't like it, though I was never expecting it to be a particularly deep or thought-provoking series. So if you are able to lower your expectations and enjoy it for what it is you might find yourself enjoying this series. inevitability of fate is often overshadowed by minor squabbles or situations clearly designed to pander to more base tastes.

With way to many panty shots, and an overall patheticness surrounding it, I don't understand why you would want to watch it, unless you were into Hentai.When I read the review for Ikkitousen I thought that it would be worth the watch, but boy was I wrong, I literally had to force myself to watch it to the end so then i could advise people not to watch it. It is awful in every sense of the word.Lol Bai. "", 'Overview:A brilliant, modern adaptation of the Chinese novel: Romance of the 3 Kingdoms... in the same manner that the movie Friday is an adaptation of Tale of Genji.Plot: 1/10The plot is that a bunch of high schools are engaged in a turf war for control of Japan. The show tries at first to convince us that this is a clever allegory for the warring states period of Chinese history in which 3 kingdoms called Wu, Shu, and Wei fought each other for total domination of China. Firstly, a writer should never start out painstakingly explaining their own allegory and treating the audience like idiots....Secondly, any attempt at being clever or actually being a modernization of the classic novel are tossed out the window about 5 minutes in. This is a soft core porn that makes a half assed attempt at claiming to be a brilliant adaptation of a classic. Honestly I prefer it when the ""plot"" of a porn involves fucking the pizza delivery guy and not being ridiculously pretentious. The characters all are supposed to represent characters from the novel and for some reason wear magic beads that insure that they will have the same fate as their namesake in the novel. The real plot is that a bunch of chicks fight each other and tear clothes off with every kick and punch. There are also plenty of BDSM scenes involving hand cuffs, erotic asphyxiation, and urination. No one and I repeat NO ONE, has ever watched Ikki Tousen for the plot and left satisfied.Characters: 1/10The main character is Hakufu Sansaku, who is supposed to be the reincarnation of Sun Ce. Why the creators chose a secondary character as the series lead and not a larger role like  Liu Bei or Guan Yu is honestly beyond me. The main villain, who looks like a bitch and has the threatening power to decimate watermelons, is based of Dong Zhuo. Serious? That guy got killed in the first 50 pages. Apparently a character based on the actual main villain Cao Cao turns up in the 2nd or 3rd season, but honestly I felt I had watched more than enough Ikki Tousen after 1 season! If you haven\'t read Romance of the Three Kingdoms, let me sum this up in a simpler fashion. The main male protagonist is a bland loser, the only thing developed about the female characters are their tits, and the villains are laughably stupid.Sound: 2/10the soundtrack that plays during the fight scenes is completely underwhelming and the the opening and closing themes to quote Fullmetal Jacket,  both can suck a golf ball through a garden hose.Art: 5/10The art is I guess the high point of this series, if you want to call it a high point. It at least sucks less than everything else. Studio Arms knows how to draw tits decently well.Enjoyment: 1/10As a porn, this series probably won\'t arouse you. As an adaptation of a great Chinese novel, this series is a steaming dump on the source material. As an anime in general...this series sucks man!Overall: 2/10If you are a true connoisseur of crap, this is one notably bad anime that you can\'t afford to miss. If there was an anime version of MST3K, they would watch Ikki Tousen. Strictly for masochists only!

out a few of its ood points as well(if it has any of course)Story 6/10For those who lack the knowledge about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms or the Chinese history,then they probably gonna rate it a 1.Good thing for me that I wasn\'t so clueless and I\'m gonna have to thank Dynasty Warriors.Actually the reason why I gave this a try was this reason,the PS2 game by Koei that I so like.But it was a...big mistake cause there\'s no relation between them.It does try to do something ""original"" but fails in the process for a number of reasons.1st-Because it\'s a 13-episode anime.No time to et used to it and characters.2nd-Speaking about characters,it introduces a lot with very hard names and different kinds of roles that one can hardly remember.3rd-It doesn\'t focus on the story,it focuses on the fan-service.4th-If it still didn\'t focus on the fanservice it focuses on all the other things except for the story.5th-If you want to make a good story,let\'s ignore the fanservice for now.It wouldn\'t be full of females.Although it des try to do somethin as far as fate vs freedom of choice goes,but it\'s so terribly written that its basis is easily ignored.Art 2/10I don\'t have to o into detail.Just cause this is old it\'s not a big reason enough to explain this anime\'s aweful art and animation.The characters are just ugly,the hair weird,the animation awkward.Sound 3/10Didn\'t love any of it.The OP was very cheesy,somethin that should not be taken seriously.Heck I don\'t even remember the ED or any of the in anime music accompany the events.That alone shows that who ever decided to animate it didn\'t intend even for a little to make this a worthy anime.Characters 2/10I couldn\'t stand the main character.We have to do with an immature little irl who all it cares about is beat others,et naked in front of her cousin and call him a pervert after that.It\'s a shame that she is entitled being the strongest just as every main character but can\'t even beat her own mother who punishes her by spanking her(one more reason why it can\'t be taken seriously)Too many characters to remember that only appear once and then they disappear.Maybe Kouki was good out of the whole cast,but his role was only to appear in two or three episodes.He then disappears like the rest to make way for fanservice.Except for Kouki it\'s worth pointing out another good character and that bein Ryomou Shimei before being raped by Ryofu.Enjoyment 3/10I literally forced myself to watch all 13 episodes and I congratulate myself that I made it,same goes for the rest of the fellows.This was more of a hentai than a anime.Call it ecchi or whatever,this was just censored hentai and nothing more,nothing less.Even hentai would be more enjoyable than this anime.Overall 4/10This is high,but I consider myself a generous person and I wouldn\'t want to drag with it the good elements you can find in it(even a few) by giving it 1.It tries to hard to be many things at times,but by surprise fails

schools in Japan are waging out an all-out turf war for ruling the terriorities and one fighter stands out and her name is Hakufu Sonsaku. She is a high school student transfer to Nanyo Academy and she is a highly skilled fighter, but to make more amusing, she has the personality of a ditzy valley girl.Hakufu Sonsaku is basically just there for the money shots in the series. In mostly every scene in the series, this is an upskirt panty shot whenever she's fighting or doing whatever the hell she does. Not to mention, she really adds the unnecessary relationship between her...and her cousin Koukin whenever she obviously does stuff like spanking her ass, almost having her top off, and her uniform getting ripped to shreds every time she fights. Seriously, who made those uniforms, Brawny?

It’s mostly still shots of fighting instead of actual fighting because the animators were too busy of ridiculous boob physics.

You'll like it if you enjoy ecchi anime, fighting anime, or yes, So Bad Its Good series. I enjoy it for being a good show myself, but I can see how people would watch it out of sick fascination. The fact of the matter is, most people haven't read, and quite a few probably haven't even heard of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, so the story details it takes from that shouldn't matter. It's a fun series that knows what crowd is is trying to appeal to. I got into...it through the English manga, and I enjoy the macekering done to it; but I would suggest wary viewers start with the subtitled version of the anime, because the English voice acting is subpar, but does get a bit funnier because they can throw in more jokes with the script changes. If you're the kind of anime fan who can enjoy all kinds of shows and will give anything a chance, give this a try. If the anime doesn't get you into it, try the wackier English manga version for a bit.

But the resemblance ends at this point. While ""Tenjou Tenge"" upsets the trend of ecchi fightin anime by actually being GOOD (yep, you heard me correctly), ""Ikkitousen"" came off as a more typical offering of this type by letting the fanservice get in the way of everything else. In fact, ""Ikkitousen"" is so overflowing with fanservice that it\'s probably the closest an anime can get to being hentai without actually becoming a hentai.The concept behind Ikkitousen is rather bizarre. Basically, people...who were involved in the Three Kingdoms era (one of the most illustrious periods from ancient Chinese history) are being reincarnated as school girls from different schools. These girls all have a lust for battle (predictably), and so the battles from the Three Kingdoms era gets played out between these people from rival schools (each school is supposed to represent a Kingdom I think). It\'s like an anime about delinquents with a peculiar twist, and with all the characters being girls (in order to provide fanservice, of course).By now, you\'ve probably fallen off your chair laughing at this utterly ridiculous concept, but you might be surprised to know it didn\'t turn out to be a complete disaster... but not for the reason you might think. The reason had to less to do with competent story development and more to do with the fact that, between all the ecchi and fighting, there\'s not really much room left for ""Ikkitousen"" to expand on its farcical ideas. It\'s content to mostly sit back and give the occasional two-sentence narrative of how a current event is a parallel to what went on in the Three Kingdoms era. Though I\'m vaguely aware of some parts of the Three Kingdom\'s history, I won\'t pretend I\'m an expert, not by any stretch of the imagination. Armed with my primitive knowledge, the barebone armchair narrative helped me to understand... virtually nothing at all. Of course, it doesn\'t help that they\'re referring to those famous historical figures by their names translated into Japanese, but still, I can just imagine how lost someone would feel coming into this anime with little or no knowledge about that part of Chinese history. On the other hand, not developing the storyline can probably be considered to be a blessing in disguise. The concept is absurd enough as it is, god knows how it could have turned out if they actually tried to work something from it.As it stands, the anime ditched most of the story in favour of the ecchi and action. Though there are some intriguing personalities thrown in the mix (well, intriguing by the standard of an ecchi anime at least), they suffer somewhat from the lack of cohesion in the story, as it\'s hard to figure out what their motivations are at times. The action sequences are quite awesome in places, especially when you compare it against other anime of similar genre (such as ""Variable Geo"") and see how sucky they tend to be. However, the fanservice factor is just a plain nuisance. Its presence is so strong that it tramples over everything else that\'s going on, and is often distracting at the most inappropriate moments. It really needs to take a leaf out of ""Tenjou Tenge""\'s book and see how to provide fanservice without disupting the viewer from other aspects such as action and story. And while it\'s at it, it may as well learn a thing or two about proper plot development too!Other than a handful of great fights, this anime has very little else to offer. If you\'re after an anime of this particular genre, I would point you in the direction of ""Tenjou Tenge""... unless it\'s eichi that\'s primarily what you\'re searching for. who were involved in the Three Kingdoms era (one of the most illustrious periods from ancient Chinese history) are being reincarnated as school girls from different schools.

Many of the reviews you will read will mention the excess of fanservice and overall it just a waste of time and is nothing but boobs and panty shots. That aspect of the series isn't hidden, it isn't a surprise, so to watch something you don't like then bash it for the thing you knew you didn't like beforehand is quite silly.With the above being said, this series is heavy on fanservice, but know that compared to other fanservice-heavy series, the ecchi within this series...is 95% for YOU, the fan, has near zero to do with the interaction of characters and how they perceive each other with the exception of minor throwaway characters usually a part of a 'mob'. The female fighters of Ikkitousen don't have the time to worry about the state of their clothing in the face of an enemy who has the intent to do serious harm or kill, they are professional fighters and largely behave as such. The world of Ikkitousen isn't filled with nervous nosebleeds, blushing bashful girls, typical ecchi antics and weak male leads, so if your looking for that, this is not for you. Ikkitousen is serious, deadly serious. Not like a typical shounen action series where people get beat up and sleep it off; people get seriously hurt, hospitalized, disabled, and die.Story:Ikkitousen is a based on the Romance of the Three kingdoms, and as such, has an extremely high overhead in terms of potentiality to understand right off the bat. Personally this is one of the most difficult anime series we've tried to fully understand and grasp. After our 3rd re-watch in 4 years we only now feel that we fully understand it enough to write a review about it. This adaptation of the Three Kingdoms is not set in a historical time period as would be expected, but is instead superimposed on a modern day Japanese kanto region with the kingdoms and lands being represented by a series of high schools. These high schools in the region are essentially treated as kingdoms and lands and their students as warriors, each with the potential to be conquered and overthrown. In this world, the souls of warriors and lords from the Three Kingdoms era are sealed within 'Sacred Beads' and the spirits of these warriors and lords heavily influence the fates and destinies of these modern day students (simply called fighters) who bear the same name. It should also be noted that there is gender switching as this is modern day school life and male and females are both equally present opposed to the warring era where nearly everyone whom the story involves is male, so a large percent of the females share fates and names of male warriors of past (if you don't already know the Three Kingdoms, this will not bother you). Because of the modern day superimposition, sometimes some points of the story may seem a bit far-fetched, but nothing out of the realm of it being an anime, but what you must keep in mind that it is supposed to be as such, being a huge reincarnation of an entire era played out with high school students. Clothes rip, a lot, leaving ample room for fanservice, but what most don't notice is that the in-world reason for this is that, although not always apparent, the fighters in the world of Ikkitousen use ki/chi with their attacks which inevitably effect clothing, and the show isn't limited by audience or rating to how much clothing will be effected (compared to something like Dragonball Z where ki effected clothing only sometimes or very little).Story and Characters:Ikkitousen as a whole is a compelling story about conflicting feelings and emotions and a constant struggle towards the acceptance or rejection of predetermined fates given to fighters at birth. Most of the characters know history of The Three Kingdoms and the fates they have been handed down. Most characters are decently fleshed out considering the series length and some of the main focused ones undergo quite deep development and growth. The actions of the past are inevitably heavily influential over the actions and sequence of events in the world. At times the influx of information can leave you feeling a bit overwhelmed at the story, for Ikkitousen suffers for what we like to call 'The Curse of the +/-12 ep anime'. Its scope was too wide for its duration and because of that, we feel some leniency should be allowed. You will have to try to keep up with both first and last names of each character, what school they are from out of about 7, the historical significance and relations between characters atop of present day current events. All that being said it is a comfortable challenge and one that should be embraced for it encourages your mind to watch more actively over a passive experience.Story and Art:As Ikkitousen is mostly about fighting and the life and fates of fighters we can't ignore that. Unsure of weather to say it was a budgetary constraint or simply how it was meant to be, but the action sequences are merely slightly above average with the art itself being quite standard of its era (early 2000s). Very few series have long drawn out fluent fight scenes and this is no exception. It definitely serves its purpose, but fights are not very long and consist of mainly several volleys before a winner is determined. It is also worthy to note that those of you who have feminist-type views, though you may not find agreement in the ample bosoms and skimpy clothing and its ease of removal, there is one thing of much importance and that is that females are not damsels; far from damsels the female members of the cast are strong, and deadly so. The females of the series are as strong as, and have the potential to be easily stronger than, any given male character at any given time. That isn't to say that simply all females are stronger than males but simply that gender has no bearing on strength in this series, and that is refreshing seeing as it can easily sway one way or the other. Much of the series you may find yourself mentally creating a ladder of sorts on how each character's strength compares to another in terms of who they fought and won or lost against vs others, and it is encouraged you do so for it creates a playing field for how future potential interactions may go and their relation to one another.Summary and enjoyment:Overall don't be put off by the fanservice and come to believe its just another serving of ecchi as usual. If you hate fanservice, maybe give it a skip, but if you love action, historical influences, an over-arching epic-style plot, and even gender strength equality then this all may have a heavier weight than an aversion to fanservice. We found it very enjoyable, more with each re-watch due possibly due to becoming more mature to understand it better. But do keep in mind that although far from perfect, Ikkitousen is an enjoyable first building block for a long continuing saga that has great promise to flesh out and improve upon in its 3 sequels. is 95% for YOU, the fan, has near zero to do with the interaction of characters and how they perceive each other with the exception of minor throwaway characters usually a part of a 'mob'. The female fighters of Ikkitousen don't have the time to worry about the state of their clothing in the face of an enemy who has the intent to do serious harm or kill, they are professional fighters and largely behave as such. The world of Ikkitousen isn't filled with nervous nosebleeds, blushing bashful girls, typical ecchi antics and weak male leads, so if your looking for that, this is not for you. Ikkitousen is serious, deadly serious. Not like a typical shounen action series where people get beat up and sleep it off; people get seriously hurt, hospitalized, disabled, and die.Story:Ikkitousen is a based on the Romance of the Three kingdoms, and as such, has an extremely high overhead in terms of potentiality to understand right off the bat. Personally this is one of the most difficult anime series we've tried to fully understand and grasp.

The story is basically based on/ripped straight from the Chinese novel ""Romance of...the Three Kingdoms"" (which I haven\'t read), I can\'t say anything else about it.Every ""fighter"" has like this wierd earring crap containing the ""soul"" of some ancient figher, the earrings actually doesn\'t serve any purpose for anyone, the only thing the earring does is ""forcing"" the fighters to fight each other like a f*cking ""gang from da hood"". It\'s stupid.Art - 7, Yeah :D. Ikkitousen has good artwork, no doubt, but it\'s not perfect, like the backgrounds for example, there\'s isn\'t much more I can complain about when it comes to the art, maybe it was the eye candy here and there that made me not to complain too much.Sound - 6, Good. I really liked the intro (and no, it wasn\'t the embarrassing shots of Hakufu that made me like the intro), I would also say that the sound is pretty decent for an anime this old but god, the VAs didn\'t impress me one bit (the english dub, CURSE ME!), the sound part would get a 7 if the VA wasn\'t so bad.Character - 4, Meh. We got a feminine-looking guy, a blonde bimbo, some half-emo chick who appeared to (at least to me) being saddistic, but apparently not.Then we got minor characters who\'s stupid, like the rest of the cast.Enjoyment - 5, Ok. I would be lying if I said that I didn\'t enjoy Ikkitousen, but what made me keep watching it was not the girls getting their clothes got ripped apart, not the panty shots either, it was for one, and one thing only: So I can understand WTF is happening in the later Ikkitousen series.Overall - 6, Bottom line: Watchable, but not re-watchable.It isn\'t a good anime, I\'m sorry fanboys, the only thing I can say about it is that it\'s decent, nothing more.Feel free to give me some advice on how I can improve my review-writing. :) the Three Kingdoms"" (which I haven\'t read), I can\'t say anything else about it.Every ""fighter"" has like this wierd earring crap containing the ""soul"" of some ancient figher, the earrings actually doesn\'t serve any purpose for anyone, the only thing the earring does is ""forcing"" the fighters to fight each other like a f*cking ""gang from da hood"".

As much as I\'ve championed the series over the years, I\'ve also had some reluctance and reservations about giving a whole-heated recommendation to those that have asked me about Ikkitousen for fear of leading people astray and potentially wasting their time. So, hopefully I\'ll be able to coherently explain said reservations, which mainly apply to the first season, while also trying to explain what exactly season one...has going for it beyond ""There\'s just something special about it and that special thing works for me.""I might as well address the elephant in the room right off the bat, Ikki\'s artwork for season one was not great in 2003 and it\'s not great now. I wouldn\'t say that I have bone to pick with Shinya Hasegawa, but his character design is my lead reservation for why I say that Ikkitousen season one is a little rough compared to the massive improvements made in later seasons with Arms Corporation and Rin Shin at the helm, which have also aged but significantly more gracefully than Ikki season one’s character art. But at the same time, I suppose I could make a case for the artwork being nostalgic of the ""good old days"" of anime in the late 90\'s and 2000\'s and the purist notion of hand drawn animation, which wouldn\'t be a forgone conclusion for those like me who grew up in the 90\'s and 2000\'s. So just for the sake of clarity, I describe the character design as being just competent and could have used a revision or two, but it\'s also not as bad as Aku no Hana. Other than that, the environments/backgrounds and animations work well enough I suppose. It’s a far cry from how elaborate animation has become in later years, but the early 2000’s were simpler times.Another, but significantly less of a concern, is Ikki season one\'s story. It\'s pretty straight forward and easy enough to follow: Hakufu is pretty much your shonen adventure hero akin to Goku both in terms of having a love of fighting and also their intelligence; specifically in that they’re both pretty dumb. As far as introducing a series goes, it\'s pretty standard. But given that Ikkitousen isn\'t exactly the Pulp Fiction or the Unusual Suspects of anime, the standard ""protagonist on a quest to be the best that no one ever was"" works just fine. After all, the story of an ecchi series might as well keep the plot simple in order to keep the other form of ""plot"" going. But with that said, there are some moments, or set pieces, that are kind of real and even a bit raw. If anything, Ikki season one\'s story works best as a character study since many of the events are relevant to Hakufu\'s growth and progression throughout the narrative.While the story works well enough given the tools that ecchi generally gives, I can say with confidence that the characters can be one of Ikkitousen\'s strong suites depending on what you\'re looking for. As I\'ve said previously, Hakufu is your dumb but capable primary protagonist that provides comic relief. Koukin is one of the few somewhat important male characters of the show and mainly serves as a foil to Hakufu\'s stupidity. Ryomou is your anti-hero and a way better Rei Ayanami. Chuuei Toutaku is the big bad antagonist who has a thing for tummy licks. Goei is a MILF. Kan\'u doesn\'t become a main character until later on. And so on and so forth. The point is that there are plenty of characters to latch on to, though the female ones are generally the most important, as expected.With some of my more elaborate thoughts out of the way, I think it\'s time to almost wrap this up with some miscellaneous thoughts. Ikki season one does deliver on the martial arts action set pieces. Given that a sub plot is a king of iron first tournament against the rival schools, it would be pretty silly if no none threw a punch, and season one\'s fights are memorable enough. As for the ecchi, I\'m sure that saying ""panty shot"" a few times in a row rings familiar, and yes, season one delivers on that front as well, probably more so than the frights thanks to key scenes involving Ryofu. The Japanese voice cast works well enough. I can’t speak on the English cast much since my vague memory of Ryomou\'s English VO describing ""fight orgasms"" makes me recoil, so, my vote goes to watching the series subbed, And the opening theme, ""Drivin\' through the Night,"" makes me beg to have ""Wannabe"" by the Spice Girls on repeat as a significantly lesser form of torture. In other words: I don\'t like the opening theme very much. More power to those that do because it is not my thing, at all.So with all that said and done, can I actually, without any sort of irony, malintent, or rose-tinted glasses, recommend that anyone watch Ikkitousen? Well, for better or for worse, my answer is going to have to be ""it depends"" because it\'s niche appeal really depends on the audience. So would I recommend this to those that are completely new too anime? No, that would be absurd, same to the Shonen Jump casuals, or anime fans that only stick to ""high-minded"" shows and movies. So though what I\'m going to say should be pretty obvious, Ikkitousen (season one) is for ecchi fans, though specifically for those who like an old school art style, doesn\'t equate ecchi to just being harems, enjoys watching a very likeable cast of femme fatales duke it out, and actually want some kind of story to follow. Yes, season one is a balancing act between its faults and its niche strengths, but it did start the beginning for a series that’s a hidden gem to the right audience and has continued to go on for multiple seasons unlike it\'s contemporaries at the time, such as Tenjou Tenge.And also, Western Wolves is a thing.

Maybe too polished for some of us but...to me it was eye-candy. Characters are very neatly drawn, easy to recognize (unlike their names) and very colorful.

That\'s what attracted me to Ikkitousen to begin with.There are a HUGE amount of panties-shots throughout the entire series. Same goes for the breasts.

This is ridiculous, an anime which has random high schoolers fight each other to the death and follow the ""Fate"" of their beads just because their ancestor did it in this legend that, frankly, I could give two shits for. Now I know that the romance of the three kingdoms is a legend which this it based off of, but unless you know what the legend is and the details of the people within it you aren\'t going to be able to understand a lot of what happens...and it feels like a cheap way to get you to look it up. Now despite what others say that ""oh all this fighting is pointless"" is mostly true, the only reason I can see for all this is for the honor and tradition of their fallen ancestors. Anything more than that is all above my head, and even with this, to to the death seems to be a stupid way of going about it, especially when one member of every generation of the families must follow this ""fate"" that was given to them and end up dying the same way every single time. Do they really think that this is what their ancestors would have wanted them to live, doing the exact same thing that they did and dying the same way? No, it defeats the purpose of why they fought in the beginning.When getting into sound and art, this is an older anime than most so I\'ll cut it slack their. As for the character, when they aren\'t going on about the actually plot, they do have some enjoyable moments, kind of. And that where the praise ends, I\'m normally the one who likes to defend some animes that some may see as not so good, but this is not one of them.  I\'m going to watch the sequel to see if that got any better, but my money says probably not. and it feels like a cheap way to get you to look it up.

It's so terrible in fact that I believe it could be used as an educational resource in creative writing classes for how not to write a story; or characters for that matter.The events of the show are offensively and oppresively rushed, with exposition every five seconds and an absolute deluge of attempted tragic backstories that have no impact either because the characters themselves are uninteresting or have only been on screen for about two minutes. We also have what are supposed to be pivotal character moments happening for no reason...when there's even the smallest sign of conflict.The art is boring and the action scenes are therefore equally unsinspiring. The actions of the characters make no sense, or less than no sense, most of the time.

Sometimes the plot moved slowly and then picked up the pace signficantly so I lost track of what was going on. Well to tell you the truth, the plot was mostly driven by characters involved in it, in my opinion.The three main characters Sayb, Hort and Kuddo are all very likeable. Of the three I liked Kuddo the most. He was very level-headed and had such humourous reactions to different situations they...found themselves in. On the surface, Sayb is a bit bland as a protagonist, but he does progress alongside the plot.Art is mostly good, it is not anything special, but thankfully it is consistent.

I definitely do not regret spending time watching it.', 'This show in a summary: when your original work is presented much better than the one that came after it.There have been cases of authors already well-versed in their own series to try something new, and that is always appreciated in a sea of many other works to try what works and what doesn\'t work. This is exactly the case for author Kakeru Kobashiri and her famed work that is the Grimoire of Zero, already having won the Grand Prize in the 20th Dengeki Novel Awards held in 2013 (alongside novelist Chiaki Kisaki for Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens, which spawned Satelight\'s Winter 2018 anime), and then...White Fox\'s anime adaptation that came and went back in Spring 2017. Since then, it has been exactly half a decade since that show came out, and the sequel spin-off that is Mahoutsukai Reimeiki a.k.a The Dawn of the Witch has some digging into since it\'s a direct canon of the original series that it stems from, mostly for nostalgia reasons. Although, I would say that while you need not watch Grimoire of Zero to understand this show since this is a spin-off that borrows its context, the respite is that Mahoutsukai Reimeiki isn\'t a good sequel, or anything remotely close to the original series, at all.So first off, I understand if you didn\'t get that whole ""sequel spin-off"" rhetoric. By itself, you would definitely understand what\'s a sequel or a spin-off that\'s relative to many series that does the same thing. However, in Mahoutsukai Reimeiki\'s case, it\'s a mish-mesh of existing and new properties that coincides to make this series work: the setting and world-building that is the Kingdom of Wenias, the witch-hunt war between the humans (or rather, the Anti-Witch Church) and the witches with the witch-hunting group Dia Ignis all but disbanded when the war ended, and the recurring cast of characters in Grimoire of Zero, all make a comeback while giving updates on their perils. All of these make up the ""sequel"" effect, while the ""spin-off"" effect is just mainly on the new cast of characters on their own canon story that\'s the same, yet different from the original to stand out on its own.Let\'s cover the things that are new to the series: the rag-tag new quartet group that Royal Academy of Magic students and their teacher: Saybil, Holt, Kudo and Professor Loux Krystas. This series covers their tracks and refining them to be trained magic wielders in their own right, that are still in their infancies. Most particularly for Saybil, he\'s the main protagonist of this new sequel spin-off, his character being one that of boring, monotone aloofness, but with reason: he is a child of unknown origin, an amnesiac boy whom only knows of a silver-haired woman that bore the same eyes as him. To sum Saybil\'s magic up, he\'s just a magic vessel (or in the modern context of a powerbank) made within the premise that connects to the original characters and their intentions of his creation as such, but using it has a devastating caveat, in which his magic would spiral out of control. Holt on the other hand, she is a deer Beastfallen training to be a witch, the unequivocal top scorer of the Academy. Her origin story is that of a forced hand, her character growth being hampered by the whole witch-hunt war to then be forcibly and ostensibly chosen on a side that favours her while sub-consciously being part of the recurring war that\'s since ended in the original series that has seen former Dia Ignis Arbiter remnants continue the tradition because they wouldn\'t give up too easily. She can be a bit dull, while most times just being an on-and-off relationship-driven fodder that can be attributed to her overly concern for others, and in regards to the plot progression, I would say that she gets a decent pass for overcoming her childhood nightmares of torture to finally being alleviated of her past sin of being a Beastfallen. This is the same story for Kudo the lizard Beastfallen training to be a sorcerer, he has a brusque demeanor and can seem like the joker\'s tool at times, though beneath his condescending nature reveals his kind-heartedness for friends, and one whom always strives to be stronger. Kudo is someone whom like Holt, has undergone rough times when he was very young, being sold as a child slave at the behest of humans whom don\'t take a liking to Beastfallen, only to get saved by his rescuer that he wishes to thank one day for giving him a new life to live by. Kudo can be a bit hard to be a likable character, but he\'s low-key one of the good new characters to make a mark in this spin-off. The biggest detractor however is Professor Loux Krystas, also known as the Dawn Witch, a 300-year-old witch that despite her ""fountain of youth"" age, acts like a child loli character being obnoxious at times with her whininess. Her only strong point is her semi-sentient magic Staff of Ludens that can take on different forms and consume other witches\' magic to the verge of death, and the similarities to Zero after hearing of the Grimoire of Zero spellbook to set on a journey to find the book, and/or even maybe meet the girl in question. Also, there seems to be too much sexual provocation of the unkempt focus from showing her panties to focusing on her crotch at times, that is quite the bizarre pandering angles seen in this anime, and you\'re gonna see it a lot. The only antagonists are the Dia Ignis anti-witch remnants which only sought more trouble, and for the most part, it\'s through Tyrant that underwent a transformation from killing to helping witches, and I can already hear you say that it\'s the kind of plot that is easily predictable.Speaking of Zero, it\'s such a delight to have the recurring cast back: the legendary witch spellcaster herself, Youhei a.k.a. Mercenary, the headmaster Albus (which she is actually the Mooncaller Clan\'s representative witch Sorena\'s late granddaughter) with her servitude servant wolf Beastfallen Holdem, the blind priest and his servant Lily the Mouse Beastfallen. Most would speculate that there\'s a huge timeskip within the events of the anime to this show, and if there\'s one thing certain for sure, is that puberty has hit them hard since that much time has passed. For anyone not in the know, both Zero and Youhei are married to one another, and the latter finally having fulfilled his dream of owning a tavern for beastfallen, witches and humans alike. And that definitely shows in their relationship towards one another, which is exactly the same as in the original series (that was growing at the time), and now both of them being affectionate...well, mostly Zero that is, that her character model change is quite significant as is Youhei\'s, they\'re not the same girl and young adult Beastfallen that you remember back in Grimoire of Zero, but grown to a fine and captivating woman and adult-aged Beastfallen. But going back to Saybil\'s history, remember that silver-haired woman whose eyes matched his? Well, Zero is that woman, revealing herself to be his paternal aunt, the younger sister of the much maligned elder brother Thirteen whom only sought retribution of the world. But Zero\'s life hasn\'t been easy since the events of the anime, to the point of suffering from a lack of mana to revive Youhei in the original series. And this is where Saybil makes himself useful as the illegitimate child that\'s birthed out of a necessity for his limitless and powerful magic that\'s transferred through weird sexual innuendos from holding hands to literal kisses. I admit I cringed at Saybil\'s only purpose to be an unadulterated harem maker with his paternal aunt, Professor Loux and Holt, I definitely felt the weird tingles of this decision at this juncture.The rest of the anime however, I would like to point out certain facts. First, you can\'t blame Tezuka Productions\' in-house director Satoshi Kuwahara for the mess that is this show, he\'s mainly done shows that are assigned by the production committees when the studio is chosen, and he can only follow what\'s given of the scriptwriting, which he is also handling this aspect as well. More rather, if you have to have an entity to blame, it would be that the studio itself really isn\'t up to the task of producing action-heavy series. The reason why I know this is because, take a look at Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu a.k.a How Not to Summon a Demon Lord\'s Season 2 which inexplicably changed studios mid-way from Ajia-Do to Tezuka Productions, and I proclaimed that the production looked shoddy at best with lots of animation cuts that are a disservice to the prequel. This is no different here in Mahoutsukai Reimeiki, which falls back to the blatant copy-and-paste tactic that\'s found in yet another of the studio\'s show Kanojo mo Kanojo a.k.a Girlfriend, Girlfriend. Word of advice: don\'t ever assign things to studios that shows their inept and incompetent track record at features which feels too much for them to handle. It\'s just as bad as Isekai Maou\'s sequel season, and for yet another action-heavy show, that\'s saying something.The music...sounds mediocre and forgettable as hell. fripSide has been a very notable J-Pop and trance group made up of music composer Satoshi Yaginuma and the modern famed music artist Yoshino Nanjo, which explains why the duo\'s rise to fame throughout the 2010s to now has made the group a household name to expect of infinitely both memorable and decent songs across the board which defined the anime industry\'s music scene for years (i.e. A Certain Scientific Railgun). That was fripSide Phase 2, and thus with lead singer Yoshino Nanjo\'s departure and the two new members Mao Uesugi and Hisayo Abe, begins fripSide Phase 3. Their debut song ""dawn of infinity"", which also serves as the show\'s OP theme song, is just decent and definitely needs some time to get used to the new Seiyuus\' vocals. I know I will miss Yoshino Nanjo\'s memorable vocals that defined the new age for the group. But the ED, it\'s kinda a meh song that\'s just easy to pass on.I felt on the tip of my mouth to say that I wished that we would\'ve gotten Season 2 of Grimoire of Zero, instead of this barren wasteland of a sequel spin-off that\'s not as enjoyable as the original series. Indeed, Kakeru Kobashiri\'s writing and her lore suffers from an existential crisis of knowing what it wants to be, yet feels like it has to take many steps to reach to the next waypoints in the story plot, so much so that it drags on and on, beckoning the audience to lament of when could we see the story develop faster. If you need any advice on watching this, please just go and watch Grimoire of Zero instead which is better in everything and above all, a good time-waster than this boring mind-numbingness of a canon. White Fox\'s anime adaptation that came and went back in Spring 2017. Since then, it has been exactly half a decade since that show came out, and the sequel spin-off that is Mahoutsukai Reimeiki a.k.a The Dawn of the Witch has some digging into since it\'s a direct canon of the original series that it stems from, mostly for nostalgia reasons.

Indeed, Kakeru Kobashiri\'s writing and her lore suffers from an existential crisis of knowing what it wants to be, yet feels like it has to take many steps to reach to the next waypoints in the story plot, so much so that it drags on and on, beckoning the audience to lament of when could we see the story develop faster. If you need any advice on watching this, please just go and watch Grimoire of Zero instead which is better in everything and above all, a good time-waster than this boring mind-numbingness of a canon.', 'I saw a lot of people complaining about the wrong reasons on this anime, mainly because the story being ""way to fast not explaining anything"" wich I honestly appreciated, since you know, this isn\'t the first show in this universe, there\'s no need to explain everything again, if you want to understand go watch Zero Kara...

So far after the first three episodes I can only said that it lost all benefit of the doubt I had for it. Expected another run of the mill isekai anime but got hit with unispired, poorly made visual novel wannabe with a lot of information just simply cut out and tons of exposition without sense. But lets get to it.Story of Sable startes with scene of something that looks like another world and someone helping person similar to Sable get to another world... and thats main mystery of this anime as to who was...Sable, why this person helped him, we know nothing cause next scene is magic shool and straight exposition - we know nothing of Sable and he is already in trouble for having worst scores in school and has to show at prinicpals office. To not spoil story for anybody wanting to watch it lets summarise that every situation is started and resolved by exposition we cannot do feel anything since everything rushes so fast - all story if told properly would get at least one season worth of plot out from what actually is in 4 episodes (I suppose so since watched only 3 and by the end of 2nd we won with one miniboss, had team fully formed and discovered that one of characters is spy from enemy side and already had change of heart only by having two talks one on one with mc, also we dicovered mc hidden  power, 3rd is fallout from 2nd and journey with more of discovering past and showing another characters to come). So summarising plot is rushed, overexposed and very much is untold so you cant even sympathise with characters despite their potential or even understand them.Art is tragic despite looking so good in stills because its almost fully stills with small fragments moving in 14fps or 3D items moving. I caught characters speaking frames behaving like:P charcaters has mouth, no mouth, back having mouth - is this animation or some kind of joke?

They had some very nice development in their own series, however the first time we see them again, it almost seems like they have gone back to square one. None of their character development seems to show, and they have even become the villains, for no apparent reason (as of yet in episode 4). As a fan of the original Grimoir of Zero this just really ruins the anime for me, as I quite enjoyed those characters, it just doesn\'t sit well with me.None the less, I will most likely still finish the series, and I pray for a good explaination as to why this has happened, maybe it is still saveable.But as for now, this has really disappointed me as a fan of The Grimoir of Zero.After watching it fully, I can confirm that it didn\'t really improve much, so rather than seing it as a successor to Grimoir of Zero, I\'ll just see it as it\'s own slightly below average fantasy anime. typical, for instance with the big boobed girl falling in love with the mc in like episode 3.Where the anime really ticks me off, is again something to do with its characters, and that is how it treats the original characters from ""Grimoir of Zero"".

The story was trying to be better in the third episode but each new episode is just a letdown. The story actually started off kinda interesting but gradually lost me. Every new episode tries to touch a new subject but loses it mid-episode and ends on something else completely. The premise did have a good possibility of an interesting anime but this is just a washed up harem at this point.

He can't control his magic power like others and is almost emotionless. The reason for that is in the middle of the episode where you need to watch it by yourself. After that, He's going to a small village with his new friend and that's where the journey begins.Art (8)The art for this anime is good.

This arcs story isn't that bad nor is it anything special, but it's at least something that was consistent and seemed thought out. I would probably say where it shined most was the character progression of the Tyrant. The big thing I didn't like about this arc is the excessive amount of fan service. Like, can you not with the lolis? Don't get me wrong, they did it with Zero in the first arc too, but it was more...palatable? It served more as a tool for comedy, where...here it was lewdness just for the sake of lewdness. It really feels like they tried to appeal to the super weeby normie crowed with this one, like even in the opening song would be something I'd expect that. Anyway, if you haven't seen Grimoire of Zero, watch that first, and maybe, and that's a big maybe, watch this one.

I only watched for the cameo of everyone\'s favorite white tiger bodyguard, and sadly they changed his voice. Spin-off anime are usually bad in general and this one is no exception. If I had not seen the previous series, I would have jumped shipped after the first two episodes. It\'s frivolous, unoriginal, and aggravating all at the same time. If the generic girl band jpop music in the opening didn\'t clue you in, you are supposed to turn your brain off.The three main characters are ripped straight out of other anime....One is the clueless, unassertive, boyish amnesiac with immense latent power, a la Tower of God. The other is the big boobed, big-eyed, bubbly airhead, like Ochaco from Hero Academia and many others. Third is a lizard demihuman, taken straight from that isekai Slime anime, with the same exact boastful personality. Their backstories are so weak they may as well be one of the background village characters you save in any given episode of a shounen. They are all given tragic childhoods, but the flashbacks are so short and poorly written that the impact becomes insignificant and their characters so devoid of any interesting nuance or development, they are no better than filler side characters. Another one note main character is their chaperone, who is yet ANOTHER overpowered little girl that is hundreds of years old and talks like a granny. This trope is ridiculously tiring at this point.The first two episodes are by far the worst paced and poorly scripted of the lot. It feels like a recap that was poorly edited. No sense of framing or timing or direction. And guess what? That is the height of the suspense. There are zero stakes afterwards. The rest of the show is almost slice of life fare and fanservice. There is more exposition of the universe that the previous series built up, which is sadly far more interesting than the actual story being told. There is not one, not two, but THREE contrived attempts at dramatic conflict sequences. What do I mean by contrived? It means no one is in actual danger and it\'s all a game or a prank. The first one pops up when the main cast meets the cameo cast and is about to be wiped out by them. Even if you didn\'t watch the previous series, you can clearly tell from the opening that these evil villains are part of the good guys and it\'s just a ruse. I was rolling my eyes nonstop. The other two instances are even more ridiculous. It\'s like building a plot based off of trying to fool a toddler that the keys have vanished behind you because toddlers don\'t have a grasp of object permanence yet. Suspense and danger doesn\'t exist. It\'s even a running joke when limbs get lopped off, because they can be instantly healed. The rest of the show is endless fanservice, with boob shots galore bigger than their heads to panty shots to nurses with big glasses getting strangled.If this was a straight up comedy or parody smut-fest it would have been more acceptable. But it\'s one of those shows that both tries to tackle serious topics without being serious, and revels in stupidity instead of fleshing out the main characters. The asinine frivolous plot is better suited for an episode of Scooby-Doo, a mystery series for children, who are easily fooled. It even doubles down on the Saturday morning cartoon conceits, like winning a war with no casualties on either side and a villain that easily capitulates in abject cowardice at the slightest threat. There\'s even a kid with monsters bursting out of his entire torso that magically survives. The ""good buys"" just slice and dice monsters with zero trouble, making quips or taunting each other, much like One Piece or, dare I say, every crappy Marvel movie. You yawn loudly and continously at the lack of struggle or even intelligent strategy or interesting plot twist. The animation and art isn\'t particularly good, especially not the squared off beasts and monsters, some with almost no shins, and the background has this perpetual blur.About the only thing they got right was to rectify the sour taste that I had from the previous series, in which the villain was basically painted as a misunderstood anti-hero who experienced zero fallout from starting multiple wars that killed thousands of people. Is that really the sort of closure you want? He was never punished, or at least it was never addressed in the series. I am not a light novel reader nor care to read up on the rest. In the many lore segments of the spin-off, they vehemently denounce his actions, claiming he is dead, and seem to be making up for their previous huge oversight.

I loved its story, characters, and world building with each episode paced and ended brilliantly--making me eager for more. The reason why I brought this up is because Dawn of the Witch failed to do just that. Despite its premise and the mystery aspect of it, the show's intrigue wore down because of its lack luster pacing. It seemed to randomly end each of...its episodes with random cliffhangers and I personally think certain plot beats and scenes could've been combined together instead of being cut separately to improve the pacing and themes. The characters seemed stuck in one place for far too long, so the way the story was paced made it look like there wasn't any progression at all.This way of pacing also affected the way the characters were portrayed as well. Despite claiming to become close, the show made it look random and unearned compared to the relationships forged by its predecessor. The protagonist felt incredibly bland despite his background and I think the mystery surrounding his circumstances could've been fleshed out more than just saying that it happened to him.That being said, the show has good merits. Its matter-of-fact tone helps portray a witch's way of thinking which in turn creates interesting discussions that made up most of the story. The characters themselves were good at its core despite being held back by its pacing. The comedy and drama were well executed overall, and I still look forward to what these characters will be doing next. The world building is still sold and provides good additions that shows how previous events affected their world after Grimoire of Zero. For instance, the addition to how future Beastfallen are becoming more humanoid due to the distillation of the magic surrounding it was pretty interesting. That being said, I can't help but wonder if that's an excuse for making the female beastfallen look like a conventionally cute anime girl with minimal animal features while the male beastfallen are still hardcore with the animal designs. Overall, the character designs are cute.The production was alright overall. There weren't any memorable soundtracks, but the OP and ED were pleasing.Overall, I think this show is still enjoyable despite its flaws. its episodes with random cliffhangers and I personally think certain plot beats and scenes could've been combined together instead of being cut separately to improve the pacing and themes.

The comedy and drama were well executed overall, and I still look forward to what these characters will be doing next. The world building is still sold and provides good additions that shows how previous events affected their world after Grimoire of Zero. For instance, the addition to how future Beastfallen are becoming more humanoid due to the distillation of the magic surrounding it was pretty interesting. That being said, I can't help but wonder if that's an excuse for making the female beastfallen look like a conventionally cute anime girl with minimal animal features while the male beastfallen are still hardcore with the animal designs. Overall, the character designs are cute.The production was alright overall. There weren't any memorable soundtracks, but the OP and ED were pleasing.Overall, I think this show is still enjoyable despite its flaws."", 'So this a spin off of another series but i am gonna be judiging it on its own.The story is very simple in both its content and overaching plot, it has more SOL than you would expect and not much adventuring, still those cases do not slow it down as it has a nice pacing and some nice mix of action and downtime, with some nice art, decent animation and pretty good music.The characters are certainly the better part as it has good enough characterization along with the nice pacing i mentioned, at the least as much as you can expect from a low stakes...story which ends when it looks like it just started.Overall despite the nice things i say about this and while i enjoyed it, it certainly is not for everyone, as it has  a little above average gore and fanservice moments.I believe this is the type of show you enjoy more when you consume on  a casual basis rather than a must watch anime. story which ends when it looks like it just started.Overall despite the nice things i say about this and while i enjoyed it, it certainly is not for everyone, as it has  a little above average gore and fanservice moments.I believe this is the type of show you enjoy more when you consume on  a casual basis rather than a must watch anime.', ""*Note: May contain spoilers*Story:--------The story is not your typical carbon copy copy/paste, yet a lot seem to hate that suddenly while screaming for something new.

Sometimes it really railed me up that once he have feelings for his professor and after they are parted he don\'t even give a damn.. ""just i wish i could be more with her""... lol If i have to say it MC was the weakest point of this anime but at the other hand they weren\'t making him a hero from a start like some others anime have it where MC is almost instantly perfect but not in this anime.Obviously characters like Kudo,Holdem,Youhei or Zero was saving this anime since you really can\'t expect anything from MC sometimes i had feelings like he is not even MC he is just like that to fill up time and then they removed him since there is not much you can expect from braindead walking body. walking body.

It wasn\'t really bad or anything, but it clearly takes place after a second season that doesn\'t exist."" - said a buddy when I asked him for his opinion on this sequel to Grimoire of Zero, which I also just watched. ""The Dawn of the Witch"" feels like I\'ve cooked it - undercooked, missing salt and it doesn\'t look good either.""The Dawn of the Witch"" is about the young Seville, who has...lost all his memories apart from the last few years. He went to the magic academy, but because of his poor grades he is threatened with expulsion, which would also mean the erasure of his memory. However, an internship in a distant witch village could save him - which, of course, he\'s up for. But to be honest, I don\'t care about the story because it\'s bad.And yet I really tried to like this series. Especially because I just watched ""Grimoire of Zero"" the other day and it\'s definitely one of the best anime out of the ones I\'ve been looking for in the last few months. But unfortunately, there\'s not really anything I can celebrate here.The story is stupid and full of holes. Let\'s start from the beginning, Seville goes on an internship to improve his control over his magic and doesn\'t do it. Or rather, he doesn\'t try the whole time, then spontaneously thinks to himself like ""I should probably be able to do magic as a mage"" and spontaneously learns magic in between episodes?! It was so unsatisfying that Seville could do that all of a sudden AND we didn\'t even really see that step. Plus, he was weak as hell, at least the few times we got to see his magic - which wasn\'t often. Accordingly, that aspect, that goal of the series can be kicked right out the window.But is there any compensation? No. Personally, after a few episodes I just stayed tuned anyway to see what happened to Zero and my fluffy Tija from the original work, but somehow you get more questions served up here than answers. I think that the two of them and maybe Albus are the main reason why someone starts this anime, which is why I hardly comment on it. Only: It\'s best not to watch the series if you\'ve taken such a liking to the cast of ""Grimoire of Zero"", because you won\'t have any fun with ""The Dawn of the Witch"". It feels like a second season is missing, as my buddy also said.Where do I start with all the questions that gave me a headache.... I guess I\'ll just list a few. Why is Zero suddenly running the village? Why does her magic - ten years after everyone lost it, ten years in which all the other witches relearned it - suddenly dry up? What happened to Thirteen? Who is ... (insert 50 names of characters who seem to be well acquainted with Zero and Albus but we\'ve never seen)?Speaking of ""The Dawn of the Witch"" - what\'s with the name? Which witch\'s fate, please? Seville\'s fate? First of all, he\'s a mage - so if anything he\'s a Witcher - and we\'re just seeing him learn magic, he feels even less important than Zero, even though she had less screentime, so what fate?!Edit: A few days later I\'m confused. Wasn\'t ""Dawn"" supposed to be something along the lines of destiny? I could swear it could mean something along those lines - apparently it can be translated as "" departure"", and I guess that\'s where it\'s going. Nevertheless, I still find the name questionable. Probably an allusion to Loux, the ""witch of the dawn"", the name doesn\'t quite stick in my head. So is it about the departure of Seville? Then why ""Witch"", what departure? That he sets off to get to know his past? Then why is there such a strong allusion to Loux here? - I think it\'s getting too much for such a short interlude, so I\'ll stop here.Even if it resonated a bit before, this series feels like the introduction that usually lasts 4 episodes or less. If 5 more seasons come out, I don\'t want to grumble too loudly, but I\'m not expecting it.I\'m also not a fan of the characters at all. Four characters belong to the hero group here, if you want to call them that. Two of them I don\'t like, two I found tolerable or ok.Seville is the protagonist and has the character of a tabletop. Due to certain events, he lost his memory and therefore has trouble expressing and understanding his feelings, which is why he thinks he\'s in love with someone, for example, which he pretty much isn\'t. Such a character is not bad in itself, if he was given some reasonable character development. Instead, he stays that way throughout the 12 episodes - which doesn\'t work in the long run, especially not for a main character. However, you have to give him credit for appearing to have problems with his feelings - which is not the case with many characters who supposedly also have such problems.Holt is Seville\'s obligatory childhood friend - except they\'re not childhood friends. She\'s in love with him for some reason and has a tragic backstory that her friend died during the witch hunt. With various problems in her past, she initially seemed like the most interesting character on the show, but is very quickly killed off and is soon just there to make Seville work somehow - which doesn\'t really work.Kudo is the first character I\'ve found tolerable. He\'s a mercilessly honest lizard who would sacrifice himself for his friends, sometimes just to come off as a hero. He\'s not good and even more poorly realized than Holt, but comes across as more than the obligatory childhood friend, which makes him somewhere sympathetic as a supporting character - also because there were never any expectations placed on him like there were with Holt.Loux is a loli, but in reality she has at least 300 years under her belt. She plays surrogate mother and mentor to her three chicks, as she calls the other three. Although she\'s quite stereotypical with her twisted personality, I liked her best of all. I couldn\'t even really say why. Probably because she was the least annoying and made me laugh once, which was the highlight of the anime.The rest of the cast - UGH. Zero and all the other old favorites are probably the worst, simply because they changed a lot, unnecessarily and without explanation, even in appearance. The tiger looks cuter, which I applaud, but the wolf just changed his color and keeps it in flashbacks - why?!Speaking of appearance - apart from the dubious changes to the character design, I also have to complain about the gore. What was the idea behind making the series so badly exaggerated, unrealistic, brutal and bloody? I don\'t understand it - at first it might distract from the fact that the animation wasn\'t the yellow of the egg, but the characters in this fantasy adventure get their limbs smashed all the time, so that I often sat there and could only grab my head.Conclusion: Could it be that they had problems with the proper second season and therefore simply released the tenth, but had to write it in 10 minutes and animate it in 6? I can\'t explain this fiasco any other way - disregarding the comparison to its predecessor, this series is OK, so it barely gets 4 stars. lost all his memories apart from the last few years.

The story wasn't really interesting, it felt like it was sitting at the same spot, made me skip a couple times only to see my fav characters such as Zero,Youhei. The plot is bland and the main characters aren't exactly even the main characters at all. The only parts like I said had Zero,Youhei,Albus on the screen. It made me so...happy to see how they have matured and changed.I love the fact that Zero and Youhei are married and Youhei feels protective of Zero (So cute!).I only give 6 rating bc of the come back characters.

Students go from place to...place doing some traveling, confronting bad guy etc you know, the basic.The episode where they confronted Zero was almost my breaking point.

They show why he\'s like that in like 20 secs or so and they threw him under some really serious problems to save some childs or whatever.He discovers he\'s a person with emotions and has a breakdown, beautiful.Outside jokes, that moment was so well done, it even caught me by surprise how good that character was done. And that\'s not all, the MC also becomes a real character (how). I love one thing, I\'ll explain.So this MC has a very lame, bad and ass generic backstory (my mother died so I lose emotions yada yada), let that sink in, you cannot change the lame out of the guy.

And when i say gratuitous, i mean theres so much fan service that you will either enjoy it because theres so much or hate it because it's too much. It's not for the faint of hart, trust me. Other than that, Ink and her friends get to deal with some monsters and fight bad guys thats pretty much the gist of the story.Art (Great)Fortunately, the art is something to be believed. The artists did such an amazing work on this show. It's kind of like an anime version of Candyland, with all the bright vibrant colors, large shapes, and cute things. Everything is crisp and clear in high definition. But you will notice (like the theme) that the style might feel a little borrowed from an anime here and an anime there. When I watched it, for some reason it reminded me of Popotan. For others N-Drop. And maybe even a little Kamichama Karin. Point is, that it'll remind you of another show.Sound (Very Good)The sound, like the art quality is very clear and 'magical' as one would expect from a magical girl anime. Complete with their own transformation song/sounds to all the comedy antics one is used to when watching this show. I didn't feel any annoyance toward any sound and I (again) love the OP and ED song of this show. Very happy, catchy little melody with some engrish for some extra kick. The seiyus were all spot on. I can even say that they did a damn good (aka hilarious) job on Moetan Corner. I can watch that segment over and over and its still pretty funny.Character (Good)The magical girl characters are all typical moe branded type girls. But they do add a little 'extra' to them to separate themselves from the rest. For instance, Ink's left (sometimes right) sock always falls down. Sumi's ahoge makes little emoticons to show her emotion which was really cute. And Alice's sidekick is just too much its fantastic. There are other characters around but they're a pretty forgettable bunch, except for the animals. You'll see what i mean if you get a chance to watch it.Enjoyment (Good)Overall if you're all into the &quot;cute moe loli&quot; thing than this show is a barrel of fun. But if you don't like the slightly ecchi loli thing, then try something else. As an acquaintance in a chartroom told me &quot;Its disgusting.&quot; Personally i think what he said was a little overboard. in with some gratuitous fanservice.

It is truly unique, being able to make its viewers react in ways one would not usually react. To me, it has the most brilliant form of parody - it parodies itself. For any parody, one of the main concerns is whether or not the viewers will ""get"" the references thrown at them, but in Moetan, that isn\'t the case. What you see on the screen will be the main subject for amusement, not obscure references that leave half of the viewers in the dark. And that is the really the...main reason why Moetan is considered to be an excellent series to me. You don\'t have a be an otaku or long time anime watcher to enjoy Moetan. All you need is a sense of humor.Story: 8/10This is interesting, because how does one rate the story or plot of a parody/comedy series?  To be straight to the point, Moetan has little plot, none of it relevant in any way to enjoyment.  The real ""plot"" here is for that Arks and Karks have been banished from their world to the human world and they, with the help of magical girls that they choose (Ink and Sumi), will have to collect good deeds in order to return to their world.  However, the real story here is the complete parody of the magical girl genre, especially the transformation sequences, along with the parody of Engrish, ambiguous age of students in anime, flat chests, fanservice, tentacles, Bandai Visual...you name it.  The most spot-on moments of Moetan includes a serious/touching/fanservice moment that just makes you laugh.  There are many panty shots and more explicit near-nudity scenes, but they are presented in a way to be absolutely hilarious.Art: 9/10The art is nothing to complain about.  In fact, the characters are cutely drawn and the transformation sequences have...lots of good detail.  It doesn\'t get a ten because those are reserved to truly animation masterpieces, but for the purposes of this series, the animation was perfect.  There are little things that I personally like, such as the simple ending sequences featuring looking at a window with a character looking out at different phases of the day/season.  It\'s very calm, contrasting the upbeat ending music yet presenting a great mix.  And the character/background switches every episode so it\'s also an extra look into the characters\' daily life.  The final ending sequence for Moetan in episode 13 was just amazing, featuring sketch-like still drawings of Moetan characters, very pretty yet fitting.Sound: 8/10To be honest, I did not pay attention to the background music, which means that it\'s at least mediocre enough to not be out of place but not impressive enough to be noticeable.  However, I will comment on the opening and ending songs, which in my opinion are wonderful.  The OP is fun to watch, and the more you watch Moetan, the more you laugh at its hidden messages.  The ED is catchy and cute, in a way where it\'s too cute that it feels weird to listen to, exactly how I would feel if someone sees me watching the series.  One noticeable moment in music is in episode 13 where the special OVA OP is played near the ending, and it was just very fitting with the battle scene.Character: 8/10Once again, it\'s a parody, so aside from the witty motifs and dark, adult themes, there\'s literally no character development.  Like slice of life series, you get the gist of the ""story"" plus some defining characteristics and personalities of each character, and the comedy builds on them.  What I will say though is that the gags and jokes are not overused and the series always find some new way to make you laugh.Enjoyment: 10/10And here is the main reason why Moetan is one of my favorite series - it is entertainment near its best.  I can go on and on about analyzing every single detail of an anime, but it all comes down to whether or not I enjoyed that anime, and for Moetan, every minute is worth it.  There\'s really nothing else I can say, since you have to watch it to know what I mean.  What I will say is that I spent lots of time laughing along with the characters, and it is one of the few series where I can keep a smile from the beginning of an episode to the end.Overall: 9/10To earn a 9 overall rating, usually the anime has to impact me in some way...until I watched Moetan that is.  Rarely has enjoyment alone been so strong that I am obligated to give the series higher than a 7, but that is exactly the case with this series.  The kinds of anime I like are meaningful series that is deep, but Moetan alone proved that I don\'t need complex plots or drama to be entertained.  Moetan was way outside my comfort side, but somehow it hit at all the right spots.  This is a series I will recommend to everyone (who feels comfortable laughing at semi-nudity scenes), because if it can make a tough analyst like me wholeheartedly enjoy it, then it can probably do the same for you too. main reason why Moetan is considered to be an excellent series to me.

And I mean perfect, filled to the brim with great laughs, carefully designed character archetypes, and a plethora of nosebleed moments. Character design by POP, best character designer to grace the medium.This series definitely has it's priorities straight. It doesn't beat around the bush trying to saturate itself with some sort of semblance of storyline depth, and doesn't waste any time trying to feed you some crap about emotional complexities of characters. It gets right to the point: cute girls, laughs, panties, charming moments, and plenty of one piece swimsuits. Even...while lacking a focus on depth of character, Ink still ends up being one of my favorite anime characters, the stereotypes are done in a good way. Ink is your typical altruistic but clumsy magical girl, and that's what makes her cute. Sumi is your typical dumb bratty self-centered loli, and it's perfect. Easily has among the best transformation sequences in the mahou shoujo genre. Also has an 11/10 ED track, and really good specials that don't leave you feeling disappointed. while lacking a focus on depth of character, Ink still ends up being one of my favorite anime characters, the stereotypes are done in a good way.

There was a lot of ecchiness and near pornographic transformation scenes. Although, the show was comedy oriented, I didn't find myself laughing my ass off (LMAO) or anything like that. Quite frankly it was pretty bland, but there were a few good moments here and there filled with moe.The story is centered around a girl named Ink. She some how coincidentally found her way to becoming a magical girl who must...help people. But her sense of helping people is helping a boy she has a crush on with his English studies. And that's mainly it, the plot gets a little thicker a little down the line, but it isn't anything really noting. (That should probably tell you how well thought out this show was).The characters felt really shallow, as if there wasn't very much character build up. We learn very little about the characters past, which is the reason why I felt so detached to the characters. All of the magical people from another world are very perverted to the point they should practically be in jail. The only really deep thing about Ink's and  Sumi's past is about their friendship and why they both like cats. Other than that, it is pretty much something you could've figured out on your own without an entire episode dedicated to that memory.The music suited the mood and the actions the characters were doing, but I am pretty impressed with the English dialogue. Nao, the main character who is supposed to learn English, never actually speaks it, so I found that kind of ironic.The art is very MOE. Almost everything about it is supposed to be moe. Little girls with no female features is apparently awesome in Japan... That is a cultural divide for me. Anyway, I was unimpressed with how the artists would repeat the exact same scenes, two, three and sometimes four times. It felt like there was a really big budget cut, so they took short cuts in a few places, and you'll notice them when/if you watch the show. And for some reason, frilly and complex costumes are impressive in Japan... it's no wonder that you need magic in order to put on these extremely complex clothes like that.Other than a few things, I guess I can say that I enjoyed the show a little bit. It felt more like a waste of time rather than something I had to watch to satisfy my curiosity. There was good moments here and there, but the ecchiness was mainly involved with the little girls with no feminine features. Looking at naked little girls is practically no different from looking at naked little boys. help people. But her sense of helping people is helping a boy she has a crush on with his English studies.

This may well be the stupidest magical girl anime in existence (unless you consider Dokuro-chan a mahou shoujo) but that\'s precisely why I find it so funny. Let\'s take a look at why this is one of my favorite pieces of trash.Story 4/10A loli-loving man from a parallel universe gets banished from his world and turned into a duck so that he can help a high school senior that looks half as old as she actually is teach people English by...turning into a magical girl. This is the level of stupidity that is so stupid it transcends being stupid and loops back into pure brilliance. Pure. Fucking. Brilliance.Characters 7/10The characters were able to make me laugh pretty consistently, it takes a good set of characters to pull off stupid comedy and have it actually be funny. Both the side characters (some of whom are more or less just gag characters) and main characters do well in delivering the show\'s humor.Art 5/10Moetan features low-budget moeblob art and animation. Honestly, I think low budget art can make a comedy funnier when done right, especially a stupid one like this as it adds a further pinch of stupidity to the stupidness with its low-budget-y-ness.Sound 5/10Pretty unremarkable but fitting for the show. You also get to hear some Engrish! (actually not half bad compared to the Engrish in some anime, maybe even sometimes good enough to be called English!)Enjoyment 8/10This is the only category that matters for a comedy really (well this and maybe characters) and Moetan nailed it here. I laughed my ass off at this show as it continued to be stupid and random in unexpected and hilarious ways. Yes, there are a lot of stupid and random comedies out there and a lot of them aren\'t funny. To a lot of people, Moetan won\'t be funny, but for me it just hit that sweet spot as that special kind of trash I really love.Overall 8/10 (Excellent)Do you like really stupid comedy (think Aho Girl, Dokuro-chan, Kill Me Baby)? Do you like cutesy magical girl shows? If you answered ""yes"" to both those questions, watch Moetan. If you answered ""yes"" to just one, maybe give it a try. If you answered ""no"" to both questions, this anime isn\'t worth your time.As much as I\'ve said ""stupid"" and ""trash"" in this review though, I can\'t stress enough that I really did love this show. There\'s stupid stupid and brilliant stupid and which is which varies from person to person based on their tastes, but for me Moetan is that brilliant kind of stupid. It definitely ain\'t for everyone though! turning into a magical girl. This is the level of stupidity that is so stupid it transcends being stupid and loops back into pure brilliance. Pure. Fucking.

I tried to keep this short and straight to the point.This review is spoiler-free!Alright, I have to admit: this was partially my fault. I knew this was tagged as ecchi, a genre I greatly dislike, but I still gave it a shot anyways. I’m not going to deny that.However, I don’t think that excuses this anime from being so unbelievably gross. You can try to convince me all you want by saying “but Ink’s 17!” but I think that fact only makes me dislike this anime even more. She looks like a child AND she acts like a child. Lewding her...like that pervert duck I won’t bother to name by slapping some random age on her doesn’t make it any better.I guess some people like the comedy aspect of it…? I don’t know. I didn’t find it funny, perhaps because I was too disgusted by the unnecessary angles they wouldn’t stop focusing on to notice anything else.The only reason I didn’t quit watching it after the first five minutes was because I am a curious person, and I was hoping that at least the plot or the character’s personalities would make up for the sickening parts. Unsurprisingly, they didn’t. That’s why I dropped it so early on.And it’s a shame, really. The concept seemed cute; it was just very poorly executed.Honestly, I don’t see anyone enjoying this except for lolicons. So, if you’re into that, go ahead and watch it. Just stay far away from me please.Anyways, I think I went on a bit of a rant there, and I apologize for that. Thank you so much for reading and bye-bye! like that pervert duck I won’t bother to name by slapping some random age on her doesn’t make it any better.I guess some people like the comedy aspect of it…?

The first version shown is the review with the spelling mistakes corrected and the second is the original review.As an anime about being bad at speaking English I shall be typing this review without looking at the keyboard. I personally found this anime to be enjoyable, but then again I do like lolis which are a main draw to this show.The story is about Ink-chan or whatever her civilian name was and her goal to make her love interest her boyfriend. She does this by becoming a magical girl and teaching him Engrish. As Western viewers...it sounds funny to hear this. This was adapted from a book trying to teach people how to speak English the otaku way, but it had a lot of problems so it had to be revised. This anime similarly has a lot of problems. The whole concept of the show doesn’t make sense and the two mentor character are pedophiles.The animation is done fairly well for this kind of show. The characters look really cute and their transformation scenes were done well. I liked the modern touch that they use cell phones to transform. The lolis look adorable in both of their forms and the males don’t look too shabby either. Don’t question why they look like that when they’re 17.The voice acting is obviously cute considering what this show is. The opening theme is quite catchy. The glaring problem with the sound is the fact that the English doesn’t sound like English. The examples they use don’t make sense in the West and the way they pronounce them is way off as well. It is very much an Engrish anime.The characters themselves have logical aspirations, although not the most logical ways of getting them. The two animal characters aren’t very likeable. The two lolis have more of cute personalities than anything and they could be more developed.Despite all of the flaws I really enjoyed this anime. I find Engrish to be cute so having an entire anime about it is great. I also really liked Ink’s design when transformed.Overall this is a pretty average anime, but if you like stupid anime or want something to watch with a friend to make fun of this could be a good choice.Original review:As an anime oabout being bad at speeaking English I shall be typing this review without looking at the keyboard.

The characters look really cute and their transformation scenes were done well. I liked the modern touch that they use cell phones to transform. The lolies look adorable in both of their forms and the males don’t look too shabby either. Don’t quention why they look like that when they’re 145.The voice acting is obviously cute considering what this show is. The opening theme is quite catchy. The glaring problem with the sound is the fact that the English doesn’t sound like English. The examples they use don’t make sense in the West andthe way they pronouce them is way off as well. It is very much an Engrish anime.The characters themselves have logical aspirations, although not the most logical ways of tgetting them. The two anime characters aren’t very likable. The two lolis have more of cute personalies than anything and they could be more developed.Despite all of the flaws I really enjoyed this anime. I find Engrish to be cute so having an entire anime about it is great. I also really liked Ink’s design when transformed.Overall this is a pretty average anime, but if you like stupid anime or want something to watch with a friend to make fun of this could be a good choice.', ""Story: 7/10 The history is ok, it thus make sense. The couples have a good develop and the topic of the episodes are funny and good. The anime give a lot of examples, things that make we learn in the life.Art: 10/10 The feature is very cute.

I appreciate the animation style and the combination of different textures used throughout the scenes. Despite being released in 2023, the anime gives me nostalgic vibes similar to older animes and cartoons I\'ve seen before. (Manga came out in 2007/2008) The simplicity of the backgrounds, props, and effects adds to the cozy atmosphere while watching.When comparing the manga to the anime, I wish there were a bit more decorative and visual effects in the animation.

One of the things I have to absolutely praise is the sound in this ONA. The voice acting is cute as hell for the main character, the choice of some tracks (and some images) is very curious and clearly influenced by popular media and memes. It...kinda gave me the thought that the people making this ONA had a lot of fun doing so.Speaking of the animations, I have to say I love them. I don't really know how I would describe them, but the closest adjective I can think of is cute. Now, this might be because of the images themselves, not the animations, however, I stand my ground here.All in all, I have to say this is an absolutely brilliant, short little series that I have enjoyed watching.

Yes, there are some ""questionable"" scenes that the OVA had, (2 in particular), but in a given episode of the series compared to this OVA, there\'s actually not that much which is rather surprising.  (This deduction is due to the fact that I\'ve seen quite a few OVA\'s with fanservice galore since the writers seemed to be holding back in the original series\'.)For music, well, it\'s the same old same old.

With Saikin\'s reputation for being #1, an incest series, #2, a fanservice series, and #3, a show that left quite a few gaping plot holes and somewhat bland characters, I more or less expected this OVA to be just pure fanservice with every one of its female characters at least stripped to their underwear.  Surprisingly enough, I didn\'t get that.  (THANK GOD)Instead though, I got an OVA that focused a little more on family, than on fanservice.  (Though, seeing a few scenes in this was still to be expected.)

Some people felt it was the best lite hearted series to come around in a long time, while others felt it came off a bit too moe and simplistic for its own good. I have to say up front that I really enjoyed the first season of K-ON! It mixed well the music themes with a nice easy to get into story. Unfortunately not so much with these specials though. They are, well, they’re a little thin.These specials feel exactly like what it says in the title...a special. Being that the episodes only last roughly two...to three minutes, fans might be surprised that most of the episodes are split into about 3 parts an episode. Meaning that each skit lasts only about a minute or less. Sometimes they lead into one another, while other times they differ completely from the last scene. The skits remain quite random, and gone is the music theme the series set. Now we see the characters caught up in more random situations. Whether it be Yui thinking random thoughts about the cast, to the band being stranded on a deserted island, to watching them build a snowman in the winter. As expected they are all episodic, and don’t build on anything for the series future. I think the reason I was dissapointed with these, is because they remained a bit too bland in their approach. The situations they are in are not particularly as interesting as you would expect from K-ON!, making these feel more like a side attempt. Now some may argue that these are only 2 minute specials, and that they aren’t suppose to be particularly deep. While this is true, I still feel at the same time it could have been handled better.Most people will probably hate the art style in these. While I can give them credit that they did stylized the look of K-ON! to some degree, the character design in this is quite poor. The characters are drawn very simplistic, with round hands, and under detailed backgrounds. It looks like something a 2nd grade student would make in their art session. I don’t mind simplicity, but this was a bit too much.The sound I enjoyed quite a bit in this, which is rightfully so being that the franchise has a music theme. Although there is no opening theme to these, they use tracks for the actual anime, and the ending credits are fast paced and exciting. You even get some catchy bloops and bleeps in the background. The voice acting is also well done, all actresses came back to fill their appropriate roles. They’re cute, charming, and fun to listen to.Surprisingly, I did feel the characters retained their personalities from the series, which will make these feel very familiar to their fans. Yui and Ui are still sweet, Mio is still as shy as ever, and even Azusa makes appearances here. Really that’s what made up for some of the short comings the specials had, with the actual characters. If you loved them before, I think you will like them in these as well.Being that these specials are so short, I think fans should check them out. Overall, if you are in fact a hardcore K-ON! fan, then you will get some enjoyment from these. If you aren’t one, then you may want to skip these, and watch the OVA and/or wait for the second season of K-ON! to premiere. to three minutes, fans might be surprised that most of the episodes are split into about 3 parts an episode. Meaning that each skit lasts only about a minute or less. Sometimes they lead into one another, while other times they differ completely from the last scene. The skits remain quite random, and gone is the music theme the series set. Now we see the characters caught up in more random situations. Whether it be Yui thinking random thoughts about the cast, to the band being stranded on a deserted island, to watching them build a snowman in the winter. As expected they are all episodic, and don’t build on anything for the series future. I think the reason I was dissapointed with these, is because they remained a bit too bland in their approach. The situations they are in are not particularly as interesting as you would expect from K-ON!, making these feel more like a side attempt. Now some may argue that these are only 2 minute specials, and that they aren’t suppose to be particularly deep. While this is true, I still feel at the same time it could have been handled better.Most people will probably hate the art style in these. While I can give them credit that they did stylized the look of K-ON! to some degree, the character design in this is quite poor. The characters are drawn very simplistic, with round hands, and under detailed backgrounds. It looks like something a 2nd grade student would make in their art session. I don’t mind simplicity, but this was a bit too much.The sound I enjoyed quite a bit in this, which is rightfully so being that the franchise has a music theme. Although there is no opening theme to these, they use tracks for the actual anime, and the ending credits are fast paced and exciting. You even get some catchy bloops and bleeps in the background. The voice acting is also well done, all actresses came back to fill their appropriate roles. They’re cute, charming, and fun to listen to.Surprisingly, I did feel the characters retained their personalities from the series, which will make these feel very familiar to their fans. Yui and Ui are still sweet, Mio is still as shy as ever, and even Azusa makes appearances here. Really that’s what made up for some of the short comings the specials had, with the actual characters. If you loved them before, I think you will like them in these as well.Being that these specials are so short, I think fans should check them out. Overall, if you are in fact a hardcore K-ON! fan, then you will get some enjoyment from these. If you aren’t one, then you may want to skip these, and watch the OVA and/or wait for the second season of K-ON! to premiere.', ""These little specials are basically random short silly storylines, either told by the story or the characters.

Kagewani,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30524/Kagewani,"['In one line : A hommage to the old horror genre.Initial expectation :I always had bad experiences so far with 7 minutes long Animes. Those encountered were always rushed, senseless or ridiculous and build around fanservice, so I had the tendency to avoid them. When I came across Kagewani, I wanted to test it out not only for its unique art style, but because it was tagged as horror.Story :What struck me with the very first episode is the mastering of the pacing. Writing a scheme properly within mere 7 minutes isn\'t as simple as it may sound. On the contrary, to settle down...every key points properly, without rushing it, to have a slow build up that brings you to the tension point, isn\'t at all something I would have ever thought doable in so little time. And yet they succeed at 13 times in a row. Just for that I give them a giant cookie.But then, I can understand why this type of pacing would be frustrating for others. Slow pacing and 7 minutes might appear contradictory.The stories, separately aren\'t exceptional, but they use the ancient codes and tropes of horror properly. (I say ""ancient"", because, no, modern horror doesn\'t work the same way and modern vs ancient expectations are easy to tend to clash together) Together, however, yes, they do bear a sort of ""brilliance"" by reusing and reactualizing various types of fears (among one single spectrum : monsters/creatures of legends/folklore), each episode focusing on one specifically.Another thing worthy to note is the execution of the iconisation and gigantism of the various monsters. In a time where proper iconisation seems to be rare, Kagewani, is once again, able to do it 13 times.My only real regrets with this show is how, with the last episode, it shifts from horror to supernatural, but I remain curious to see the rest.Art :Do you know the word ""grotesque"" ? No, not in the ""ridiculous"" meaning - though the art plays against the show in the first episodes with ridiculous animations which discredit the tension of the show ; thankfully, it improves through the episodes - the style, more specifically when coming to monsters. I won\'t give you a definition, looking at the show is the quickest way for you to know.Combined with this style you can find two other styles : drawn-over photographies and more classical drawings.The animation is an in-between anime and manga (there isn\'t any illusion of movements like you would usually find in an anime, but it isn\'t static as in a manga). Be it the presence of three distinctive styles or the animation, it can be rather repelling or create a certain dissonance. Ironically enough, it only participates as a reinforcement of horror. Well, ancient horror.Characters :In that aspect....having a 7 minutes long show is rather smart. It doesn\'t try developing its characters, and it isn\'t the slightest necessary for what it is attempting to be nor should it as it would be an incredible loss of time for something so short.A single chara is attempted to be more fleshed out, the recurrent Banba Sousuke (that name is ridiculous XD). There\'s nothing much to say about it. It occurs later in the show and there\'s very little offered in the end. Only the next season, if it comes out, can give a more valid view but even then, too much shouldn\'t be expected, not in a negative way, but by simply remembering in front of what you are.Overall :The people who did this had guts. Daring producing an old-fashioned horror fiction with such a different art style is a bet in itself, reuniting with ""horror"" and ""grotesque"" in their primal forms. Sadly, if we consider its rather low reception, they partly lost it. Which, in my opinion is a shame, but at the same time, not surprising. I can only wish for them to have just enough success to make a sequel or to be more precise, that the sequel won\'t be cancelled.I am aware this review has a rather formal approach of the show, but I felt it was necessary to bring it some justice ; and it was the form that entertained me the most. every key points properly, without rushing it, to have a slow build up that brings you to the tension point, isn\'t at all something I would have ever thought doable in so little time.

It\'s not the most ""enthralling"" thing out there, but for the sake of offering cheap thrills, some goosebump moments, and something to whet the appetite, I think it serves its purpose well in pop culture. Kagewani is a title that pretty much follows this rubric down to the letter. It isn\'t going to ""waw"" you with any pioneering ideas, nor will it find itself in your coveted ""top 10 favorites"" list. Instead, what this ""animated"" short offer is a fairly decent time-passer, serving as an intermission break...before you take on the next show that you truly want to watch.Told in a quasi-memoir like structure, the story of Kagewani was comprised of a series of anthology-like fables, where we find ourselves following Sousuke Banba, a scientist (or better yet, a supernatural detective), as he investigates the trail of carnage left behind by mysterious monsters that populate Japan. Sharing a personal life-altering encounter with these monsters, a majority of the story was dedicated to not only putting an end to the monsters\' destruction but also exploring the backstory of Banba as well.The first thing that would immediately grab your attention is the uncommon art-style that Kagewani incorporates. Similar to another occult mystery anime, Yami Shibai, the art-style is akin to that of cardboard cutout paper-mache collages. Images that move across the screen like a puppeteer pulling strings. In most cases, this type of art-style may feel out of place, but for an anthology series that basically uses folklore to tell tales of strange happenings across Japan, the choice is perfectly at home. It gives everything an ominous vibe, a type of uncanny valley effect to the way everything moves and looks,  which helps compensate for the lack of atmosphere not allotted to it otherwise. Of course, you\'ll have those individuals that immediately say that the show ""is shit"" for not following convention, but for those who like anime that diversify its style and art direction, it can serve as a unique entry. It isn\'t bad, just different.Another noteworthy thing is the monster design themselves; borrowing elements European fairy tales and merging it with Japanese kaiju designs to create interesting hybrids. As in the case of the art-style, these ugly monstrosities help out where the audiovisual output was lacking.Surprisingly enough, the music selection was virtually nonexistent. Outside of a few sparse sound effects here and there, and the ending theme song itself, there was very little here of note. Usually, shorts like these utilize music to help build its atmosphere, so seeing how little Kagewani took advantage of this chance to really up the creep factor was a bit disappointing.But this wasn\'t a series I really had much investment in, to begin with, so not like it mattered all that much.While it had its issues and doesn\'t go beyond being a novelty act, Kagewani did well enough under the time restraint and limited material it had to work with. It\'s not a title that you will probably remember in the long run, but I say it\'s still worth a try. It\'s short, to the point, and gets the job done, and at the end of the day, that\'s all that really matters. before you take on the next show that you truly want to watch.Told in a quasi-memoir like structure, the story of Kagewani was comprised of a series of anthology-like fables, where we find ourselves following Sousuke Banba, a scientist (or better yet, a supernatural detective), as he investigates the trail of carnage left behind by mysterious monsters that populate Japan.

You’ll probably watch Kagewani while eating something or doing something else. However as a mystery Kagewani isn’t really that mysterious, and as a horror it’s not quite scary either. However it manages to be a decent way of spending your time if you have nothing else to do.~{Story}~Kagewani is pretty much a monster-of-the-week type anime series. Each episode focuses on some humans, they get attacked by monsters or cryptids, and they either survive the attack or not. The series is episodic,...however the overall story is about Banba, a professor, who comes at the end of every problem for the first half of the series to do, well, nothing! But by the second half, the story starts connecting the cases together to find the overall truth of these monsters… well sort of. Most of the stories presented in this anime end up to be decent. It does use some horror clichés, however it does work well in this anime. The final arc by far is the one that intrigues the most, as it focuses on Banba. However, this anime felt very incomplete as it manages to leave more questions unanswered than answered. The ending makes you want more, not because you enjoyed it, but because you’re about to enjoy it. When it gets interesting, the anime ends, which is a shame.Story: 5/10~{Presentation}~Kagewani is a short anime series, as each episode is only 7:50 mins, so it never feels like you are wasting your time. Also, monster-of-the-week format does have you wondering what they’ll present next. The production values in the anime aren’t much at all. As a horror, it’s not really scary, but it does have some creepy moments. The anime does a good job in making a proper atmosphere for its stories. As a mystery, it’s not really mysterious. The “secret” of the monsters aren’t really that special, nor intriguing. However, as a short series, it does its job as a tea break.Presentation: 6/10~{Character}~As an episodic series, ever episode focuses on different characters, so no proper character development can actually take place. However, the characters that are present end up being doing the job well as they aren’t as generic as they may seem. In some stories, it might be the typical, helpless victim, but in other stories, characters are shown to be strong-minded. There is technically one protagonist in the series, Banba Sousuke, a professor who studies these monsters and pops up at the end of some stories to either help victims, or to investigate cases. His backstory ends up being somewhat well done for a short series.Character: 5.5/10~{Art}~,The art style is quite unique, as it has this cardboard-cutout look to it. If I would compare the art to anything it would probably be Inferno Cop, however, Kagewani’s art actually looks like as if some effort was actually put into it. The art style is pretty detailed, and the cardboard look does look nice. One thing that is worth mentioning is that the art design for the monsters are great. Some of them end up looking very creepy and very well detailed. Character designs in this anime are decent.Art: 7/10~{Animation}~There isn’t really much to say about the animation in Kagewani as its cardboard style animation prevents it from it looking smooth or neat. Characters move weirdly, use of depth isn’t proper, characters limbs feel weird. At times, it just feels plain distracting. It could have had better animations, even with that art style.Animation: 2.5/10~{Voice Acting}~Kagewani has a lot of characters, though most of their seiyuu cast information is pretty hard to find. Most of the characters voice acted pretty well, as they manage to use good enough emotions for their part. Sugita Tomokazu, is a well acclaimed seiyuu, does Banba pretty well. Though he has the most demanding script in the series, it still isn’t much. Okiayu Ryotaro does Kimura pretty well too. Overall the voice acting in the anime ends up decent.Voice Acting: 7/10~{Music}~The anime doesn’t have any OP, however it has an ED, which is used for the last five seconds of each episode. The ED, “Arrival of Fear” is pretty decent as it has some catchiness to it. The sound effects for the monsters are okay. However the background music, which should play a fundamental part to a horror series, ends up feeling lacking. It doesn’t build up suspense whatsoever.Music: 5/10~{Enjoyment}~Watching this anime didn’t feel like it was hurting me as it was 8 mins per week. It was a good enough anime to watch while I was eating a snack or two. The anime lacks suspense and it isn’t really scary at all. However, its unique art style and monster designs and Sugita Tomokazu’s voice made things more enjoyable than it should be.Enjoyment: 5/10Kagewani should really be watched if you have nothing good to do or you want to watch something short. However with its art and monster designs and its length, it manages to become bearable. If you’re here for scares and thrills, don’t expect too much as the poor animations and lack of proper background music can halt your experience. Overall, Kagewani isn’t an anime that would be remembered at all as it is strictly average.+ Unique cardboard-cutout art style and well designed monsters+ Surprisingly nice backstory for Banba, and Banba as a character is interesting.+ Voice acting was pretty good with Sugita Tomokazu doing justice to his part.- Not really scary, nor really thrilling- Some story cases were misses, and the “ending” is unsatisfying.- Awkward animations, especially character movements.Overall: 5.4/10 however the overall story is about Banba, a professor, who comes at the end of every problem for the first half of the series to do, well, nothing!

However, it does feel like it ups its execution for every episode afterward, ultimately becoming a net positive experience for fans of this particular sub-genre.The animation (which could be aptly described as something like motion comic) eventually gets easier on the eyes, along with...the choreography. There's enough variety of setting, beasts, and the way the characters react and try to outsmart them in each vignette to maintain my interest and keep me on the edge of my seat. I'm also satisfied by the level of storyboarding overall, with most episodes making effective use of its 7-minute runtime. The atmosphere is spot on, the many voice actors sound appropriately tense/frightened/determined, and suspense tends to be nicely built up leading to the climactic money shots—the definitive moments of the series where the camera reveals the featured beast in its full glory and monstrosity.I may have fallen from my seat a few times while watching. Maybe it’s just the creaky chair, though.The show's format does make the attempt at overarching plot suffer a bit. Main character Sousuke Banba and his mysterious vibrating scar don't really have anything interesting to do until around the last three episodes or so, and there are times when the end of an episode doesn't transition well to the next one plot-wise. The ending itself is pretty nice, although it also left a few questions hanging in the air and tantalizing tease for a second season (which I'm not sure is coming, but I'm hopeful).Kagewani's a definite recommendation for anyone with slightest interest in kaijuu/cryptids/mythical monsters, and it's also worth a few episodes' try for others who wouldn't be scared away by its general format and animation style. the choreography.

The ending itself is pretty nice, although it also left a few questions hanging in the air and tantalizing tease for a second season (which I'm not sure is coming, but I'm hopeful).Kagewani's a definite recommendation for anyone with slightest interest in kaijuu/cryptids/mythical monsters, and it's also worth a few episodes' try for others who wouldn't be scared away by its general format and animation style."", ""Welcome, to the start of horror anime month. Where most of the series I review will undoubtedly have the horror tag, not because they're scary in any way, but because they have monsters. Kagewani is a thirteen episode series that was written by Kumamoto Hiromu and brought to us by Tomovies. You may not recognise the studio name and wonder what else they've done. Well, there's this and its currently airing sequel. That's it. The studio is really new. How does their initial venture into anime production hold up? Let's take a look.Story:Kagewani follows Professor Judas Traveller*, a crypto-zoologist. You probably think of cryptozoology as...that field where a bunch of people with no credibility waste time trying to find fictional creatures which it is, in reality. But this is a work of fiction and, in the world of Kagewani, those fictional creatures actually exist. Virtually every episode covers a different encounter someone has with a cryptid while Judas observes or listens to the story without actually contributing anything, except for a few isolated cases where he actually does something.The biggest issue with Kagewani is that it attempts to be suspenseful horror but it fails miserably on both accounts. Each episode is under eight minutes long and they cover different cases, which doesn't allow for any suspense to be built up. We also see the monsters right away in most episodes, which is also detrimental to the suspense. The horror aspects also fail. Most of it is just based around goofy looking monsters chasing people we know nothing about and don't have any investment in seeing come out okay. We also have an underlying story about the titular kagewani and it fails about as badly as the one-shot stories. The series also suffers from characters gaining knowledge they shouldn't have. The big example being the wampa*1 episode and the person its chasing escaping because she somehow knows how its vision works. I guess she looked at the script.About the best thing I can say about the series is that it's actually kind of funny. It's like Corpse Party or Galerians in that it's so egregiously incompetent that a lot of the “horror” moments just come across as laughable. If the series was a deliberate parody of B horror films, it would actually be pretty decent.*Yes, I know that isn't his actual name but it amuses me to call him that.*1 I know it's really supposed to be a yeti, but either one is fictional so it doesn't really matter.Characters:The characters are a big part of why the series fails. In order for suspense horror to work, we as the audience need to have some level of investment in the characters and their well being. In this series we get thirty seconds with a character, if that long, before they're being chased by some monster or other. None of them come across as complex, interesting or fleshed out. We don't care what happens to them because they're like the generic background characters with no real personality that show up once from an action-oriented shounen series that runs for hundreds of episodes. Judas Traveller isn't any better. He's just a generic obsessed dude who's mostly relegated to the background where he can watch events unfold without actually contributing to them. The Precure they added in Max Heart was more developed as a character and she was the very model of a modern mundane magical girl.Art:The art is a big reason for the series' unintentional comedy. It's at Spider-man and his Amazing Friends levels of the studio just not caring. The animation is janky. The characters look like badly made paper dolls. The posing is frequently really unnatural. Did the studio literally give every episode the animation budget of a convenience store boxed lunch?Sound:The performances in this are quite flat. I can't really blame the actors. They cast some good ones. I think the problem really does stem from the characters being duller than the original characters in a bad fanfic. The music isn't very good. It's not badly done, but it's just kind of weak.Ho-yay:There isn't any. Having ho-yay would necessitate that the characters have strong enough interactions and personalities for chemistry. Which they don't.Final Thoughts:Kagewani is an incompetent series. Like Galerians and Corpse Party, it fails miserably at what it's actually trying to do. But, like those series, I kind of recommend it for the unintentional humour. Still, I have to give it a 2/10. Next week we'll continue this year's horror anime month with Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibougamine Gakuen Mirai-hen & the sequel special Kibou-hen. Look forward to that and maintain your fabulousity. that field where a bunch of people with no credibility waste time trying to find fictional creatures which it is, in reality.

Shows like Ninja Slayer, Inferno Cop and even Ping Pong The Animation could be considered abnormal, because the artstyle and animation is not like every harem/ecchi ROMCOM in existence.Kagewani is one of those rare and delightful chances we as viewers get to experience, when things start to get experimental in the anime business. Since it\'s new and fresh, a lot of people tend to dislike it immediately, because it doesn\'t look or act as ""normal"" anime would.""Uhh! The animation sucks and the art is shitty! Where\'s my ecchi/harem light novel adaptation...#43679?""A lot of viewers say that when they stumble across shows like the ones previously mentioned. You don\'t need to have flashy explosions, fluid animation or boobs to make a good anime. You just need an interesting story or alternative artstyle to grab the viewers attention. Kagewani has both.Story: 6/10Mysterious monsters and exotic creatures are starting to show up dangerously close to human cities. Sousuke Banba (Voiced by Gintoki from Gintama) is a strange man with an even stranger scar, investigating the deaths surrounding the monsters.With the short runtime of 6 minutes per episode (if you remove the OP and ED), Kagewani manages to:- Set the tone and environment of the episode (Jungle, Mountains, Sea, Urban)- Introduce the potential victims- Show the actually creepy/scary monsters in action- Tell us a little more about Sousuke BanbaThe first 9 episodes are a ""monster of the week"" type of show, but some actual story is introduced in the last quater of the show.Art: 7/10This is the first ""drop point"" for a lot of people. The art is... special.Think of Angela Anaconda. The animation for Kagewani is very cutout-esque. The animation is mostly made of the limbs ""moving"" back and forth, while the background moves. It also have some real life pictures with a filter laid over in it as well. It\'s incredibly hard to describe...If you compare the animation in Kagewani with ANY anime (excluding Inferno Cop and Ninja Slayer) it would look bad in comparison. But i think the animation is one of the strong points of the show. The animation and artstyle is dark, eerie, creepy and gritty. It fits the tone of the show.Sound: 7/10The voice actors do a decent job, but the thing that really shines is the ambient noises and the cries of the monsters.When walking in the sewers, you hear small dripping noises, the water gently hitting the brick wall and some very faint and distant stomping that\'s gradually getting closer and closer and closer. When climbing the mountain, you can hear the snow crackle under the boots, the wind howling and the sound of carabiners hitting each other in the belt.Character: 5/10The only reoccurring character is Sousuke Banba, which we know very little about. He\'s a professor at a university (which is never brought up again), he has a secretary (which is never brought up again...) and the scar on his face hurt whenever he gets close to monsters. He had a traumatic childhood and i would be spoiling the show if i told any more about Sousuke Banba.Unfortunately, every other character falls flat. There\'s a few characters in the last quarter of the show that actually are important to the story, but the anime ended before they could even tell us why they were important to the story.Enjoyment: 7/10It\'s the first anime with the ""horror"" tag that actually have made me scared. The incredibly unnerving atmosphere and downright disgusting monsters is a breath of fresh air from the Light Novel ecchi harem copy paste shows that has been rolling out faster than the Russian T-34 tank during World War 2.Overall: 6/10Before even watching Kagewani, ask yourself:""How am i going to watch/enjoy this show?""DON\'T assume that the art is what\'s going to keep you here.

I entered the first episode laughing at the art style and 7-minute episodes but by the end of it all, I found everything that makes this show what it is, somewhat charming and lovable. Compound that with a genuinely interesting story and a main character (who despite his plot armour) has a unique backstory and straight up bizarre monsters, and you end up with a show that may just be worth...your time.

If you like wolf/fox girls as well, Kanokon is a show you probably want to watch.The premise is basic, and not really original. The &quot;hot&quot; girl (Chizuru), who also happens to be a fox spirit, is totally in love with the most lady-shy boy (Kouta) around. Then another one comes (Nozomu), she is a wolf spirit at that, and guess what? She happens to love him too. They both fight for his attention with a lot of ecchi antics, and the rest I'll leave to your imagination...The story itself...is pretty much an episode-by-episode story; there's not a lot of stuff that binds the episodes together. The ecchi-ness isn't lacking; Chizuru and Nozomu's ecchi-filled attempts at winning Kouta's affection comes out of nowhere sometimes, and if you're a fan of it, you'll more than likely enjoy it..The animation wasn't all that; everyone looked much younger than they actually are - Kouta looks like he's an elementary school student when he's actually a high school student. That has its impact on the overall feel of the show (ecchi + people who looks like elementary school students = bad combination), but you'll probably get used to it. At least I did. Aside that, the animation quality is fair enough.The soundtrack is average, nothing spectacular, but nothing out of place either.

First off, this is a ""love it, or hate it"" anime. Those who can withstand the ecchiness will love it, else they\'ll find it very annoying or to some extend even disgusting (repulsive is the word I am getting at...). It is plainly obvious that the anime is targeting the MALE audience. Yes girls, this anime is NOT FOR YOU! With that in mind, we\'ll proceed with the review.This is perhaps THE closest anime to hentai you can ever find (well, lets just say it is at least on par...to the well know fan service friendly Ikkitousen series). The ecchiness of Kanokon is beyond imagination! Though the rating states ""Mild Nudity"", I think it is more appropriate for it to say ""Heavy Nudity"" (especially after watching episode 7).Story:For a 12 episode long anime, the story is bit on the slow side at the beginning. Though I understand that some episodes were needed for character development.  It is nice on one hand that the producer managed to wrap things up with various couples in the show, but there were still mysteries left unresolved. The most notable one is the mystery behind the young girl with the teddy bear. Perhaps they will cover that in the manga (if it’s not already been covered), or perhaps there’ll be a 2nd season for Kanokon, we’ll wait and see.Artwork:The artwork was a bit weird for me at first (mainly the eyes and the cheeks…they look really “cartoon-ish”), but after getting used to it, the animation quality is actually quite nice.Others:Nothing particular to comment on regarding the sound (though the opening is quite good for the show). Characters are all very lively (though not always in a believable way).Overall:Overall, the anime is very very enjoyable if you are planning on watching ecchi anime to begin with. But for those who are in fact intending to watch hentai, then you might be disappointed (well perhaps you can try the DVD specials, those are known for intense fan service).Lastly, I would like to praise the director for doing a job well done.

Kanokon manages to be one of the most perverted and in many ways disturbing things I have ever watched.  It’s fortunate that it was short, because I doubt that I could have finished it had it been any longer.Kanokon basically doesn’t have a story.  A weak an uninteresting boy starts his year at a new high school where he is inexplicably besieged by hot girls.  Standard echii anime fare here.  The problem is nothing interesting ever happens.  Kouta tries to avoid the affections of...all the girls throwing themselves at him and the girls just keep trying, getting more and more outrageous as the series unfolds.  There is some comedy to be found though.  Kanokon does have its moments, if you can suspend your disbelief over Kouta and his lack of manliness.  The interactions between Chizuru and all her rivals for his affections are pretty funny.  Though after a while even this becomes less funny after you see the same joke for the tenth time.The thing that bothered me the most however was the characters.  Well one in particular.. Kouta.  Why are all these girls throwing themselves at a weak, boring, underdeveloped boy who looks like he should be entering the 3rd grade instead of being in High School.  High School? Really?  Seeing this boy get molested episode after episode made me want to call the police more than it made me laugh.  Chizuru and Nozomu are really the only highlights of the show from a character aspect.  They are the only ones who are genuinely funny or even slightly interesting.  However the fox/wolf spirit aspect of the pair are never properly developed and seem to have been added solely to bridge the time in between Kouta's next molestation.Visually Kanokon looks great.  Despite Chizuru's gravity defying measurements she is still pretty adorable as are the other girls.  Again Kouta takes points away because of the way he looks.  The voice acting is really good and it does save the series in some respects.  Though not even one of my favorites Mamiko Noto could make me like Kouta.  The music is also very strong.If you are a diehard harem fan and love fan service, loli's, fox-spirits, hentai, and huge breasts smothering small children this is your show!

The music is also very strong.If you are a diehard harem fan and love fan service, loli's, fox-spirits, hentai, and huge breasts smothering small children this is your show!  Anyone else should preserve the IQ points you will lose watching it."", ""Holy crap, it's finally over! The anime of my dreadful loathing! This anime was just so bad, I HAD to write a review on it.Kanokon was obviously made with horny sex craving  boys as its audience. You want fanservice? It has fanservice. You want naked chicks? This anime has it. In fact, this anime goes over-the-top borderline with its sexual innuendos, activities and visual eye candy. The main character, Kouta, is stalked by two girls, both being what men usually crave. The ready-and-willing big-breasted pretty girl, and the ready-and-willing breast-less loli character. Both want sex from him, and will do anything to do...it. To sum it up, this anime is probably the closest you'll get to a hentai without it actually being a hentai.StoryThe story was mediocre, at best. I loved the whole 'demons and spirits mingle with the humans', thing, but that's about where it ended. The arc with the little loli-girl and her Nue partner was the closest this series got to an actual plot, and was probably the  only part of the series I really enjoyed, since it mildly turned away from the ecchi to focus on action and combat. The fact that two girls follow and want to bed one boy who looks like he should be in grade-school was enough to turn me off. I'm a girl, and I love my shota, but this is just unbelievably unrealistic to a very fine degree.ArtThis is where the anime really shines. The art is undeniably some of the best in the anime released this spring, and I probably won't forget the beauty of Kanokon's style anytime soon. To be honest, it was probably the art that made me stick with and endure the show to the last episode. Even I have to admit that the animation remained smooth throughout the entire series. Maybe when animating the males it fell slightly, but when doesn't that happen when you're watching an ecchi or harem anime? The Art would have gotten a perfect 10 if it wasn't for my lingering thoughts that the animation was made like this solely to tune up the ecchi.SoundNot really much to say here. The only really great point of the sound is the voice-acting. Of course, to most that's the whole deal right? I don't really remember the music that much, so that goes to show that it wasn't all too good in my opinion. Yeah.... this is all I can really say about the sound.CharacterThe characters were decent enough. I didn't really like the fact that poor little Kouta's called 'the ero-king' by all the girls and is put down by that, even though it wasn't his fault. Of course, that seems to be the fate of all boys in harem and ecchi animes. Even if a face-plant into the nearest rack was an accident, it's ALWAYS the boy's fault. Poor, poor boys. There were only three characters that succeeded in putting a smile on my face whenever they were onscreen. And that's Tayura, and the twins Ai and Ren.EnjoymentIs it over yeeeet?This anime had me checking my player's episode length to see how much longer I had to suffer through another episode of boobs, sex and girls that want sex. I was so bored through most of the episodes I would pause about every eight minutes to go see what was happening elsewhere on the net. Yes. It was THAT good.OverallOverall? Don't watch it unless you're a boy that gets off on this kind of stuff. Or a  girl that can tolerate this anime that greatly degrades women. it.

Unless they like hentai too.Yes indeed, this is THE closest thing to hentai you will probably ever see in an anime. It's nuts. But what's underneath all the fanservice, you ask? Well, a mediocre storyline, I'm sorry to say. This anime focuses all it's energy on the fanserivce (like the manga does, so no surprise there). Let's jump right in.STORY: 6/10It's really not that inventive; the whole story feels like a setup so that Kouta can get into ecchi situations. Two spirit girls start liking him, a bunch of random crap happens. No real...movement of the story, but what can you expect...ART: 6/10The whole anime I was extremely annoyed at how young Kouta looks. That's like 10 years old, man! OH well... besides that, the eye styles for the anime were new and kinda cool for a change. The rest was just mediocreCHARACTER: 7/10Nothing special, nothing at all in fact. You never really see what Kouta thinks about anything else, same goes for the other characters. I would've liked to see more of the principal, that guy cracked me up. Besides that, everyones mind is filled with 75% fanserice...ENJOYMENT: ~8/10This one really depends on who watches it. If you enjoy fanservice, then 10/10. If you hate it, then realize this anime is fanserice, and walk away now. that would give this a 3/10. This combined with some actually genuinely funny moments are what make up Kanokon. I actually laughed out loud at some parts, but if you're only looking for comedy, you'll have to brave the storm of fanservice or walk away. I would suggest the latter. For me, however, this was an enjoyable series.OVERALL: 8/10I almost always take enjoyment to be the main influence of my overall, because it should be. This anime is not about a good story, or well developed characters. It's essentially about fanservice, and although that was enjoyable at the time, it really wears off, to be honest. I walked away from Kenshin thinking &quot;YES, now THAT was a true anime!&quot; I walked away from Kanokon tihnking &quot;why didnt I spend this time to rewatch the first 12 episodes of Kenshin?&quot; At the time it was enjoyable, though, so give it a try if you like fanservice. movement of the story, but what can you expect...ART: 6/10The whole anime I was extremely annoyed at how young Kouta looks.

Also I'm tired today, so please bear with me guys ;3StoryStory? HAH. There pretty much is no story. Kanokon's story is none existant. It's just about how the overly-horny-for-a-little-shouta-boy Chizuru trys to get Kouta, the boy, to have sex with her.Right at the beginning there was certain potential involving the fight scenes and the concept of Chizuru being a fox deity, but nothing was...ever played out into anything deeper than &quot;oh look, she has a tail every now and then.&quot; Seriously, the writers seemed to completely forget about the supposed main story line and just had fun writing this almost-hentai script. This series is as close to hentai as you'll ever get without watching hentai itself.It's aimed for guys who get off on seeing chunky chicks like Chizuru take all her clothes off at any given oppotunity.AnimationNothing special here. The very few fight scenes that were shown were fairly average, Chizuru looked like she was covered in oil all the time because she was so damn shiny, and the characters' eyes were drawn funny. Not to my taste really, but then again it wasn't dreadful.SoundThe only reason why I gave the series a 2 rather than a 1 overall was because of the music. It was absolutely beautiful, totally what I enjoy and it fitted rather well with the series as both songs were about love and physically wanting someone. Especially the ending song, sung by Sakakibara Yui. It was so upbeat in the chorus and really made me want to dance XD;CharacterWhat can I say about them that's positive? Nothing. They were boring, standard, flat, 2D, recycled and had no depth. They were there to show panties and get naked and nothing more. Boring as hell.Nozomu made me laugh at the beginning, but then she got boring. She was only there to make Chizuru want to cling onto Kouta even more. And Kouta himself, he was such a drippy little thing. Even though he obviously didn't want to do those kinds of things with Chizuru he never actually tried to stop her because he was too much of a weakling. Seriously, he really pissed me off.The only highlight was the twins, but they were barely shown. If they had been in it more, then my rating would have gone up to around a 4.EnjoymentI did not enjoy this series one bit. I only watched it right the way through to the end because I really wanted to say &quot;hey look, I put up with it&quot; and also because I hate dropping series. And I guess I'm stubborn too ^^; never again will I watch a series as dreadful and brainlessly ecchi as this.OverallOnly watch it if you want some hardcore ecchi that is on the brink of hentai.

Then, I saw advertisments for the anime in magazines, and damn, it caught my eye. So when the subs came out, I downloaded them every week, watched them, and this is what I thought about it.Story: There wasn't really much of a story, as this anime was quite the slice-of-life anime. Every episode was basically Chizuru and Nozomu trying to seduce and get into the pants of the main character, Kouta. There was a fair bit of comedy, but not gut-bustingly funny. Drama around the last few episodes were very meh, it...didn't really have much effect. Every episode, I'll admit, was repetitive, but the action definitely made up for it, as I will explain below.Art: Oh damn, out of all the ecchi animes I've watch, this one has the best art, especially the characters. Tons and tons of bare skin, to the point where people blogging the show asked if this was a soft-core hentai. The bodies, especially Chizuru, were drawn oh-so-well, really showing her figure well. The other characters were also drawn well, the animation was solid, and it made use of lots of different colours and settings effectively.Sound: Voice acting was good, but I hated Kouta's voice. This boy must have no balls, because he has the highest pitched voice in the anime, and it got DAMN ANNOYING after a few episodes.Characters: Very cliche. Kouta is the typical useless/ball-less harem lead, and I didn't like him much, due to him always trying and avoid Chizuru's advances. Chizuru was the big breasted, main character loving female character, always trying to seduce him, but I never got the impression that she was slutty much. Maybe determined is a good word.  Nozomu is the silent loli also wanting to get into Kouta's pants, and she was boring to watch. I thought that the side characters were more interesting than the main characters to watch, especially Tayura and Asahina.Enjoyment: This is where the anime shines. Hordes and hordes of wonderful, life giving, bloodloss-inducing, bouncy ecchiness. I loved it, this show was intended to be eye candy, and it performed very well. Hell, the ecchiness alone is enough to warrant rewatching the series, and I do plan to do that sometime.Overall: It was a very fun ride watching Kanokon every week, it was interesting enough to keep you watching it, it had more than enough action to get your blood rushing, and it was generally enjoyable to watch. Definitely one of the better ecchi/harem animes out there, and if you aren't the type to analyse every bit of the plot, characters and logic of animes, you will like this. didn't really have much effect.

Then after about episode 2 i thought to myself ""why am i watching this instead of porn?""I found it incredibly difficult to swallow this anime mainly because i hated the main character, Kouta.  Kouta is the definition of pussy.  Hes some 10 year old super small, shy, gay, pussy assed little kid.  That\'s all i can say.  I really think that they could have made this show hilarious if they had replaced the main lead...with a more masculine douche bad type of guy.  It may sound bad, but i could see this anime being beyond hilarious if that happened.Enjoyment:  I just couldn\'t really enjoy this, because im just not into a little 10 year old being raped by a foxy babe. That\'s dumb. I mean some of the situations are funny, but the wolf is a bitch too.  The only person that i liked was Chizuru, maybe it was the boobs talking but she was the only fairly likable character.The sound was ok, but if you really want to enjoy this a fraction of a bit more you would need to watch the Japanese version.  The dub was just bad.  You could tell that the people were reading that shit off a piece of paper and theyre reactions sucked.Even though this anime may have its faults (A lot of them) I felt that this anime could have been so much more, WHY?  Its because Kouta the little pussy just ruins it for me.  I have never seen such a little pussy in my life.  It makes me feel like beating him up and banging Chizuru myself and then replacing him with a more masculine guy to at least make the anime 500 times funnier. with a more masculine douche bad type of guy.

Well it is ecchi, but its not as ecchi as some shows like Girls Bravo and so. "", 'Hello boys and girls,I\'ve looked through several ""so-so"" and ""outright trash"" kind of reviews and I feel it\'s necessary to say a word in defense of Kanokon.Because I think that it\'s a masterpiece in it\'s niche.Ok, everybody open your eyes now.It\'s E C C H I (full stop).The essense of it. And all the rest just doesn\'t matter.No main male character - don\'t care (actually he is, but Kouta is as good as no main character).No plot - it\'s irrelevant.If you complain that Kanokon is missing some (or all) of those element - you are right. But don\'t forget that ecchi (as any other genre)...rarely walks alone. You might have grown used to ecchi + romance or something else.And Kanokon is just ecchi that conquers all.Kanokon is walking on the very thin ledge: between ecchi and hentai (yep, 18+ strict!). And I found Kanokon to be even better than hentai (just like striptease is better than just boringly naked woman).12 episodes are just fine - it stops even before it could get boring.Concerning perversions (and necessity to be a pervert to watch this anime): my dear folks, you\'d better watch Disney ;)Finally, love it or just turn it off (as with any other anime)  ^ _ ^ rarely walks alone.

Bothered yet? Boobies, melons, bosoms, fun-bags, playthings, tits, breasts. Still not bothered? Well, you have passed the ""Kanokon"" test, my friend. Welcome to a magical anime, filled with boobs, boobs, and, yet, more boobs.The way the story begins sets the tone for the rest of the story. Not in the way that they continue to develop it, more like they let you know that it\'s there, basically causing all the drama in the series, but let ""mini-arcs"", spanning an episode or two, act as the story for...the show.As you could imagine - it\'s predictable. And, oddly enough, it was a nice predictable. I was never, EVER, bored watching ""Kanokon"" and I don\'t think you should be either. Unless you didn\'t pass my Kanokon test.To me, it\'s not really a harem as much as it is a borderline hentai/rom/com. There\'s one other girl, but she seems like a third-wheel. You know from the get-go that she won\'t win our hero\'s heart and the other, more ""main"" heroine will likely come out on top. However, each mini-arc is enough to keep me entertained, and the base arc of her being a fox deity keeps up the quickfire pace (as it should be) of this 12-episode-long anime. 7/10.The art, well... it acted like a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you have fabulously drawn characters and their movements are captured flawlessly. On the other hand, you have a hero who acts and looks like he could be a 10-year-old girl. I don\'t want my hero who\'s involved in a HAREM to be a 10-year-old girl. Coy and shy is okay to an extent, but when you put his animated character and personality together you really get an immature hero that\'s hard to root for, hard to identify with, and too childish. 6/10.Sound is sound. I found this anime\'s sound to be a nice, refreshing change of pace from the constant yelling in ""Seto no Hayame"". The voice actors are good; that ten-year-old girl lookalike hero just bugged the hell out of me and his voice definitely matched his small presence and stature. 7/10.Like I\'ve stated above, I had a big problem with our hero being the hero. That said, the rest of the cast was good and solid. I wished that I would\'ve seen a little more of the wolf deity woman (the name slips my mind at the moment) and that her involvement with the main character was more substantial. The supporting cast is variously funny and witty dialog is interjected here-and-there by the likes; a solid batch of characters.You know, I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I thought I would. Coming into this I knew I was going to be bombarded with hentai-esque images and ecchi moments everywhere, but that really gave the show its own, specific, identity. ""I am \'basically a soft-core porn show and so what?\'""If the anime that I watch has comes to terms with what it IS, instead of catering to something that it is NOT, I will enjoy it much more thoroughly than an anime that seems to be ""faking"".

Just some good ol\' ecchi/harem/rom/com fun that\'s a fun time to watch and let your mind drift elsewhere - probably under the chair. 7/10. the show.As you could imagine - it\'s predictable. And, oddly enough, it was a nice predictable. I was never, EVER, bored watching ""Kanokon"" and I don\'t think you should be either. Unless you didn\'t pass my Kanokon test.To me, it\'s not really a harem as much as it is a borderline hentai/rom/com. There\'s one other girl, but she seems like a third-wheel. You know from the get-go that she won\'t win our hero\'s heart and the other, more ""main"" heroine will likely come out on top. However, each mini-arc is enough to keep me entertained, and the base arc of her being a fox deity keeps up the quickfire pace (as it should be) of this 12-episode-long anime. 7/10.The art, well... it acted like a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you have fabulously drawn characters and their movements are captured flawlessly. On the other hand, you have a hero who acts and looks like he could be a 10-year-old girl. I don\'t want my hero who\'s involved in a HAREM to be a 10-year-old girl. Coy and shy is okay to an extent, but when you put his animated character and personality together you really get an immature hero that\'s hard to root for, hard to identify with, and too childish. 6/10.Sound is sound. I found this anime\'s sound to be a nice, refreshing change of pace from the constant yelling in ""Seto no Hayame"".

Meek little men that look like they\'d lose in an armwrestle with a hamster would be getting all the attention from strong overconfident women. I shit you not, the ""male lead"" here squeals like a weasel and apologises to his deceased grandfather every time girls try to initiate sexual contact with him. I\'ve never been so fucking rustled in my entire life.The plot... there isn\'t any. Just one weak boy that was probably manufactured with a flaccid dick and a horde of one dimensional nymphos. They force themselves on him,...he starts looking like a rotten tomato and runs away screaming some shit about his grandfather and how immoral sexual activities are. Rinse and repeat - whole 12 episodes. I had to light up a joint and pretend he\'s just playing hard to get to avoid slamming my monitor against the wall every time he went full retard.The art was decent however and I imagine this would be the only reason why anyone in their right mind would ever want to watch this perversion of natural selection - ecchi fanservice. There are nicely animated tits and asses in every episode for your viewing pleasure but if that\'s all you\'re looking for... just look up hentai. Saves you the headache of wading through this apocalyptic disaster of a ""plot"".The sound & OST were horrid at best. The male lead sounds like a castrated chipmunk with guilt issues and the females squirt over his skinny pale ass like he\'s mandingo. The music will make your ears bleed and the OP & ED themes like the ones here have been confirmed to be the cause of erectile dysfunction in young men across the world.Enjoyment - there is none. This shit will infuriate any man or woman. It doesn\'t matter what you believe or where you hail from - this anime is a rape of the natural balance of nature we observe everyday.Wasted best bud to try to get through this.

Why did I even think it was going to be different? The characters are perverted, and act strangely odd.The story goes way to fast, bringing up more questions then answers. All the story is becomes a love triangle with a short little kid in the middle of it. This is pretty much Hentai without the sex. It’s messed up and would be much better if they just used the sex in order to have a more interesting story line. AND THERE IS NO ENDING! It gives us a ‘read...the manga’ ending that always pisses me off. If I wanted to read the manga, I would of done so already or read it instead of watching the anime.Chizuru is a really interesting girl who is really hangs onto Kouta all the time. She is extremely pushy and keeps wanting him to go out with her. All this teasing really pushes him from her all the time. It also seems that all the time, she ends up trying to sleep with him. When she shows that she’s a fox, he actually for some reason doesn’t care much. Then we have the problem with him falling in love with her slightly. There is also the fact that he and her end up becoming one whenever they kiss and she wants to be with him. Nozomu doesn’t seem to have much personality in the beginning but and always seems to act like a love rival.Characters rarely have any personality out of just a standard archy types with not much of a story behind how they act. The characters are all 2 Dimensional.Now, the show actually got better as it went on, and around the 4th episode, it actually got a lot better artwork and the voices weren’t as stale. It feels like they got into the show more. Not only that but I believe it was the 5th episode where my favorite character was introduced. To bad he only stayed for one episode though. I really liked Saku Ezomori.The music in the beginning is pretty standard as well as the animation. It pretty much has a loneliness walking style to it and showing the characters. And then somehow, the main character turning into a ‘fox boy’ for some strange reason. The animation is really butt ugly in many aspects for the background characters, making them lose much detail. The main characters may be detailed in a sense but the personality is really bland.The voices… dear god the voices… They messed them all up. Chizuru is really high voiced and can probably hurt my ears. Kouta sounds like a little child, not like he would be in the same grade as all the other characters. The script is a bit choppy and again really doesn’t explain much. Sometimes the script is delivered without much feeling. Also some of the lip sinks are bad, they don’t work right. the manga’ ending that always pisses me off.

"", 'Between the 10 Freeway, Downtown Los Angeles traffic, and missing the first hour of a cyber security conference, what did I dislike the most of those eventful two days? That would be the anime show I was watching as I sat in the car. It took us roughly two hours to travel between Destination A and Destination B, both ways as the traffic wouldn\'t let up. Kanokon was the show that I was happening to watch; oddly enough, I was looking for an ecchi show as I waited. Its 12-episode length allowed me to finish the entire show within the span of the trips since...it was a two-day conference, and it wasn\'t gridlock or 90-degree heat that made this show a horrible watch. I have determined that the show itself is the reason why this show is not a good show.Kanokon is your typical ecchi, your typical fantasy show, your typical harem-style show, with one minor detail: it\'s all completely pointless. How pointless? It\'s a knife that doesn\'t cut, nor is it meant to spread butter, nor is it heavy enough to act as a paperweight. It\'s a pencil that doesn\'t write and the eraser is as rock-solid as a brick. It\'s a love story that\'s actually worse than Twilight, as the notorious Internet meme goes. Don\'t get me wrong. I am attempting to avoid misleading you into thinking that I hate this show out of pure spite, which is why I will try to write what I saw in this show without giving it a personal bias.Well, I did say that I would try.Story: What if you were stuck in a world of spirits and ""yokai"" and demons and devils, and there were a couple of things that you\'ve been made aware of? Spirits cannot harm humans and a kiss can transfer powers between two individuals, and a whole mess of demons do not approve of your questionable love affair? I think I described the world of Kanokon in a nutshell, but for those who want to ask ""why does this happen"", or ""what background does it have behind it"" or ""is there anything else?"" Unfortunately, that\'s all I picked up. There\'s no history behind the spirits aside from the given that they co-exist with humans and the storyline has no other motive behind it other than allowing fan service to exist. How can I rephrase that? ""It\'s the plot that works for plot.""Well, look at that. A cheesy line to describe a cheesy storyline.Art: Fan service comes in droves; there\'s no end to it. The funny thing about it is the way they try to make it look important to the storyline, but when you come right down to it, take out the fan service and it has absolutely nothing to do with the way the story progresses. All they did showcase was  a timid prepubescent boy and a girl with an insatiable sex drive using any excuse they could to take a stab at attempted intercourse.It\'s such a shame as well. To make up for everything else that this show lacks in, fan service HAS to present itself. I\'m sure for those who prefer fan service in their shows, Kanokon will be an easy show for them to get along with, but for those who enjoy it in moderation, Kanokon is definitely a show to avoid like the ex-girlfriend that is desperately trying to contact you at 12:00 midnight.Character: If the characters rolled out of a factory, which I\'m sure was really the case, each one of them has exemplified everything that was wrong with Chevy in the 1980\'s. There\'s nothing special about them and most of them seem like they have a screw loose. The protagonist, for example, Minamoto Chizuru, has no reason to love Kouta, the male lead. We\'re never given a proper reason, yet she does (and it may be safe to say that dropping her on her head was a normal childhood occurrence). It doesn\'t stop at a simple interest, which is acceptable in this situation; it is a wild addiction that turns her into a first-class whore every time she is in contact with Kouta. Speaking of Kouta, I have never seen a more useless male lead, one that is easily molded by anything that flies in his direction, like grains of sand or the common housefly. He also objects to Chizuru\'s physical affection, but why is it that at the end of the series, he can finally muster up the courage to say he loves her? I\'m pretty sure down the line, he gave up and allowed Chizuru to have her way with him, however the hell that\'s about to happen.The support cast are somehow the most appealing characters in this entire show, with the exception of the antagonists. The antagonists make just as much sense as the main cast, who will set the stage for a fight for a few reasons: to declare love for no good reason, to test someone for no good reason, or to pick a fight for no good reason. One of the antagonists that picks a fight tries to take Chizuru from Kouta, and after he is hit with one energy beam, he packs up and leaves as if nothing happened because he is a cowardly pretty boy who was more worried about the smudge on his leather coat than losing the girl he ""likes"" to a 6th grade kid. Another spirit comes along, begins attacking Chizuru, and after trading one or two blows, she leaves and says, ""oh, I was just testing you."" What\'s the point of that? If I wanted to test something, I\'d just become a teacher and hand out tests to everyone that walks into the classroom. The last couple just attacks them. Why? Why would you want to attack someone without any reason? ""Oh yes, it would be fun, wouldn\'t it-"" come off it already. Now you\'re just confirming your stupidity.Enjoyment: I mentioned above that this is a fantasy show. Fantasy shows generally come with action. Kanokon, unfortunately, has fighting sequences. Why is it unfortunate? Because fight sequences stop themselves halfway before finishing. Each of the antagonists flee halfway through the battle, and this paves the stage for multiple anti-climactic sequences, which become quite tedious to watch. Maybe I\'m expecting too much from an ecchi show, but what if I compared it to a show like Omamori Himari? That\'s a harem with ecchi scenes AND action, and they pulled it off correctly. Why couldn\'t Kanokon do it? Or rather, what blender did you use to screw up this show so badly, and what setting was it on?As always, I\'m only a fan of ecchi in moderation. Since I\'m not the type of guy to enjoy shows filled to the brim with fan service, I\'ll have to let you decide that for yourself; do you watch for the plot or do you watch for the plot?Overall: Believe it or not, I have a least favorite anime that\'s not called Kanokon. Despite all that I can say about this show, I would still watch it in front of Air Gear, which would be as rock bottom as rock bottom gets for me, unless another show wants to take its place. Sure, it avoided being one of my most disliked shows, but it\'s still much closer to the bottom of my list than it is to the top. I do know that shows have potential to reach greater heights if they would just throw out a good number of useless elements, but Kanokon lacks any of that potential. There\'s no story, the characters are flimsy pushovers, and fan service has always been a useless addition to any show. I know a good number of people out there enjoyed it much more than I did, but Kanokon isn\'t just a bad show. It\'s a bad show with a fanbase.I don\'t mind if you took my words and said, ""oh, I\'m watching this show anyways."" In fact, I couldn\'t care less what you did with your time just as long as it doesn\'t cut into mine. But there are only two paths you can take with this show: love it and dismiss every word of offense towards this show or hate it and end up realizing that you wasted a good chunk of your time watching bad characters look like they\'re about to do something.And a note to the writers: next time you want to blend something, I recommend that you use my personal choice, the Vita-Mix 5000.

However, I\'m rating Kanokon first, so I hope my review doesn\'t sound too cynical. Here goes.There\'s really -no- story to this anime. The only thing I managed to get out of it was a bit of arousal. But I suppose that\'s why they call it ecchi. It\'s borderline hentai, in my opinion. I think I saw up Chizuru\'s skirt over one hundred times. But seriously. It was really pushed to the limit to the point where it wasn\'t even entertaining when it...happened. The flashing was just too common. Fanservice is nice, but there\'s a point where enough is enough. This is definitely NOT a family anime. Hide this. Far away. Out of sight.The main character, Kouta, looks like he\'s in preschool. Yeah. I said preschool. And his eyes are ridiculously... large... and... and well. Yeah. It\'s bothersome. He would have looked better with a bag on his head. And then you have Chizuru who, surprise surprise, falls in love with Kouta. But what would any anime be without the rival? As a result, you then have Nozomu, clinging to Kouta nearly just as much as Chizuru. Throughout this whole anime, you\'re probably asking yourself why you\'re watching this. I\'m surprised I didn\'t just toss this halfway through. Maybe it\'s because I\'m perverted. Yeah, actually, that\'s probably it. Oh, did I mention, Chizuru and Nozomu are spirits? Yep. A fox and wolf spirit to be exact. Sounds cool, but it really doesn\'t affect the anime too much. My favorite character ended up being Tayura, probably because he was one of the more normal characters. But that\'s enough of that. The characters were mediocre at best, and whenever I watched Nozomu, I swear she reminded me of Yuki Nagato from The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya. XP Probably because she was the silent type. OH WELL.This anime is one of those things that you\'ll end up liking, or end up hating. I\'ll give it an award for maintaining an ""ecchi"" label, even though most of the show, you\'re listening to perverted comments, and watching Chizuru push Kouta into her breasts so she can, lol, ""spoil him.""Overall, if you\'re looking for fanservice, this is it.

Just don\'t expect too much out of this one.', 'My first review heads up.Story: 3While lacking any real meta story (other than maybe the last two episodes), the story of each episode is what\'s important. However no real character development happen during these episodes and nothing really affects the overall series. If you like a series with story Kanokon is not for you.Art:6There isn\'t much to say about the art. The character designs are pretty generic, even the ""spirit form"" of the main character. However it is fairly fluid and there aren\'t any major animation kerfuffles.Sound: 5Again not really a lot to say. The OP and ED are pretty unmemorable. I tended to skip...past them.Character: 2This is where the series really takes a nosedive. The rule of ""status quo is god"" seems to be in effect here. The events of one episode tend not to affect the characters in a later episode. With this there is little-to-no character development. The characters seem to be exactly the same, and be acting the exact same way in the first episode as the last episode. I found the supporting characters to be egregious and more than anything annoying, with one exception (the twins). The main characters themselves are extremely annoying. Kouta, the male lead, has very little personality other than the fact that he looks like an elementary student and is extremely passive to the sexual abuse he endures throughout the series. Chizuru is the aggressive and horny 400 year old fox spirit, she spends most of her time obsessing over Kouta, to the point where when she thought she couldn\'t be with him sexually she was willing to die. Nozomu is the more passive, and less sexual but still aggressive foil to Chizuru. She spends most of the series playing ""raised by wolves"" antics, interrupting Chizuru\'s ""naughty"" plans for Kouta at the worst time, and trying to match (and failing) Chizuru\'s sexual abuse of Kouta.Enjoyment: 4This is where people may differ. If you enjoy ecchi anime then there is the possibility you\'ll enjoy Kanokon. However if you\'re looking for a series with more than just fanservice then this is likely to disappoint you.Overall: 4While I didn\'t particularly enjoy this. Others may find this less than not enjoyable. I don\'t recommend this for anyone looking for a ""good"" show to watch. However if you\'re a fan of ecchi and fanservice this is just the show for you, and that\'s okay. past them.Character: 2This is where the series really takes a nosedive. The rule of ""status quo is god"" seems to be in effect here. The events of one episode tend not to affect the characters in a later episode. With this there is little-to-no character development. The characters seem to be exactly the same, and be acting the exact same way in the first episode as the last episode. I found the supporting characters to be egregious and more than anything annoying, with one exception (the twins). The main characters themselves are extremely annoying.

However if you\'re a fan of ecchi and fanservice this is just the show for you, and that\'s okay.', 'Hey all, Robert\'s Too Late Reviews are rampaging across the internet once again! Today\'s pertinent information is that I\'m discussing the dubbed version of this anime, and this includes the two episode OVAs. To get to the quick of things, this anime is just terrible. It needs to be taken out behind the barn and shot. If you could only skip one show, this one would be a very strong contender. I would burn down the RTLR wall before putting anyone from this anime on it. Let\'s begin this fox hunt.Story: 3I make no bones about enjoying the ecchi or harem genre of shows. I...watched Highschool DxD, Testament of Sister New Devil, Omamori Himari, and while I didn\'t find all them stellar, I have to say that they are all cream of the crop when compared to this series. This anime is nothing but walking plot holes, and is full of nothing but fanservice without reason. Now I said in my Testament review that the sexual parts were horribly abused, but it at least had a shred of a storyline, this show does not. We are expected to be happy as bugs in a rug with ecchi content purely for ecchi\'s sake.So if you\'re not interested in sexual innuendo sprinkled LIGHTLY with a half assed plot of the primary female being a fox girl who can sprout a tail and fox ears on command, then you\'re in the wrong neighborhood for sure. The fox girl does nothing throughout the entire series than sexually proposition the MC (who is around 15 but looks and sounds as if he\'s 12) to the point of sexual harassment, and follows up most of the time by shoving the MC\'s face in between her tits, whether he wants it or not. That\'s pretty much how the entire thing goes, her demanding sex from the guy, him turning her down, then her groping or performing indecent acts on him. Throw in a romantic rival that is basically her opposite that he has to fend off as well, and you\'ve got about all your going to get from this anime. The other girl is a wolf girl as opposed to the primary being a fox, wolf has very small breasts where fox has huge knockers, wolf is rather calm in her demeanor and fox is overly emotional, and all that usual \'competing for attention\' nonsense.Do we ever find out why the fox girl is in love with the MC? No. Do we find out why wolf girl is too? No. Do we ever learn why fox girl and her older brother live alone when her mother and sister live elsewhere? No. As an aside, fox mom hits on this 12 year old looking boy as well, to the point in the OVAs to where she LITERALLY whips out her tits and jiggles them in front of the MC. We basically don\'t get a single shred of background or world building of any kind in the entire series. It\'s all about fox girl begging for sex and MC continuously rejecting her only to have her smash her breasts in his face. Fox girl sometimes goes to great lengths to set up a situation where she can attempt to prey on the MC always to have it, much to the MC\'s relief, be ruined by wolf girl or other circumstances.An example, there is literally a scene where fox girl has her panties around her knees, and is bent over asking the MC to spank her. Fox girl has no problem at all in showing off her tits as much as possible to the guy, and sadly neither does wolf girl. The best character in the show really is a girl who is utterly outraged at the two girls\' behaviors, at least the flirting she witnesses. If she knew about the constant peer pressure to have sex, her head would explode. It\'s a bad sign when the straight laced side character is the only one that doesn\'t appear to be a sexual predator.Speaking of, if this anime was gender swapped, there would people marching with torches and pitchforks. If a teen guy continually pressured a younger girl to have sex, to the point of mounting and getting into position, sometimes while nude, we\'d all be outraged. But because it\'s a girl coming onto a guy, it seems to be played for laughs. I don\'t think its funny at all. If a guy committed sexual assault like fox girl does with her face to titties move, that would be decried as supporting \'rape culture\' and demeaning women. And that would be a fair assessment. But again, since the MC is the one not wanting sex instead of fox girl, that seems to make it all okay.It is still disturbing without the idea of a gender swap as well. If you, no matter what gender you are, do not want to have sex with a certain person, then no means no, period. Even if you\'re supposed to be a hormone crazed teen boy. Our MC doesn\'t even fit that pattern, he literally spends the series saying over and over again ""stop, we can\'t do this."" He has every right to be secure in his own body, and the right to determine what he does and who he does it with. Consent in this show does not exist. Fox girl, and to a lesser extent, wolf girl are both like Bill Cosby level sexual predators.There\'s a throwaway plot about how fox girl can kiss the MC and somehow possess him but that\'s only trotted out a few times, and basically forgotten for more sexual harassment. Now in the regular aired series we see that the older brother of fox girl has a crush on the straight lace girl, but if the OVAs are omitted, they have no development or resolution whatsoever. Not only that, in the ending episodes a mysterious girl and a silent bodyguard appear, make menacing comments about making the MC \'all hers\' and calling him \'big brother\', but the pair just vanish and never come back. No explanation, nothing at all. ""I\'ll make big brother all mine next time"" I think is the last line this mysterious younger girl says, and then is never seen or referenced again in any manner.The two OVAs bring a scant bit of story into the mix, only with more HUGE helpings of predator fanservice. We get to see fox brother ask out straight lace girl, and she agrees to go with him to see a fireworks display. He stretches like he\'s going to pull the old arm around the girl act, and she shuts that down with a look that could kill, but a little later does compliment his choice of spots for viewing the fireworks. So they get a slight resolution that they might just start dating though she is still VERY conservative in her ways.Yes, at one point the MC says he loves fox girl, but I can\'t take that without the lingering doubt that it\'s coerced out of him. He also in the late episodes mentions he kind of enjoys a face full of breasts, but he hesitates to say so, making me think that maybe he says so out of fear of what would happen if he said no. There\'s a few moments dealing with a pair of friends from the MC\'s class, but they are basically throwaway filler. So we have a show about an older girl trying to have sex with a younger guy against his will, and we\'re supposed to find that amusing. Yeah, not happening.Art: 5The show doesn\'t look too bad, we have the monster tit disorder that seems to plague all nudity in anime. If you\'re going to see nude breasts, then in most cases, her melons will be bigger than her head. Holds true here too, and that\'s yet another tired trope. The art doesn\'t look all that bad, it\'s just mediocre at best.Sound: 3The MC really does sound like he\'s 11 or 12. Sounds very young. The fox gilr and the wolf girl both have super annoying voices that are damn near intolerable. The rest of the cast is middle-of-the-road at best. The themes get the job done, but they are forgettable. Again the only bright spot is the straight lace girl, who is always snapping at everyone about their indecent behavior. She does sound genuinely annoyed.  Maybe the actress in real life was annoyed at the quality of the series itself.Character: 3We\'ve talked about the characters pretty extensively there in the story section, so we\'ll not retread that ground so much. No one seems to have any motivation for what they do. Fox girl\'s mother admits to being 400 years old and still feels that it\'s appropriate for her to expose herself to a teenage boy, and brag about how guys still want to bang her. The fox sister seems only to be there to take up space, hardly ever saying a word. Fox brother and straight lace girl are about the only ones not over the top. And let\'s not forget mystery girl and her obvious preparation to become a villain later on but disappears. Maybe someone, for reasons I cannot fathom, believed they would get a second season of this bullshit. Thank God that didn\'t happen.Enjoyment: 3Yeah, kinda obvious on this point, is it not? I\'m not being puritanical or hating on ecchi content or anything like that. It can be fun when it\'s done properly, but we don\'t have that here. We have an MC that literally tries to run away every time fox girl says \'let\'s do it!\' and I can\'t roll with that train at all.Best Girl: Bet you can guess this one already: Asahina Akane, aka straight lace girl, probably because she is the only voice of reason in the whole series, and the fact she handles herself in a mature manner.So yeah, totally a pass. The only reason I didn\'t drop it is that I\'m a completionist at heart, and a little morbid in that I wondered how they were going to up the offensive material every episode. They got it done, I gotta give them that. I tend to be positive and write good reviews, but I just couldn\'t let this one go. Not even bouncing titties every few minutes could inspire any optimism in me. If I convince one person to pass on this show, then I feel I have achieved something of value. Life is too short for crap like this, doing absolutely nothing is a better use of your time than watching this. Excuse me while I go find a stiff drink and try to forget this anime even exists. watched Highschool DxD, Testament of Sister New Devil, Omamori Himari, and while I didn\'t find all them stellar, I have to say that they are all cream of the crop when compared to this series.

Excuse me while I go find a stiff drink and try to forget this anime even exists.', 'Once, my friend came over and brought the first disc of this anime in a bag he always had with him. The cover entailed two topless women with tails sexually attacking what you could assume was the main character. The cover art was screaming ""don\'t watch me."" Regardless, I was curious, so I began watching it anyway just to see what it was about, why the cover was so risque, and to see exactly how terrible it was. This is probably the third worst anime I\'ve ever seen, the second being the Chrono Trigger OVA and the first being Mars of Destruction. Anybody who gives...this a higher score than a seven has serious mental issues. My friend gave it an eight. I\'m going to start with the most painful aspect of this trash: The storyline.Story:4I don\'t even think they were trying. They probably assumed it was enough to simply, yet forcefully, create another ""sexy"" anime, walk away, and never speak of it again.A storyline is pretty much the most important thing in an anime,  or any other form of entertainment media with special exceptions given to music and videogames. Most of this piece of crap just shows Chizuru\'s unwanted sexual advances toward Kouta.The beginning is especially horrible. Kouta\'s walking on some bridge and glances toward Chizuru. Then the theme song plays. After you watch that, Chizuru is hopelessly in love with Kouta. No explanation at all. The entire first episode is a pretty awkward introduction besides.Later, you\'re introduced to something similar to an antagonist. They exist for what, two episodes? After they get in and cause some mischief, they mysteriously leave right after Kouta rips off Rosario and Vampire.And Nozomu\'s very existence is pointless. She\'s supposed to be a rival to Chizuru, but she... well, she doesn\'t do much. Her affection towards Kouta doesn\'t really affect the plot. They could pretty much have made this entire anime without her aside from the moments introducing her and one episode later in the series having to do with a love potion.The ending isn\'t especially horrible, but it isn\'t great either.In the end, the story is just about Chiziru and some trivial problems she has in winning Kouta\'s love. That\'s about it.Art: 8Animation doesn\'t really matter to me. If it moves, I can accept it. That said, Kanokon\'s animation is pretty impressive, with lots of movement and few, if any, screw ups. Art\'s nice, too. All I could say about that.Sound: 6Nothing good, nothing bad, and I sort of slightly like the theme song. I\'ve entirely forgotten the ending theme. Gets a six.Character: 6For me, this is a pretty controversial element. While some characters are terrible, others are enigmatic and interesting. The best character by far is Tayura, who I found so enjoyable that I actually added him to my ""Favorite Characters"" list. Tayura has a slightly stronger role in the story than other support characters, which is fortunate. The other support characters are also pretty nice, even if they\'re only archtypes. As I said before, Nozomu, a rip-off of Nagato and Rei, has no real reason to be in this series. And if you watched Evangelion and hated Shinji (I believe Shinji is actually fantastic) you will hate Kouta, who whines ten times as much. Or maybe it just seems that way because his voice is so high. He isn\'t a character in truth, but a plot device. He has no redeeming qualities, which will either make you think ""Ha! if this guy can have a personal harem, then I can at least get laid!"" or ""God, even that guy can get a girlfriend and I can\'t? Why am I so hopeless?"" In other words, it will either give you confidence or depress you terribly. I am a part of the latter group who wants Kouta to get eaten by a bear. He\'s the worst character I have ever seen. Chizuru is okay, too, but she\'s also just an archtype.Enjoyment: 7How could such a terrible anime have an enjoyment level of seven? Because it is, in fact, pretty fun to watch. Only a few of the jokes are particularly funny and I\'m going to skip over the excessive fanservice entirely. However, the ways the characters react to situation after situation is undeniably enjoyable. Although the characters aren\'t good in the truest sense (except for Tayura, who always manages to be awesome in some way or other) each of them is used effectively and the entire series does have a distinctive charm. I think I would actually recommend Kanokon to somebody if I was a lesser man. The writers, admittedly, have created a pretty entertaining, if not truly funny, script.Overall: 5This isn\'t an anime you should scour the internet for. In fact, it\'d probably be better for you short term, and the anime industry long term, if you just walked away. I\'d compare this anime to drugs, I suppose, and that\'s neither a compliment nor insult, but a fact. If you watch it, you might like it, even though I\'m warning you that it really is pretty bad. If this is your thing, though, go ahead.Rezindez,The Immortal Crow this a higher score than a seven has serious mental issues. My friend gave it an eight.

Personally...I don't mind episode-by-episode Anime (if you can call this that, it's borderline) so long as it's obvious..which it is. I'm easily entertained to say the least.Art: 3I'm not particularly a fan of not matching the setting. They are High School students. Kouta and Nozomu look like they're 5. Chizuru is the one that fits the model in my opinion, problem is, it makes her appear as a total pedophile given the art style. 17 year old looking girl trying to have aggressive sexual relations with what...looks like a 5 year old child.Sound: 3Lackluster to say the least...that's about all my input on that.Character: 2HOLY CRAP...after the first episode all I wanted to do is slug the stupid out of this Kouta guy, hate him. They draw him like a 5 year old, he sounds like a 5 year old, and he seems to be absolutely terrified of anything that a kid in the 6th grade would go nuts over. He reacts to this horny big titted, good looking girl that wants every bit of him, as if she were some horrid disease. The absolute most hopeless of men would be all over that. If they at least DREW him a little bit different and gave him an older voice, I wouldn't be as upset...but would still be pissed at his total phobic aversion to the opposite sex.Chizuru is probably the only likable character given obvious reasons. Good looking, obviously looking for some, and sweet. Did I mention her assets? The only issue is, is that they portray her as a pedophile in my eyes given the fact that Kouta looks like a 5 year old. Any other guy she did this to and it would have been fine. A good example would be how Kurumu and Tsukune from R+V interacted with each other.....that's what would be acceptable.Nozomu is just as bad as Kouta in a similar but different way. She looks and sounds like a little kid as well...while she's not supposed to be. Making characters look and sound that damned young while they're supposed to be in High School is just, grossly miss-portrayed.Akane is just terribly annoying...all I want to do is tell her to piss the hell off.Enjoyment: 2This is probably the first time I've gotten angry at an Anime. The main character is an absolute panzy. I despise looking at him and hearing his voice when he's matched up with Chizuru. The ecchi can't even be funny based on the way he reacts.Overall: 3I'm not really going to repeat what was said to wrap this up. It had potential to be better with a few artwork and character adjustments, it wouldn't help by much, but it's just really, really, bad as it stands. looks like a 5 year old child.Sound: 3Lackluster to say the least...that's about all my input on that.Character: 2HOLY CRAP...after the first episode all I wanted to do is slug the stupid out of this Kouta guy, hate him. They draw him like a 5 year old, he sounds like a 5 year old, and he seems to be absolutely terrified of anything that a kid in the 6th grade would go nuts over. He reacts to this horny big titted, good looking girl that wants every bit of him, as if she were some horrid disease. The absolute most hopeless of men would be all over that. If they at least DREW him a little bit different and gave him an older voice, I wouldn't be as upset...but would still be pissed at his total phobic aversion to the opposite sex.Chizuru is probably the only likable character given obvious reasons. Good looking, obviously looking for some, and sweet. Did I mention her assets? The only issue is, is that they portray her as a pedophile in my eyes given the fact that Kouta looks like a 5 year old. Any other guy she did this to and it would have been fine. A good example would be how Kurumu and Tsukune from R+V interacted with each other.....that's what would be acceptable.Nozomu is just as bad as Kouta in a similar but different way. She looks and sounds like a little kid as well...while she's not supposed to be. Making characters look and sound that damned young while they're supposed to be in High School is just, grossly miss-portrayed.Akane is just terribly annoying...all I want to do is tell her to piss the hell off.Enjoyment: 2This is probably the first time I've gotten angry at an Anime.

I have no idea what you want from me when you ask me to rank a show's &quot;sound&quot;. If I can hear it, that's fine by me, and a show's audio would have to be truely horrid for me to say anything against it. Now, on to Kanokon.First off, the sound is utterly fantastic ; PSeriously though, apart from having a nice rhythmic title, there's little to say for this show other than the obvious. The character designs are attractive (aesthetically as well as... well, you know), and it's just as well that the...overall animation is shiny and crisp. The animators do love them some still shots, though, as the viewer takes a trip down memory lain to the sights of immobile children, forever on their way to school. And if you think the male protagonist's eyes are unsettlingly large, then join the club.Otherwise, the show is every bit as contrived as it has a rite to be... arguably more so. It's your standard &quot;fling with otherworldly beings&quot; excuse for some good oldfashioned fanservice, with some particularly stunning kiss scenes, courtesy of the aformentioned animation. The show suffers from the same affliction as all those that came before it: all the relaxed campiness is eventually bogged down by pointless drama. Not to give anything away, but there's pretty much nobody in this show who wants the two main characters to get together, or at least is willing to let them do so without a fight. I understand that true love must overcome obstacles, but this is a show about fox spirits hitting on prepubescent high schoolers; the realism ship has already sailed, you can stop swimming after it.In short, the episodes where the focus is on silly romps and startling degrees of fanservice tease (seriously, not an episode goes by where you &quot;think&quot; you saw something) are the best, because they most successfully attain a certain aspect that Kanokon is striving for. The drama bits are bearable at best (if only because they lead back around to said silly romps and fanservice) and frustrating at worst (more so than said false starts in gratuity). It's not bad by any means, but don't expect any sort of satisfying narrative out of this show (it's only 12 episodes long, for pete's sake! Minami-ke managed 13 easy, and it had less plot than a shoe). Kanokon is the chocolate Easter bunny of anime: sweet and cute on the outside but inevitably hollow (and there's more where that came from as I'm sure you already know).Also, having just read back over this, I'd like to apologize for my rampant use of parenthesis. I promise I'll work on that. overall animation is shiny and crisp.

So, did I get what I wanted?I read some people's comments and reviews about Kanokon being borderline hentai, with lots of nudity, so I was intrigued. Well... can't say I was satisfied.First, expect most of the ecchi harem stereotypes here. We have a main character who's pretty bland, and has two hot chicks throwing themselves at his feet. Does he react? No, of course not. He's constantly embarrassed by them shoving their boobs in his face. Additionally, the two chicks are yokais - one has fox powers, and the other...one has wolf powers.There are also a few side characters, but most of them were forgettable. The only side characters I liked were the redhead twins. Some of the scenes with them reminded me of classic Looney Tunes cartoons. There were also some one-time characters (mostly villains), and they were above average.The art is okay but nothing special. Same goes for the sound.So, what I wanted to see most here were ecchi scenes and nudity. Okay, to be fair, there were many ecchi scenes, boob grabbing and playing, panty shots etc. But the actual nudity was, in my opinion, scarce.Oh, and the ending was bland and anti-climactic, too.So, this anime is really nothing special. Watch it if you like ecchi, teasing, boob play, and other standard ecchi stuff. But if you're looking for a deeper story, character development and something more than just two yokai chicks obsessing over a clueless main characters, avoid Kanokon. one has wolf powers.There are also a few side characters, but most of them were forgettable.

This is the epotome of ecchiness! Maybe its not High School DxD ecchiness, but it is up there, and sometimes wonder why in the heck there isn\'t a h-scene I mean they\'ve gotten pretty close to it multiple time (I\'m only speaking about the anime of course, not including the manga just...incase someone says ""but there is sort of one""). Anyways going back let me get this review started!Story: 7The story of a young country boy named Kouta who attends a city high school for the first time, who ends up meeting a lovely, curvacious girl named Chizuru. Of course she has a secret and shares to Kouta instantaniously. She is no other than a Yellow, White tail Yokai Fox, who just happens to be over 400 years old but only looks like a 16 year old girl of course. However the story basically goes of as a somewhat forbidden-fruitful love that begins unrequited and blossoms to both party feeling mutual, of course cause love between a Human and a Yokai its deemed unworthy and an abomination in the Yokai world, groups of yokai try to test their fate, and see if their love is truly a pure and blissful love.. As they fight side by side together or in this case inside of each other, they prove countless times that their love is strong and can overcome any obstacle! Pretty cliché if you ask me.. Why not call it Romeo & Juliet with monsters and no suicide.Art: 6Art style wasn\'t really eye catching, it could\'ve been better but then again being a product from xebec you expect no less, it\'s still watchable and for it to be released in 2008 of course the animation well be a different taste compared to the anime of today of course, so in this case its falls to the fact that improvement in animation throughout the years makes this into something not really appealing, but if you watched it when it first released 6 years then, then the art would\'ve been refreshing, however compare to other anime release that same year by other companies, that ended up looking better you might not feel the same way in this one. So in the end it just falls under preference.Sound: 4Ok this category is going to be attacked a bit, but then again maybe I got to take under consiteration that I watched this on English dubbed and not in Japanese. So I\'m going to let that slide out of unfairness, however the sound affects will not be given that sort of treatment. Honestly it felt like the recording was made on a motorola razor from 2005, it sounded so bland, and cheezy, even in the fights where you espected to be epic it just lets you down, and the background music (ost) didn\'t really match up right nor fits this anime.. The opening and ending is another preference, it can be considered catchy then again to some it may not, but how this anime is the opening was nicely upbeat and in touch to how the series goes so it was a good choice of theme, however the ending was a bit unmatched, especially the musician rapid singing towards the end.Character: 8The characters were well rounded, enjoyable they each had those little nicks and crooks that made it entertaining to watch, and seeing the difference between Kouta and Chizuru was refreshing. Of course Kouta still falls under that accidental pervet who gets flusttered easily harem type king, so he is no exception, but the difference is he isn\'t totally useless. One thing is being there to being the keystone of another person power, and another is that the other person and you have to merge together to unleash true power, while its still perform as a kiss most male characters sit on the sideline and watch on, but in this case not Kouta he\'s on the front line and that was takes him apart from the typical harem king. As for Chizuru her character is the same as most in-loved female character who have an obsession to their love interest and does whatever to please him (where in the hell are these girls in real life???). All jokes aside the characters are lovable besides Asahina she\'s a prude!!(fyi that\'s just my opinion haha).Enjoyement: 6It gave me an awkward.... Whoa there buddy lets not, well it made me red, with embarrassement with such bold acts so it was a bit awkward only cause I kept forgetting Kouta was alot older than I thought. But yes seriously this was enjoyable because of the humor, why isn\'t it a 10 then? Cause the action scenes kind of killed it and the obvious scenes of course even though there weren\'t many but like I said it has your typical anime moments this anime is no exception.. However Nozomu killed me with the ""hey look its cake"" ah Nozomu even though you\'re a dandere girl, you really were hilarious in the moments you were focused on.Overall: 6All you ecchi, monster girl lover if you haven\'t watched this or planning on to, and you\'re only interested in the ""plot"" then by all mean go right ahead and watch it. For those who are into soft touched humor will a little of the perversion then give it a go, and for those into forbidden love that is tested and then conquered the once again give it a go.. If you\'re not into any of these things I mentioned then understand that your enjoyement of this anime will differ greatly and will probably cause you to hate yourself.. Not really but you won\'t find it that enjoyable but before knocking it down give it the 3 episode go if after 3 episode you don\'t see yourself watching it till the end then drop it, like I said overall this anime is rated average so don\'t expect to much out of it, beside petty enjoyement.*Readers note1.My experience of this does not reflect the rating so for me this was a bit boring and slow but for the review sake I but my personal opinion aside.2. Fanservice is not and I repeat is not only when boobs and h-scene are showned that is a miscompception.. Fanservice is when the author of the series, or the producer of the anime incorporates the fan\'s opinion into the show.. Do not confuse ecchiness with fanservice as they are 2 different things, sometimes it can be mixed when fans demand more ecchiness in the anime/manga and the producer takes that into account.

Turns out this season's came from the fanservice field.Well hey it's fun watching the moral crusaders among us wiggle uncomfortably, while we f*p and laugh to the fanservice.

I was first exposed to this style of anime right after I graduated high school with Love Hina. I\'ll admit, a little guiltily I might add, that I found it rather fun and entertaining. However it started to wear out rather fast and it didn\'t take long before I was avoiding anything remotely similar. Don\'t get me wrong, there isn\'t anything necessarily wrong with wanting to watch perverted harem anime... it\'s just not for me.And in comes Kanokon. I thought, "" Hey, it\'s been a few years, let\'s give it another try and...see what happens"". Oh boy.The plot revolves around Kouta Oyamada, a new first-year high school student not quite used to the \'big city\'. He quickly meets Chizuru, a second-year student who falls in love at first sight with Kouta on the first day of school. And here is the kicker... she is a fox spirit. In fact there are a lot of spirits masquerading as humans and for some unknown reason going to high school. Go figure. Chizuru is what any protagonists love interest should be in a harem ecchi anime; that is a big-chested horny no personality woman who is older than the main, but only just barely so. There are other people as well, including a horny wolf spirit and a slew of easily forgettable characters whom you will have no real connection with... unless you believe your animal spirit is in heat. Seek immediate medical attention if that is the case.There wasn\'t even time to prepare for this disaster as it jumps right in without even really trying to setup any kind of back story. Now I can adapt to different styles of storytelling just fine without pause but it just left me feeling like they just wanted to get to the TnA as soon as possible. It\'s the bread and butter of shows like this and I can understand that the segment of anime viewers they are shooting for want that, but wow is it just blatant. And the main character looks like a child, which in itself is disturbing.The quality of the animation was average, which isn\'t saying much. It doesn\'t pop out at you, and tends to use the same cliché faces and actions. Nothing really surprising as again the demographic this is keyed for isn\'t necessarily as concerned about the quality as the quantity, *cough*ofbreasts*cough*.I know this is a rather negative review for a score of 5; that it should have probably been a lower score. I Can\'t fault anyone on thinking that. However once everything is put together, in concert with one another, it\'s more than the sum of its parts. Not much more. Let\'s not get carried away now.

But here I go...What can I say about this anime: It truly is the borderline between Echi and Hentai...  No seriously, among all Eechi shows, this would be rated the most eechiest show I have ever seen.  So if you are the first time to watch Echi shows, better not watch this one first...About the story: Mythically... yet horrifically funny.  Imagine Naruto 9 tail fox in sexy jutsu...  That's where you get the female character.  But this is just sexy all the way.  The thing I'm...not particularly like is the transformation.  It is not Sailor moon-ish, but it is rather like wierd...However, you gotta love the characters: It is like a preschoolers about to have sex with a high school student...  Even if that preschooler is actually a HIGH SCHOOL student!!!  That is the funniest part.Drawing I would say pretty typical...  But if you are a perverted type of guy with nonsense mind...  You would love it.  Just don't go nosebleed everytime you watch the show... not particularly like is the transformation.

You would love it.  Just don't go nosebleed everytime you watch the show..."", ""Originally, I had never heard of Kanokon and would never have touched it, if not for the MAL recommendation system.  Being in the mood for another slice of life romantic comedy, I quickly acquired the series for viewing.  It's a nice short adaptation of the Light Novels of the same name.Despite the fanservice, Kanokon has some semblance of a plot.  Here, we follow the [mis]adventures of little Kouta as he faces perils of many kinds.  Now at first it seems quite episodic, something with meat in the episodes themselves with a little continuity from one to the next.  Unfortunately, it...trips up in the later episodes with the school siege which at that point seemed like the great place to end the anime ona good note, we get a few more episodes.  Now the actual ending of the anime maintains the status quo and wraps up nicely, it competes with the earlier action packed battle at school and leaves me with a bad impression.  The writers really should have known better, especially this being an adaptation.As far as the art goes, it does a great job at remaining inconsistent.  The animations shift from mediocre to surprisingly good at key moments and usually during actions scenes as well.  That's not to say the Kanokon is mediocre in its art.  In fact, it does a fine job of nailing down the setting and characters (and the Gainaxing).  It's just the way the animation shifts from time to time ticks me off.  I really wished they could have kept up the standard throughout the series but I would understand if the producers could not due to various reasons.The sound is nothing special though.  Most scenes are given adequate accompaniments.  I emphasise on most scenes since I feel some scenes would be better off with another type of song in the background, particularly the penultimate fight at school.  However, as far as sound effects go, they do go out of their way to emphasise whatever is happening on screen, so props to them.Finally, for our [arguably] beloved cast of characters, it seems only the Kouta and Chizuru seem to possess an adequate measure of development.  A pity, since the supposed rival, Nozomu, seems akin to an accessory by comparison.  It doesn't help that she's also an emotionless girl that is eerily resemblant of another quite famous quiet type I know just without the same level of depth.  Of our supporting cast, we have some small going ons here and there, but some of them are quite random, revealed, resolved and/or unexplained until the very end or near it.  That's passable because the focus seems to be on the main couple that is Kouta and Chizuru.  Kouta has his moments, readily manning up to make it through the crises.  Chizuru on the other hand, is just quite stubborn and as a sibling puts it, simple-minded.  Though that doesn't stop her from her wholehearted devotion and leading poor little Kouta on.In the end though, the silliness of it all gives way to some measure of enjoyment.  It could be the first time that Kouta and Chizuru show off some power, or it could the various fight scenes, or the Fanservice (with a capital F).  Quite an enjoyable show, if you're looking for something nice and light without too much depth to it.  However, if you have a tendency to nosebleed from anything risqué, or if you just don't need/like fanservice, or you're not in to little boys, you might want to sign this one off. trips up in the later episodes with the school siege which at that point seemed like the great place to end the anime ona good note, we get a few more episodes.  Now the actual ending of the anime maintains the status quo and wraps up nicely, it competes with the earlier action packed battle at school and leaves me with a bad impression.  The writers really should have known better, especially this being an adaptation.As far as the art goes, it does a great job at remaining inconsistent.  The animations shift from mediocre to surprisingly good at key moments and usually during actions scenes as well.  That's not to say the Kanokon is mediocre in its art.  In fact, it does a fine job of nailing down the setting and characters (and the Gainaxing).  It's just the way the animation shifts from time to time ticks me off.  I really wished they could have kept up the standard throughout the series but I would understand if the producers could not due to various reasons.The sound is nothing special though.  Most scenes are given adequate accompaniments.  I emphasise on most scenes since I feel some scenes would be better off with another type of song in the background, particularly the penultimate fight at school.  However, as far as sound effects go, they do go out of their way to emphasise whatever is happening on screen, so props to them.Finally, for our [arguably] beloved cast of characters, it seems only the Kouta and Chizuru seem to possess an adequate measure of development.  A pity, since the supposed rival, Nozomu, seems akin to an accessory by comparison.  It doesn't help that she's also an emotionless girl that is eerily resemblant of another quite famous quiet type I know just without the same level of depth.  Of our supporting cast, we have some small going ons here and there, but some of them are quite random, revealed, resolved and/or unexplained until the very end or near it.

On his first day at his new school, a beautiful second-year female student named Chizuru Minamoto asks him to meet her alone in the music room. When he arrives, she reveals that she is in fact a fox deity and from that day on the two hang out together.

I should also mention this show is NOT for kids what so ever. You see breasts, panties, and other stuff through out the entire show that are not intended for kids.One of the main characters, Chizuru, is in love with Kouta. During the course of the show Chizuru does many perverted things to him. While he likes it, he always resists it because he thinks it\'s wrong. While Chizuru starts doing these things to Kouta, the other students at their school give Kouta the nickname ""The Great Erotic King"". That\'s just one of the many goofy/erotic things during the show. Another great thing that adds to the comedy was the writing. I thought the writing was very funny and entertaining. I laughed through out the show. Every single episode made me laugh.All and all, the show was very enjoyable. While it\'s super ecchi and fan service, I just thought it was very funny. The comedy of the show is what drew me in (and maybe the ecchi stuff :P). If you love ecchi/fan service stuff, you will probably love this series.

However, I am on the contrary. This anime is one that gave me the motivation to start my adventure in search to watch all romance animes. Okay lets start. Kouta a little country boy who lived with his grandfather but comes to the city. Right of the bat we get Chizuru the youkai fox who falls in love with him. I really liked this anime because it does the opposite of what most anime do today, which leads people to say things like...""I\'m tired of waiting the whole season just for the main characters to say ""I like you"" which is usually at the end of every anime and we never get to see what happens after that. Kanokon gets straight to the point and let her know she loves him. There is fan service but what anime does not have fan service. The only bad thing I shall say was wrong is that the main protag was being gay and not wanting to get with Chizuru. However, all anime are like that.

This was one of the worst anime I have ever seen in my life, I can\'t believe I sat through this piece of crap twice; I wasted so much of my life watching this. Ok fan service is one thing but this anime is closer to hentai so it is a completely different thing.How to start this offStory: Since ecchis usually do not have a plot, I was not expecting much. Nevertheless,...the plot of this anime was bad even for ecchis standards. If you want something better watch Omamori Himari, it is an ecchi also but is better overall in all categories. I will also go on record as saying that this anime did have some decent potential where they could probably use the fusion between Kohta and Chizuru to a much favorable thing where they fight villains. But no they had to muck it up by drowning the anime completely with useless, annoying, and indecent fan service. Seriously, I would rather watch Dragon Ball Evolution. It was a crappy movie, but at least it had a point and premise. This ""anime"" is as close to hentai as humanly possible.Sound: The OP is a pretty good song, I like Phosphor. I can\'t really pick on the sound much; I did not find any real problems.Art: There is only one thing I hate about the art; they made Kohta look like a 10 year old boy. I like the eyes, also the anime is very colorful, and it does not look depressing.Characters: Oh am I going to have fun with this. I am just focusing on the main characters, because too many of the supporting characters stink.Chizuru Minamoto: This character is a slut, she is so desperate to be screwed, and it is not even funny. According to the Wikipedia page it says that she like to dress erotically for Kohta, when they are alone. Not much I can say.  She does have a personality which is more than I can say about other characters in this piece of crap series. I do have a feeling that she is a pedophile because of how she is with Kohta. The only cool thing that Chizuru does is merging with Kohta, because I do like the way he looks.Nozomu Ezomori: This character has no emotions or personality to think of. Like Chizuru, she is a very slutty character. She tries to find every opportunity to be with Kohta. For me she stoops to a new low by havingKohta drink the nine tail drink, an energy drink for yokai, where the side effect is the people drinking it fall in love with the other person, which makes Kohta fall in love with Nozomu. She is one of the many characters in the show who has no personality to their name.Kohta Oyamada: Oh, am I going to go to town with this one. First of all, I am going to go on record and say he is the worst protagonist I have ever seen in my life. I would not have had much of a problem with him if they would have drawn him out to be older. This child should grow some balls, and grow up. Also he should go down the halls of any middle school nowadays and see what the couples are doing. His grandpa is not with him so he should shut up about it and stop lingering on his past, it is so annoying.

I commend you to avoid this if you can.Summary:+If you watch for the boobs, this will work I guess.-Worst MC you'll ever seen-Supporting cats are terrible.-Basically a waste of time reading the story because the story is a TRASH-Watch hentai instead of this....Overall, a total TRAIN WRECK.

It will not disappoint.Ever thought back on the days when you were innocent and still learning about the world around you?

The personalities of the characters mix well together throughout the show and I suggest picking up where the anime leaves off with the manga series, since the anime doesn't entirely cover the story, but a good portion.The development of the characters are great. The people behind the animation of the manga did a good job at reflecting the personalities from the manga adaptation.As I've praised the music choices, the sound quality is perfect. The art of the show isn't the best, but for it's time, it was definitely near a 10.

', ""I'll warn all those who don't like to watch Echi anime stay away of course then again you wouldn't be reading this to begin with.Anyways My Review,I Gave Kanokon a 5 for their story as you could tell from the lack of a plot to begin with that this anime was not meant to have a real story and instead was filled with fanservice. If you like animes with a plot your barking up the wrong tree. It seems to me the producers tried to pick up the pace with the story towards the end...but it was all for naught as it didn't make a positive difference in my opinion. thats all I have to say about the story.The art i gave a 7 as most of the time they managed to keep the art together without completely going overbord and the way they depicted most of the scenes i found it quite amuseing. There wasn't much else to say about the art but it was all in all not the worst i've seen.For the sound i gave it a 6 i watched the english dub and the characters voices sounded ok but for the japanese i just didn't find Chizuru's voice right. Enough said.When it came to charater design and devolopement i gave it a 7 as the character designs looked fairly original to me although in character devolpoement it was just as i had suspected non existant in some cases while for others it was just to shallow and also as i said before this was more somebody way of putting their harem into a cartoon that actually putting a plot to some animations.For enjoyment an 8 because the jokes although not original fit into place when they were used. Also they manged to still make me laugh at watching it the second time through (which is rare) so it was given points for that i beleive many people will find that if your are perverted enough to get the umor you will enjoy the anime alot more.The overall raiting i gave kanokon was more like an average because all in all i think it was about a 7 not that bad not great but enjoyoble to watch. If you don't really like echi animes you probably shouldn't watch this as it is just that (a perverted anime) of course you probaly wouldn't still be reading this if you didn't like it. but it was all for naught as it didn't make a positive difference in my opinion. thats all I have to say about the story.The art i gave a 7 as most of the time they managed to keep the art together without completely going overbord and the way they depicted most of the scenes i found it quite amuseing.

An older girl, Chizuru, (obviously hot) has an obsession with him and does perverted things around him. She wants him to beg for her most precious part of her body (the one she flaunts around, but say Kouta is only allowed to fondle them and stare at them. Another girl, Nozomu, wants to claim him as her own. She is much smaller and...flat-chested. The only thing keeping this story slightly alive is the commentary by Kiriko and YukiArt - I thought the art was fine. It wasn't one of which the art looked like it came out of a 90's or early 2000's anime. It didn't have dull color and it did have some parts that wouldn't be considered hentai, but do keep it under the close eye of ecchi.Sound - The voice actors did not do a bad job. Kouta's did sound a bit airy but I did like how innocent he sounded. I realize Nozomu's voice was meant to be a bit robotic (being she's a spirit and reminded me of another anime character), but I did not quite like it how stale it sounded.Character - The character's all had their unique personality traits...- Kouta was an embarrassed, and innocent short boy who didn't want to give in to his overall feelings for Chizuru.- Chizuru, who claimed she only felt for Kouta, would walk around the school feelin only the slight embarrassment in a scandalous outfit. She was very flirtatious.Nozomu - Was a very unknowing girl who acted like Julie Sigtuna from Absolute Duo. She did not know much of what the human race considered something and she seemed overall like that character.Enjoyment - I did enjoy this anime. It was happy at the end with Tayura and Akane, Kouta admitting his feelings, and it just felt refreshing after yelling at Kouta through the screen to just choose. I honestly did ship him with Chizuru, although at moments I shipped Chizuru and Nozomu...OVERALL: The thing that kept me going was how hot Saku was... That episode I missed him... He left and I was wondering if we would ever see him again. He was my favorite... I liked this anime... If you were wondering, but maybe it should choose a plot line and give them more character... Not just a flat character.~ SweetMoko flat-chested. The only thing keeping this story slightly alive is the commentary by Kiriko and YukiArt - I thought the art was fine.

I honestly did ship him with Chizuru, although at moments I shipped Chizuru and Nozomu...OVERALL: The thing that kept me going was how hot Saku was... That episode I missed him... He left and I was wondering if we would ever see him again. He was my favorite... I liked this anime... If you were wondering, but maybe it should choose a plot line and give them more character... Not just a flat character.~ SweetMoko"", 'Ecchi anime isn\'t known for its strong plots or deep characters, but this one doesn\'t even try.  The storyline is sub-par, and the writing is awful.  Despite that, it\'s worth a few laughs, and the occasional ""They can\'t be going there!"" moments (one word: cake).  Despite the amateur quality of its visuals, sounds, and plot, it still ends up being a fairly enjoyable ecchi anime if you don\'t mind feeling yourself getting stupider as you watch it.Story: 3Chizuru the fox-girl tries to get into the hero\'s pants.  Nozomu the wolf-girl tries to steal him away from her.  Repeat for twelve...episodes.  Throw in the occasional magical battle and obligatory beach and hot springs episodes, and that\'s the whole plot of the anime.  Yes, it\'s that dumb.There are plenty of parts that make you wonder if you missed something earlier.  For instance, why is Chizuru so infatuated with Kouta in the first place?  And what\'s with that loli villainess that shows up for a few episodes?  It never fully explains some things that seem like they should be important.But seriously, Kouta should just be a man and take Chizuru up on her offer.Art: 4The whole show has a slightly amateur feel to it.  The artwork is sub-par, but not so bad you really notice it.  For some reason, the hero looks like he should still be in elementary school, not high school.  I guess Chizuru and Nozomu have a thing for younger boys.  That\'s right, the fox and the wolf are cougars!Notes on fanservice: Some episodes employ strategic censoring, some show everything.  And some show heart-shaped nipples.  (WTF!)Sound: 5I like the opening theme.  It\'s nothing special at first, but after hearing it several times, it kind of grows on you.  Then there\'s the tango that starts up whenever sexy stuff happens.  For some reason, it makes me laugh every time.On the other hand, the English dub is pretty lame.  Chizuru has an annoyingly breathy Marilyn Monroe voice, and most of the other characters aren\'t much better.  There is one exception, however.  I actually like Nozomu\'s monotone.  I know the emotionless girl is fairly typical for ecchi animes, but somehow hearing it in English makes it hilarious, especially when she calls Chizuru names in that matter-of-fact tone.Characters: 4Honestly, the characters are pretty dumb.  Chizuru is an oversexed magical fox-girl who is constantly trying to seduce the hero, and that pretty much sums up her personality for the entire show.  There\'s really nothing more to her.  Nozomu the wolf-girl also has a thing for the hero, though it never explains why except that he tried to do something nice for her when they first met.  And she likes his smell.Enjoyment: 7Based upon my review above you might think I hate this show, but I actually like it quite a lot.  Kanokon does everything wrong, but somehow still ends up being a lot of fun.  I think part of its charm is that it\'s not one you get emotionally involved with; you can just kick back and watch an episode or two without any expectations.Overall: 5It has a lot of weaknesses, but its sheer entertainment value makes up for them.

If you do not wish to watch porn don't watch this. Kanokon is a great fan-service anime. It never takes it's self too seriously and gives a satisfying conclusion and has nudity. If you're looking for pee in my asshole go watch something else. If you want a lighthearted fan-service romance anime with lots of fan-service and nudity then this is your show. MAL Wants me to write a longer review for some stupid ass reason. I've summarized why this show is worthy of watching. Why are you making me write a 40 page thesis on it you fucking bastards. "", '*Probably some spoilers in this reviewKanokon is the story of a 400 year old fox girl who really badly wants to have sex with a thirteen year old boy. This leads to all sorts of shenanigans as Kouta and Chizuru try to make there forbidden human/fox spirit love a reality.Some of the deep plots which explore what it really means to be human are as follows; Kouta gets a bracelet stuck on his arm which makes it so he can\'t get horny anymore, Chizuru\'s ""sister"" (The snow person) threatens to kills hundreds of high school students in order to test Kouta and Chizuru\'s love, and...Chizuru\'s boobs disappear. All these arcs really make you think and take a good look in the mirror at your life. Even after completed this series I found myself thinking what did it really represent when Chizuru\'s lost her boobs to a magic potion, and what would I do if I was in the same position as Kouta (With women throwing themselves all over me for no particular reason).Not only did this series have an interesting narrative, the character development was superb as well. Kouta, for example, goes through some very interesting changes as he begins to learn and grow. At the beginning of the series he is dead against having Chizuru shove her tits in his face 24/7. He sees it as an everyday annoyance that he just has to deal with, but as the series progresses he comes to the realization that perhaps he doesn\'t mind all that much if he has breasts in his face. We can see this when he asks Chizuru to do it to him.Even though the character Kouta\'s arc would usually be enough to warrant a 7 or 8 out of 10 for the series the creators of this anime didn\'t stop there. Here are some of the other characters whose arcs really touched me on an emotional level:Nozomu starts out as an emotionless girl who feels as though she doesn\'t need help from anybody but herself. After meeting Kouta, however, she turns into an emotionless girl who really wants to have sex with Kouta.Chizuru also has some interesting development in this anime. In the beginning she believes that Kouta was hers and hers alone but later on realizes that maybe a threesome with Nozomu wouldn\'t be that bad after all.The last, and my personal favorite, character arc belongs to Nozomu\'s older brother, Saku. When he first reunites with Chizuru he feels that he must have her. In order to accomplish he tries to put a stake in between the relationship of Kouta and Chizuru. This only changes after Kouta and Chizuru join together and beat him up. Only at that point does Saku begin to realize how wrong he was and how true the love between these two actually is.Overall, this series really made me think about my life and if I\'m actually following the right path. Even writing this review stirs up many emotions that were brought on by this series. I give this series without a doubt 10/10. Chizuru\'s boobs disappear.

I have no idea, I have nothing else to highlight about this anime, there's nothing else about it, literally, so please MAL, just let me post my review. "", ""The reviews I see of this anime are all judging it by the same standards you would judge any regular anime, but this is the very opposite of a regular anime. This is the prime example of the perfect trash ecchi, and I love this anime for that. There is no story, the art is very mid-quality and mid-2000s , the sound.... is pretty good to be honest (the OP is pretty good), and the characters are like Nozomu's chest- flat. But! Just because this anime has almost no substance does not mean it is not enjoyable. Watching this show in an ironic, non serious...light has been the best experience I have ever had watching anime. The show is filled to the brim with fanservice, but even as someone who does not enjoy breasts in the slightest, watching these dumb scenes with characters being and acting stupid absolutely slays me. The dub voice acting is terrible (especially Tayura who sounds like the physical manifestation of 'not trying at all'), but it gives the anime an extra layer of 'trashy charm' which makes it even more enjoyable. If you are in the mood for a real show full of actual story and character relations then either go read the manga or watch something else. But if you are in for an experience of fanservice so stupid you bust out laughing, plot so non-existent that it gives full freedom to make as many jokes as possible at the show's expense, and lines of dialogue so outrageous you can't help but rewind, then watch Kanokon, you will not regret it. light has been the best experience I have ever had watching anime.

I watched 6 episodes hoping for it to get better and it never did. In fact, the only reason I even did finish it was because a friend jokingly dared me to, and I'm no bitch.

It was that classic kawaii style that has become all to popular.  Even though this is true, I still think the character models are supper cute and what\'s not to love about that.  The art was more or less average; I have no complaints about it.  Art is a 5.2.Sound...- Literally every part of the soundtrack for this show made me want to smash my face in a meat grinder.  IT WAS GOD AWFUL.  Every part of the soundtrack made me feel awful except for one part, the love theme.  The theme that included the piano was beautiful and surprisingly it conveyed emotions to me.  I\'m giving the sound a 3.  Honestly I should give it a 2 but that piano love theme was just awesome.3.Character - Any character development that should have been in this show was replaced with boobs.  I mean that quite literally.  The only thing the characters had going for them was their cuteness and their boob sizes.  But there ain\'t nothin\' wrong with that.  A 5 for boob sizes and kawaii.  Oh yeah and there was also some romance but, whatever.4.Story - The story of this show is put together pretty poorly.  The main characters are thrown random obstacles to overcome and it made for a wishy-washy story.  I must say though, the romance did make more ground than the actual ""enemy struggle"" that was faced.  The romance at first was just boobs being thrust into the main characters face but by the end of the anime I felt  a little bit of a relationship forming.  The actual struggle against the show\'s enemies was not good but for a romance it was not that bad, so on that basis I\'ll give a 6 for the story.5.Enjoyment - If anyone watches this show and expects a mature story they must be a complete dumb ass.  That being said, I enjoy kicking back and watching a less-serious anime once in a while, and I actually enjoyed how ""less-serious"" this anime was.  If you just wanna chill and not get involved with a super heavy story this show is perfect for you.  I don\'t think that shows like this should be taken very seriously and I believe if you approach shows like this in a different way you will end up enjoying it.

However, I soon noticed Kouta Oyamada loves Chizuru Minamoto, but he is too shy and innocent but has no back-bone, so he will to keep his innocent seems to disappear with time.This story is touching but that is assuming you don't miss...the big yet almost hidden picture of the story, I think the Ecchi good, but I feel the Ecchi hides the story if you force too much on Chizuru Minamoto's acts and not enough on Kouta Oyamada's acts.there two main stories of this anime based on your pov, the more boring and every disgusting is the one I see most people gave reviews on, but I think more hidden story is truly lovely, tho if I had not noticed it, I would not be write this review, try looking all the pov's of any anime you will fine things you would have missed. If you didn't like this anime or even if you did, try seeing the hidden pov. the big yet almost hidden picture of the story, I think the Ecchi good, but I feel the Ecchi hides the story if you force too much on Chizuru Minamoto's acts and not enough on Kouta Oyamada's acts.there two main stories of this anime based on your pov, the more boring and every disgusting is the one I see most people gave reviews on, but I think more hidden story is truly lovely, tho if I had not noticed it, I would not be write this review, try looking all the pov's of any anime you will fine things you would have missed.

This anime is perverted and fits well with the Ecchi genres it securely fits itself in. I remember watching this when I was about 13 to 14 years old, locking the door, with my earbuds in so no-one would hear the dialogue of the anime. I decided to re-watch it to find out how well it stands out, and then I realized, it sort of does.Story: 5Of course this isn\'t what stands out, its an Ecchi....The only plot I was able to find basically can be summarized in one sentence. ""The seduction of a young boy by a fox demon and the obstacles they must face to preserve their relationship"". Any other plot came in too late, what with a little demon child showing up and making the Main heroine\'s large boobs disappear through a unknown solution of which supposedly she could preserve her ""Oni-chan"", or the Main character to be precise from the heroine temptations and seal her powers for easy termination.Art: 10Ecchis are basically all art to put it simply, and this is no exception. Everything is drawn beautifully or sensually, with many mixtures of light and dark colors to match the mood of the current feelings or status of characters. Every character could have appeared very sexy, beautiful, handsome, cute, or any of the aboveSound: 9Also where most Ecchis succeed in my opinion. The intro is decent, but I prefer the outro to be honest. Also the characters voices match quite well, with the exception of the English dub, of which blows ass and keeps this category from being a 10. Just stick to subs or plain Japanese.Character: 8Surprisingly, there\'s actually is some pretty decent characters within the show. For example, Kouta is a wimpy, shy, but warm-hearted, smart, and a downright good person who can take responsibility whenever Chizuru doesn\'t instantly molest him. Another is Chizuru\'s brother, Tayura, who must tolerate all of his sister\'s pettiness and constant bickering, just so he can live a happy life in hopes of gaining the confidence to confess to his high school crush, Akane, who has a no nonsense view of things and constantly gives him a hard time. I often found myself rooting for the side characters more than Chizuru herself, since sometimes she acts like a brat that doesn\'t get her way.Enjoyment: 8Besides the constant attempted rapes and molestations by Chizuru to Kouta, I found myself chuckling quite often in the simple absurdity most of our characters must deal with on a daily basis. The beginning is no better than the rest of the anime (of which isn\'t bad) but leaves a lot to be desired by the end due to a new character being introduced formally near the end.This is one of a few Ecchi animes I will recommend since it isn\'t terrible or boring and does try to keep the watchers attention (in a good way) The only plot I was able to find basically can be summarized in one sentence.

Don\'t ask, I seriously have no clue why.  Kanokon is one of those things that I have done this strange phenomenon on.Story (2.99/10):  Kouta, our main protagonist has been thrown into this world of Youkai, where a girl by the name of Chizuru has confessed to him saying that she loves him, while at the same time, revealing that she is a fox youkai.  After some damage to the school, he is thrown into a new life...where he must now deal with the threat of Youkai, and the girl that is now at his side.For starters, that synopsis is pretty accurate to both the light novels and manga, but not the anime.  For this anime adaptation, the story is absolute shite.  Not only does this anime not follow the story, it diverts into a different path completely.  What the anime focuses on for basically the entire show, are side stories.  Practically every episode is a different story altogether, leading up to a quite unsatisfying ending that felt very cliched.What is also a major problem of this anime, is the fact that little to no things are explained.  Unless you have read a good chunk of the manga or light novel, you probably will not understand what exactly is going on in the series, or even who the characters are.  The anime does such a terrible job explaining who side characters in the story are, that it is very likely to forget what their names are.As a cohesive story, this anime is a complete and utter mess.  Almost every episode is a completely different thing, and most of the actual anime is focused on ecchi material rather than an actual story.  However, as an episodic anime, well, it\'s still not very good even if thought of that way, but it makes it sound a bit better.Overview-  Unexplained plot-  Terrible story cohesion-  Mostly side stories rather than actual plotCharacters (4.10/10):  While the story was bad, the characters aren\'t much better in comparison.  But they have something going for them, I suppose...Kouta Oyamada is our main protagonist in the series.  looking like a grade schooler, this guy gets pretty much no character beyond what you are given in the first episode.  Watch him cringe, watch him run away, watch him struggle to breathe under Chizuru\'s gigantic DD mounds!  (That happens in every episode BTW.)  I guess what he has really going for him in terms of character development is getting a bit more perverted...but regardless, he\'s not really that good of a character.Chizuru Minamoto is the main female protagonist in the series.  To put it short, she basically spends the entirety of the series trying to get Kouta\'s D inside of her.  In every episode, she shows everyone that she has no shame in her body, by shoving Kouta\'s face into her breasts, and getting pissed whenever nothing happens the way she wants to.  (I.E. everyone cockblocking her)  Apart from that, she rarely shows her youkai self in the anime, to the point that the anime didn\'t really feel like a show about animal spirits and demons.  But rather, a generic, poorly written slice of life.And finally, Nozomu Ezomori.  One word, cockblocker.  Without a doubt, this wolf girl\'s only purpose in this anime is to get in between the non-existent romance that tries to exist.  While emotionless and basically eating as much meat as she can fit in her mouth.  (Dear lord, I disappoint myself.)  There\'s not really much to her, at all.For side characters, we have a bunch.  Every character from Chizuru\'s brother Tayura, the class rep Asahina, and the various ""antagonists"" (I use that word lightly) that show up and disappear from existence, are all not very detailed and are more or less single trait garbage.  Many characters in this show have little explanation for their existence in the show, and overall, feel quite pointless to begin with.Overview:+/-  Interesting main characters....-  Characters that felt randomly put in-  One note charactersArt and Sound (6.51/10 and 5.21/10):  While the story and characters aren\'t incredibly well done, the art is actual somewhat decent.The art, while mostly moe style, actually looks rather nice from its 2008 time period.  The characters look rather well drawn, nothing looked very jarring in terms of animation, and the overall style of it looked rather pleasing.On the topic of art, we have to talk about the fanservice as well.  For a good large chunk of the series, you will see Chizuru topless, to say the least.  The fanservice takes a good large chunk of every episode and depending on what your view of fanservice is, you may or may not want to even begin the show.  Everything from panty shots, seemingly impossible breast physics, to bathing and just baring it all, this series goes above and beyond with its fanservice. (They do show nipple, and very openly at that, so be wary of that.)For music, well, it\'s not terrible.  To explain it a bit more, the anime has some songs that sound good.  The music isn\'t terrible, but it\'s not one of those good stuck in your head songs.  Personally, I never bothered to listen to the tracks after the first episode of knowing what they sound like.Overview:+/-  Moe style artwork.  (This of course depends on your view of moe.)+/-  Quite heavy amounts of fanservice.  (This as well, depends on your view of fanservice.)+/-  Decent sounding music.Enjoyment (5.96/10): I am personally a fan of mythology based shows.  Particularly, ones about fox spirits or, the ever so well-known nine-tailed fox.  (Naruto doesn\'t count.)  For Kanokon, well, I have mixed feelings about it.Did I enjoy it?Well, yes, to a certain extent.  I\'ve gotten used to fanservice, so the idea of seeing breasts shoved into one guy\'s face was nothing new to me.  I also love the idea of fox animal girls, so that sort of made me continue watching it.Was it a good show?Well, no.  It was terrible.  The plot and the characters were terribly executed and did not make itself into a good show.  Many plot holes existed in the show, as it focused way too much of fanservice rather than any actual proper plot.Was it unwatchable?Well, not necessarily.  If you\'re a fan, or don\'t mind bad plot or fanservice, than this show is fine to watch.  Personally, I wasn\'t turned away by it, so I was able to watch it the full way through.Would I recommend you to watch it?Well, that depends.  If you don\'t mind fanservice, go ahead.  But, if you do mind, than I would suggest you look elsewhere.Overall Score: (5.22/10) where he must now deal with the threat of Youkai, and the girl that is now at his side.For starters, that synopsis is pretty accurate to both the light novels and manga, but not the anime.

So the anime is kinda ecchi, but in most of those scenes I think there wasen't that much that stepped over the line and was actually more funny so you kinda let it slide.Also the character's personalities really help keep the story going and along the way you start getting into the anime. But that's all i'm gonna say, don't think my comment was that helpful but I felt I had to put in a comment after what I read.Anyway if you can't handle a touch or a splash into the ecchi genre...that you should not watch this. that you should not watch this."", 'hm mmi wish i could rate this one 6.5 because it does not desers a 7 nor should it be scored 6.i dont know if its just me but i truely dont like weak male characters just stop drawing these characters people!but to be honest it is a faily good combination of ecchi fantasy and comedy is again fairly goodand it does not fall short on ecchi part believe you meeven if it is just for ecchi comedy watch this one you probably wont regret itthere is one character that particularly makes the whole anime worth watching and cracks you up and it the girl...that shape shifts to wolfthe whole you wont regret watching this and remember one of funny characters basically sums the whole review up!i hope this helped you! that shape shifts to wolfthe whole you wont regret watching this and remember one of funny characters basically sums the whole review up!i hope this helped you!', ""Ok I have to admit that I enjoyed this story, even though it was just full of fan service. If I had to re-live my junior high school years I would die of happiness if I had these two girls fighting over me all the way through.There is quite a bit of humor woven into the plot and I found myself laughing out loud several times in each episode. I am guessing it will never be extended to a second season, but it was a fun ride to the end. I most enjoyed seeing the character development of our heroine Chizuru as we find...out about her crazy family, and as she beats back various magical relative's interests in her boyfriend.
