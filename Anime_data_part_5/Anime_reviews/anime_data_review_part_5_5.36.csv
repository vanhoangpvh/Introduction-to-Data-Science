Freezing Vibration Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21373/Freezing_Vibration_Specials,"[""Well, in my perspective, these (i only watched 1 so far) dont count as OVA...it's more like soft-H version of the Freezing, with new Vibration chars. Because not only they dont have any stories...it also not too propriate to watch them in public.Overall the art is the same as the original.4 stars for you who's looking for fan service (5 stars would be full-H for me)1 star for you who seeks some side stories "", 'OK , these are 3 min special episode !!So let me make it clear what special means and what these episodes are selling ?Take any anime , specials are side episode different that original story that offer alternative timeline , comedy or simply are for fan service .Therefore , if you are here for some plot , go away and do not down rate this anime just because you were expecting something else .These episode offer but one thing , that is fan service . If you are here for some oppai glory , this is going to make you drown...in it . This episodes are mirror of how some fans wanted to see their beloved characters . in it . This episodes are mirror of how some fans wanted to see their beloved characters .', ""If you like ALOT of fan service then this is for you, I myself don't really enjoy it too much and it causes me to lose focus.The characters were the same as always but somewhat out of character due to the fact it's all naked stuff. I personally enjoy the series for the sorry line and these specials strayed far from the original story leaving me somewhat disappointed, although specials usually do, they tend to at least eight try and stay on track but these ones seemed messy to me and so totally random I actually was glad they were only 2-3 minutes long.

Exception,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49163/Exception,"[""Animation's framerate is not high so watching it on 1.5 speed really helps show to be enjoyable.There are multiple science-fiction genres in this show.Biotechnology and neuroscience is super advanced, space travel and physics are also advanced. Has is own unique atmosphere.Each character has differences and unique principle.There is also one more thing which is too important; printing weapons is forbidden besides they do not want to solve their problem with complete violence. But you will see progression of how and when they decided to switch to brute force. Storyline was good and immersive. It was not cliche. However ending was not unique. "", ""I ended up watching this on a whim just seeing a picture pop up of a new show. It's pretty short at only 8 episodes, so I found this to be a nice off-hand pick. I went in with no expectations and came out feeling worth the time I spent watching it.Art & Design - So everyone picks on 3D animation (myself included) but I enjoyed this one a lot. The chosen art style (which I love) really fits the 3D style, so I got used to it pretty quickly and it felt unique enough to warrant me noticing and enjoying the style. (Though sometimes...I keep thinking it's like 3D Tim Burton for the new age)Characters & Story - This isn't mind blowing, it's not going to grip you by the throat or pluck heart strings, but I felt the story was good enough to hold it's own. Not amazing, but fine. The characters were well created, I feel, and had believable personalities and all felt different and substantial. For people who are into the sci-fi genre this is probably going to be a good watch for you! (Again, it's only 8 episodes, it's worth the time to invest due to it's smaller size)Overall Takeaway - 8 episodes of sci-fi with a unique *cough*Tim Burton*cough* art style put together with 3D animation that's not bad. Story that's enjoyable but not amazing, and interesting characters that fit in the story well.Recommended. Cheers and have a good day!

The truth is this show is solid 7-8.Art is unique but far cry from being bad, want to see whats actually bad? Take a look at Berserk. The artstyle here reminds lf mix between Land of lustrous and low budget Arcane so of course it could have been better but its not unpleasant to watch.Story is quite decent with some interesting albeit a bit predictable plot twists. Its complete. A solid complete story for...scifi fans, what else there is to say?The characters felt a bit lacking even though they were the focus for 90% of the show, lack of interaction, comradeship, their past and that sort of thing. Given the length of episodes I hoped for more especially given their early introductions.Music and sound design is honestly great, delivers the sci-fi vibe very well and sends down shivers during colder scenes.In conclusion, if you are scifi fan, go watch. And even if you are not and looking for something solid to watch, go for it. scifi fans, what else there is to say?The characters felt a bit lacking even though they were the focus for 90% of the show, lack of interaction, comradeship, their past and that sort of thing.

And they hired a famous musician named Ryuichi Sakamoto to compose the Music. The English Release of the anime also stars some famous VAs such as Nolan North as Lewis, Ali Hillis as Nina, Robbie Daymond as Mack aka David Bowie, and Laura Bailey...as Kate and the ship voiceover. The ones for Oscar and Patty, Eugene Bryd and Nadine Nicole are on camera actors who makes their voiceover debut here but managed to give pretty competent voice performances as well.I was pretty skeptical myself going in, but ended up finding myself interested thanks to the ongoing mystery and twists. And the Finale is pretty Bittersweet but gives Closure. If you can get past the fact this show is in 3D CGI and the Designs, viewers might be in for a nice scifi watch. as Kate and the ship voiceover.

It did'nt fit with the theme while it could've been better, like for example in Ling Long or Hei Men, if we want to talk about 3d scifis.The...story and character building was mediocre too. A team of 4 crew members, arrive with their spacecraft at a new planet that is to be terraformed, in order to make it livable for the future, since humans are forced to leave Earth and migrate. We've seen this concept so often in scifis, simple plot (even in boargames like Terraforming Mars haha).Anyway the story focuses on each member of the team, that is made by a biological 3D printer but during the printing process of a member, something wrong happens and as a result, a new hybrid is made (which to be honest, was the only likable character in the series). So the rest of the members, are called to take some decisions until they reach the surface of the new planet but each one, has their own goals and different personalities.Another funny thing was also that 3D printing of weapons in the ship wasn't allowed to avoid violence, while we know that someone, can use even a fork as weapon.Anyway, so overall, MIXED FEELINGS because it felt like watching a short soap opera, with predictable dramas, tiwsts, betrayals and some romance, unwrapped during the journey. But for only 8 episodes (and with the faster speed option) with -at least- a complete story, I guess you have nothing to lose. If you are hooked, feel free to try it, but have in mind that there are other better scifis out there, like the 3d ones I said above and many more, worth watching and which stay in your mind. story and character building was mediocre too.

I would like to counter those opinions with the fact that the build up was the most important part not the ending itself. Sure you could say the ending was mediocre, i guess. But all the morale dilemmas, the tackling of existential crisis amongst most of the characters, etc. is whats the most beautiful part to me.so basically what im saying is that if you arent a stickler for animation quality and you dont mind an ending that is just used as a means to an end rather than...the gem of the show. THEN youd love the show like i did.tldr; its a show that caters to people who love sci-fi psychological horror (in the sense of existential dread and morale dilemmas) and you will hate it if you cannot get past the animation quality WHICH is only bad for the characters animation. just saying. the characters are the only bad part of the animation... the gem of the show.

I personally don't hate 3d anime and actually think they can be enjoyable rather than outright denying their worth. In the anime community 3D CGI anime are frowned upon like a curse but there are exceptions like Beastars and Houseki no kuni (Just to name a few).So I'll appreciate if you read this review and watch this anime with an open and appreciative lens.The story is basically similar to among us, What would happen if a group of strangers suddenly woke up on a spaceship out in space and were clueless...about why they're there or who they are. The plot alone sounds convincing enough right? Well it definitely maintains its mystery and thriller aspect as the people on the spaceship try to figure out their purpose. But all is not what is seems, Dont worry I wont give you any spoilers because this is a story meant to be experienced as spoiler free as possible. There are some plot twists aswell which are the most part nicely executed. It has a good production value and nice sound design. Especially for a show like this, which is set in the bleakness of space, Sound design matters a lot and there's an eerie vibe to it. The staff definitely nailed the stranded alone in space vibe.Now let's come to the one glaring negative, While the 3d CGI isn't bad by any means. Sometimes the framerate or whatever its called (sorry I'm not an expert at this) drops really low. As a result of this drop the scenes feel somewhat laggy at times but thankfully it doesnt take away from the show as a whole.Its definitely an underrated gem in my opinion because I've never seen anyone talk about it which is the reason why I'm writing this review haha.I'll recommend binging this in one sitting because the pacing and the surprises will definitely feel better that way.Thanks for reading! about why they're there or who they are.

At least Make My Day was sometimes funny bad and had a fairly decent pace to it even if it occasionally crashed into a wall, this show is so slow paced that if a competent studio had worked on it, they could\'ve got it out...as a 1 or 2 part OVA.The story is simple enough, humanity has left earth and ahead of the main colony ships, they\'ve sent a ship with a crew of 5 experts to get the planet ready for them. These people are ""re-prints"" though, basically clones that are grown after the ship has got close to the target area but during the printing, a solar flare causes one of the 5 to mutate into a half-human, half-something.The 5 characters are some of the ugliest characters I\'ve seen, not just because of the poor animation, but just their general character designs are hideous. They\'re also generally all interchangeable, less because they all have similar personality types, just the show routinely has characters change personality for whatever point of the storyline we\'re currently serving.The main storyline for the first half of the show is ""Should we kill the mutant?"" and nearly every character takes their turn saying ""Yes, we should"" and shortly after ""No, we shouldn\'t, it\'s murder!"" It doesn\'t matter that the mutant has already killed (which doesn\'t matter  because they just get instantly cloned again, which yes, does make the fear of death totally pointless). There are several conversations on the ethics of killing the mutant because ""He\'s still TECHNICALLY a human"" even as he growls and runs around smashing pieces of the ship and trying to kill them.It\'s like a long and drawn out remake of Alien, but without the likable characters or interesting villain. Every single time they\'re about to kill him, something just happens to occur in time to change someone\'s mind about killing him or for him to escape. It gets so tedious as it keeps repeating on a loop.When they\'ve beaten that dead horse for awhile, they suddenly decide to reveal that there is a traitor among them, which then causes the mutant (who basically is just human again because he saw a necklace from his girlfriend) and the newly cloned version of himself to team up to try and find the traitor. Cut to more everyone arguing, changing their minds constantly and turning on eachother until the big reveal... that it was the most obvious character. The show has 5 characters. We have the main character, the mutant, the nice father guy, the angry obvious red herring and then the other woman who keeps messing with their plans. It was pretty obvious to guess.It then falls into a trope I hate, once the woman is found to be the bad guy she starts acting crazier and more evil like someone flicked a light switch.One of the biggest issues the show has is that these characters are just clones, which is one of the central themes but it also diffuses most of the tension. ""Oh no, Mack died - Oh, he\'s back, nevermind."" ""Oh no, Nina di-, oh she\'s already back, nevermind."" ""Oh no Lewis is a monstrous mutant, should we kill him? Well, let\'s just create a new clone of him in the meantime."" It\'s hard to have a dramatic death when the character is just a clone sent out on a mission where they will die terraforming a planet long before anyone arrives, and one of the people arriving will be their original. It also makes it more awkward that despite several characters being re-cloned throughout the show, everyone is so against killing people trying to actively murder them or destroy the mission even though when people die they\'re back within minutes of screentime.The show then just kind of ends. The planet is terraformed and the last of the clones dies of old age long before the other humans arrive. I\'d rather they have failed because that would have at least been a tiny bit interesting, but we couldn\'t even get that, they just succeed and the story ends in the most basic way possible.Had to watch at 1.5x speed and ended up skipping through a lot of conversations of them just discussing how they can terraform the planet or the 18th discussion about the ethics of killing the mutant. If it was a 40 minute OVA or maybe a 2 parter, it\'d maybe get a 3 or 4 but at 8 episodes with the last being a double episode, it was painful to sit through. as a 1 or 2 part OVA.The story is simple enough, humanity has left earth and ahead of the main colony ships, they\'ve sent a ship with a crew of 5 experts to get the planet ready for them.

Anyway, point is, even tho I\'m a weeb, I\'m still not used to sci-fi, much less when it comes to outer space. So, this review is rather amateurish so bear with me.I felt a pull to my heart on some of the characters when they fulfilled their purpose after their last breath, which is something I didn\'t expect and that I would connect and relate to them. I love space...movies, so I watched this anime just because the setting is outer space.  It\'s 3D, which is why most anime fans wouldn\'t prefer but I still watched it anyway just for a different experience.Going back to the main topic, I didn\'t know how to feel about the main character Nina at first but her last moments are the events that got me to love her. For Mack, I like this dude, he\'s not that particularly unique, I don\'t even remember if he has any flashbacks to have a peek at his backstory but w/o even that, they still managed to make me like him by giving us the idea that he has his own principle, values, and purpose. Lewes too, I feel a lot for this dude, you get it too.One aspect I didn\'t like was the execution and the emphasis on their surroundings. It\'s close to nitpicking if it comes to the latter but the execution is severely lacking. I don\'t know exactly what execution means but I\'ll write as if I understand the general idea. They could have put more emphasis and foreshadowing. I didn\'t even know Patty has her own printing machine(?), or I just miss it during my watch, they made it appear as if ""Wahaha, I got printed first before you so know I\'m ahead of you,"" it\'s something you use whenever you just need to fit in the gap and appear as if it was smartly done. They could have shown hints here and there but they mostly didn\'t.The ending tho, the ending left a long-lasting impression, it was worth it I thought while watching the greeneries unfold within the screen. It was a fine ending, with nothing left to be unsatisfied about.It was good, not that bad or amazing. It\'s something I might forget after a year or two but might retain more than that who knows. movies, so I watched this anime just because the setting is outer space.

Why isn't there an audience for it?For starters, the story seems pretty normal in retrospect. A crew is sent on a mission towards an unknown planned, but something goes wrong, and somebody seems to be the culprit. In that sense, it seems normal to dismiss it as “Among us the anime”, but there's something weird that pulled me into the atmosphere instantly. These people aren't conventional humans.Born from a 3D printer womb, right from the beginning, every character asks the questions that one needs to. How human...are they? And how human is the monster that was born from the same womb? It's an existential series that poses questions about identity in the midst of scientific advancement. At the same time, having a thriller narrative about culprits, schemes, and being one step from each other in this claustrophobic environment. Incredible writing, tight, slow-burner that uses the 8 episodes to its maximum potential. It's an incredibly solid series, if it was simply by its writing, and pacing, but of course, there's the filter. People can't stand the animation or ending.I'll forever defend the animation, and art-style from the series. Memorable designs, every single character having a different color scheme, pretty expressive in a down-to-earth, realistic sense. Sure, it's stiff at times, but it visually conveys every character without need for explanations on personality. My biggest, and only problem, are the long, sometimes weird fight scenes. Characters gain a strange move which only activates when the plot requires it to; allowing them to win out of nowhere. However, I never felt as if it was stupid, or ugly, just incredibly stylized. It doesn't search realism, more of an artificial feel to it, which fits the series perfectly.The music, on the other hand, I usually don't notice it. It's something I instantly felt attracted to, mesmerized even. Ethereal, larger than life, galactic, but incredibly claustrophobic at other times, while not missing the uncanny nature in the concepts. 61 tracks, and there's not a single one that manipulates emotions.I have some issues though, not with the ending, but with one character that changes drastically after a reveal. I'd hope, even with changes in the narrative, characters remain entirely consistent, instead of how dramatic it becomes from that. The ending, maybe just the heavy narration which could've been cut. I know that without it, I'd get what was going on. The directing is pretty good, so there's no need for it.TLDR; I thoroughly enjoyed the series, and I hope more people can give it a shot. It's incredibly paced, well written, great designs, only if you aren't close-minded with the animation and art-style. Mesmerizing music, and a plot that made me think close to those “existential crisis” concepts.8.3/10. Man, what an underrated gem. are they?

If all anime-style shows looked like this then the community would die. The show is short and spends a lot of time walking around and talking for a very simple plot.Story: Humans travel to new world > Humans can't survive subspace > 3d print new humans (cloning, just say cloning) > bad people...got mixed in with good who want to stop this > good guys that know genocide is about to happen on new planet hide data > line between good and bad is blurred > bad guys hurt project > Good guys mess up the ship with 1 hit to the port side > original inhabitants of planet die and bad guys fail > good guys successfully kill off a planet to make a new home and happy music plays > all good guys do is to help guys dead wife come back.The art looks okay, but the characters look horrendous. The character design is some of the worst I have seen in a long time, it looks like treasure planet on meth. In 2022 designers should be ashamed to put out designs like this.The sound is boring, dull and doesn't do anything. The chances it has to be cinematic just fall through in quality.The development of characters is so basic and cliche that it just feels like they are talking to you like you are dumb. Everyone's personality is summed up in 30 seconds and no one does anything you could care about.In the end, because the story was okay and the background is good and because there are worst shows than this even though they are setting the bar really low here I give it a 3/10. I feel like that is generous, to be honest. This is not worthy of a big name being involved nor of 2022.

The series has a very interesting premise, that of a human printer, I thought that was fantastic. But the series stops there. All the logistics and psychology about the printer, it's very interesting.But it's 8 episodes, and they thought that was a good number. The whole story could be told in a 1h30min film, even risking playing it in the cinema before streaming, but watching it you understand the reason for not going to the cinema.The series literally is interesting in the eps 1, 2, 7 e 8I didn't love the design,...but I thought it was really good but I thought it was really good"", ""Honestly, I believe this is why people don't enjoy Netflix shows. This show could have been way better if it had better marketing and animation put in motion. Overall this show asks the question of should humans have the ultimate ability to print each other through their science.Besides it's overall poor choice in animation and color saturation for a show released in 2022, there is nothing really bad about this series.It has well rounded characters with each person having their own purpose in the bigger picture.A somewhat abrupt ending but still worth the entertaining watch.I'd say the music choice and sound effects are pretty...poor, but the story really didn't require it lacking peak action and all.I do commend the story's plot, purpose and pace though, I could go far as to say it was a masterpiece but the ending just doesn't tie up for the entire story.The whole story really just defines how greedy each human really is with the crew members having their own goals for being on a mission to a new haven for humanity. poor, but the story really didn't require it lacking peak action and all.I do commend the story's plot, purpose and pace though, I could go far as to say it was a masterpiece but the ending just doesn't tie up for the entire story.The whole story really just defines how greedy each human really is with the crew members having their own goals for being on a mission to a new haven for humanity."", 'It was something like this.Me: ""Ah, another Netlfix CGI monstrosity.""Exception credits on screen: (original design by Yoshitaka Amano)""Oh, OK then.

She recalls the night before, she had a bit too much to drink and brought Dino home with her. Thus begins the definitive greatest slice of life anime of the decade, maybe even of the last two decades.This anime deserves a 10/10, and for good...reason. I have a soft spot for cute anime girls, and Kaede is simply the cutest gyaru girl, a real qt3.14, but her cuteness can't hold a candle to Dino. Dino is simultaneously best girl and best boy. If Dino is not both your waifu and husbando after watching this anime you simply have horrible taste. While Kaede is undeniably cute, Dino is the messiah of anime mascots. With mascots becoming less popular in anime, Dino is here to do his predecessors justice and save the anime mascot meta.For the final section of my review I'd like to discuss my favorite part of the series, the live action. Both Kaede and Dino receive excellent 3d counterparts, and while Kaede is just as adorable as her 2d version, Dino transcends his anime version. Dino is the perfect anime mascot, but Dino's true greatness is only realized in live action. Dino is manifested as a true, real life mascot, he is 3D, he exists, truly there is no greater euphoria in this world than just knowing this fact. We truly are not deserving of our lord and savior Dino. The iconic duo don't stop at just blessing us with their presence on screen, they also bring us to real life locations in Japan, which is an endearing spectacle for a pitiful, hopeless weeb like myself with no hope of ever seeing Japan in person. The live action also does well to bring out the best of this series' sound design, every time Dino moves one of his appendages a light saber SFX is played, when Dino is happy or triumphant the classic MLG airhorn SFX is played, the creators of this show are certainly up to date with modern meme culture.This anime is overall just a joy, full of wholesome moments and well written comedy.

You don\'t just watch this show for the gyaru Kaede, her best friend Yamada and boyfriend Shouta, but for the exhilarating blue Dino, whose expressions can go from being smitten through animated and IRL discoveries to pure ""catastrophes"" of situations that wrecks Dino time and time again, all while eating its favourite food: cup noodles. All of these simple, yet entertaining timeless comical hilarities, you won\'t get it anywhere else other than here.As if I did not know any better that watching Pop Team Epic\'s masterpiece of a whack-ton of various styles of animation would become the norm (and prepare me for another masterpiece in a span of 2 years), Gal and Dino might as well re-affirm my sentiments of the same variations of identifying future Jun Aoki/Kamikaze Douga works, and it\'s still GOAT, no questions asked. But due to COVID (of which you can easily figure out WHICH part got axed), sadly this show joined some other concurrently airing Spring 2020 shows, only to resurface by future seasons. Coming back to the Fall season mid-way was even less of a consolation, because this show also had its audience, but COVID stripped the anime masses away, to the point of ""obsolescence"" with the resulting barren of a wasteland.

Don\'t try to understand it, but experience it for yourself.', 'Never in my life would I have thought I would have to drop an anime. Ever.Here we are, the 25th day of April in 2020. A year surrounded by chaos as Covid-19 runs rampant and we are all locked inside. Well fortunately, that doesn\'t change me much as I will continue to watch anime. The biggest change is me dropping an anime. I have watched and finished far worse anime in my life. I will tell you why I made this decision.So let me focus on some good things before I dig into it. I like the characters. While not amazing, they seem to have...a lot of fun and great personality to go along with it. Lots of energy was put into the characters and I can appreciate that. I think the art style is fun and enjoyable in the animation. We will get to my score later. There were some really wholesome parts with Kaede and dino in the first 4 episodes that I watched which I really enjoyed. The OP is pretty catchy too.Okay, so it had some things going for it, but it definitely had things not going for it (and a lot at that). That is my first complaint. There is literally so much going on. The animation part can be divided into two separate things: the main animation and the ""between scenes"" animation. There is some main story which is actually pretty fun and nice. I enjoy that part. There are some silly intermissions, that while I don\'t particularly love, I can at least watch them with respect. Then the other part of the show is live action. It was a struggled after episode 1 whether I wanted to deem this worthy of an anime title, but I decided to let it slide. The live action parts don\'t really go well together and it just makes me feel like I am legitimately wasting time. The one in Episode 3 I guess was better than the rest by a bit, but still. It didn\'t feel right. I definitely would have had this show be a short instead of adding in what they did. It was like when Cartoon Network started adding in live action stuff. It just didn\'t feel right. Overall, there was just such a variety of substance packed into these 20 minute episodes and it just was a mess.I feel the need to mention my art score. I liked the actual animation quite a bit. I would have given it an 8. It felt fun. I am balancing that with the live action part of 0/10 which gives it a 4. That\'s all. Not that deep.The sounds were really fucking weird. I swear, air horns and lightsabers as sound effects probably aren\'t the best choice. There were a lot of other sounds in there but those were the most notable. Like I said tho, at least the OP bopped.I got most of my complaining out of my system now. I really think dropping this anime may not be for everyone, but I think it is important to talk about and fairly assess the show as is as an anime on an anime site. I just cannot continue to watch and support this abomination of clutter and mess. From what I understand, this is nothing like the manga so far so there is that whole factor too. a lot of fun and great personality to go along with it. Lots of energy was put into the characters and I can appreciate that. I think the art style is fun and enjoyable in the animation. We will get to my score later. There were some really wholesome parts with Kaede and dino in the first 4 episodes that I watched which I really enjoyed. The OP is pretty catchy too.Okay, so it had some things going for it, but it definitely had things not going for it (and a lot at that). That is my first complaint. There is literally so much going on. The animation part can be divided into two separate things: the main animation and the ""between scenes"" animation. There is some main story which is actually pretty fun and nice. I enjoy that part. There are some silly intermissions, that while I don\'t particularly love, I can at least watch them with respect. Then the other part of the show is live action. It was a struggled after episode 1 whether I wanted to deem this worthy of an anime title, but I decided to let it slide. The live action parts don\'t really go well together and it just makes me feel like I am legitimately wasting time. The one in Episode 3 I guess was better than the rest by a bit, but still. It didn\'t feel right. I definitely would have had this show be a short instead of adding in what they did. It was like when Cartoon Network started adding in live action stuff. It just didn\'t feel right. Overall, there was just such a variety of substance packed into these 20 minute episodes and it just was a mess.I feel the need to mention my art score. I liked the actual animation quite a bit. I would have given it an 8. It felt fun. I am balancing that with the live action part of 0/10 which gives it a 4. That\'s all. Not that deep.The sounds were really fucking weird. I swear, air horns and lightsabers as sound effects probably aren\'t the best choice. There were a lot of other sounds in there but those were the most notable. Like I said tho, at least the OP bopped.I got most of my complaining out of my system now. I really think dropping this anime may not be for everyone, but I think it is important to talk about and fairly assess the show as is as an anime on an anime site. I just cannot continue to watch and support this abomination of clutter and mess. From what I understand, this is nothing like the manga so far so there is that whole factor too.', ""Gal to Kyouryuu initially presents itself as a faithful adaptation of its manga counterpart: a series of relaxing animated shorts of a gyaru who met with and took home a dino. With the source material itself being rather short, it receiving a full-length adaptation (as opposed to a 5/10-minute short) is rather curious indeed. And at the halfway point, when the live-action segments begin, and you are greeted with Mieharu-san.The second half of the show is a live-action segment that is incredibly surreal in nature with branching timelines, mysterious tomes, and weird celebrity guest cameos. It's also about a gyaru and her Dino (originally an...old man and his Dino). While occasionally disjointed and strange, this incredibly surreal series still manages to tie into the main themes of the original source material about the relationships of a gal and her Dino, albeit in a very roundabout fashion. Every week I sit in anticipation for the next unpredictable moment of the show, and the Covid-19 pandemic just made the waiting even more unbearable. And at the tail end of it, even if the resolution wasn't what I wanted, I still felt something inside me as Mieharu-san parted with Dino so it could have a better life with Kaede.Not to discredit the animated segments as well. You also get the occasional variety-esque sections with guest animators providing short scenes of the Dino in various (grounded) scenarios that keep the show fresh. And the actual adaptation is fairly well done in it of itself.While it wasn't what I expected, I'm glad to have experienced this one of a kind of show to its end. To say any more would be to spoil its many surprises.

Yes it's not something full of story and doesn't fit your usual anime show, but I think it would be great if people rate and compare it as what it is.

Gal to Kyouryuu, or Gal and Dinosaur, is not one of those anime.”This is how I started my review of Gal and Dinosaur back in April of 2020, however, now I feel that this is too harsh and unnecessarily mean. Now, I didn’t have this sudden realization that Gal and Dinosaur is good, but it is above the 2/10 I was going to give it all...those months ago. Quite a few of my opinions still hold firm, such as the humor and editing are akin to a C-tier modern Cartoon Network show than what many people think of as an anime. My opinions that changed were the story is fine instead of terrible, the art is okay instead of awful, and the music is oaky instead of unbearable. Honestly, I also kind of enjoyed this anime more than I did back in the spring. Really, Gal to Kyouryuu isn’t bad, it’s just not to my taste. 5/10.The story is limited. Really, it’s a slice of life where Gal and Dinosaur are followed around doing whatever. The first half is animated and the second half is live-action, which is largely disconnected from the animated part. These live-action segments are simultaneously funny and cringy. Honestly, I think a silent comedy would work a lot better for this anime, and this might even make the show more enjoyable for me.The sound in the anime is very weird and off-putting. There are random sound effects that sound like lightsabers and airhorns in places where they just don’t belong. Some may say that’s the point. That the whole show is meant to be random and meant to be watched with your brain turned off. Now that’s fine, but it bothers me nonetheless. Moving on from the sounds to the OP and ED, I have to say I kind of like the OP and ED. There have been times when I was at work or a boring lecture at university when one of the songs played in my head, and I would be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy them.The art in the ED is nice, but the art in the OP is just random images with Dinosaur somewhere in them, and I think that is rather lazy and should be stepped up for an OP because this is one of the first things people see going into an episode. Speaking of the first things people see, the sole image of this show on here is terrible. The perspective is all wrong and it looks worse than one of my 12-year-old cousin’s drawings. The art in the show is fine. It doesn’t make me stare in awe like Made In Abyss does, and it doesn’t make me want to go blind like The Seven Deadly Sins: Wrath of the Gods does.The characters are nothing special. They are just stick-puppets that the story flows through. They have bits of personality sure, but a few little bits can’t support all the characters in the story.I kind of enjoyed the whole Gal to Kyouryuu, but it wasn’t good. I don’t hate this show. In order for me to hate this show, it would have to make me slightly worked up. If someone were to tell me that they really liked Gal and Dinosaur I would just shrug my shoulders and say something like “Good for you man, or, I’m glad you like it so much.” When I watch Gal to Kyouryuu I feel like I’m watching a modern Cartoon Network show with my cousins. That being said if you like modern C-tier Cartoon Network shows you will probably like this anime too. In the end, the story gets a 5, art and sound a 4, characters a 5, and enjoyment a 6.

You shouldn\'t watch this anyway.Maybe this is just because I\'m not within the target audience of young adult Japanese females, but this is awful.To start off, the first few minutes of the show are ""OK"". However, all the gags are just about the dinos reaction. It doesn\'t even make a sound. From what I see, the girl taking care of it doesn\'t even seem to care about it. From parading it around and showing it off to friends. To drawing on it, forgetting its even there, stepping on him and choking him. Other than that, its basically...just this girl shopping, talking to some boy and gossiping with friends.Thats honestly it for the anime part. Yeah, you read right. The animation is done. After those first 5 minutes or so, you get a little padding of what can only be called ""stop motion CG"" (as if CG couldn\'t get any lazier) of some other silent gag for another minute or two that does nothing more than show how silly this creature is. Not by doing anything extravagant. Just regular old things with super over the top reactions to every little thing. It sits and watches TV fine. Dinosaur sees moving pictures on a screen? Meh. But waking up on Christmas morning to find a glittering rock wrapped up in a box? HEY EVERYBODY WAKE UP YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS ROCK (said silently only through actions). Totally weird.After that its all live action. Yeah.They got somebody to go out on the streets in a costume that looks like the dino and some admittedly kind of cute girl to walk around talking to what might as well be air. She does a good job trying to be authentic about it at least. I found it kind of amusing how one scene they were outside in the shopping district buying stuff and they actually got a shop owner involved in the scene. Maybe he was just another actor and they paid the stall for a few minutes of filming who knows. Lots of people in the background were clearly giving a few glances at what could possibly be going on. Plenty of them wearing masks too. Not that its strange considering the pandemic, but a little surreal to see in what tries to call itself a comedy.In episode 4 during the live action majority segment, they had some comedian stand there and kind of just... danced? Moved all wacky, shook his beer belly, wore some gag glasses and tried making jokes. In the context of the show it was really embarrassing to watch. However it was hilarious to think somebody actually thought this was a good idea and OK\'d this.Overall it feels like some kind of rejected Disney show. There\'s no real substance or backbone into what is actually going on. And this is from somebody who loves the slice of life genre. It\'s really sad that anime has reached this point and will only get lower.

I\'d like to break all of these down and give my thoughts on each bit.The 2D animated parts are definitely very cute. It does a great job of conveying the simplicity of the manga itself (which I ended up reading to get my fix for the current pause until the next episode), and the color scheme is very attractive to look at. There are only a...few main characters (being our MC Kaede, Dinosaur, and Kaede\'s ex, Shouta), and I personally prefer series with not a whole lot of characters, because my brain will instantly start forgetting them all if I\'m not hooked immediately. There isn\'t much backstory to these characters though, leaving the viewer in the dark about them. The comedy is simple (depending on what you find funny, in this case, a dinosaur just being stupid, which is personally my favorite kind of humor, seeing that I laugh at anything remotely funny), the storyline is simple, and overall, the animated bits are great if you\'re just starting out with anime. I would rate the animated segments a 7.5/10, seeing that they are on the short side with minimal character development, but are very pleasing to the eye.Next, we have the claymation segments. These feature minimal dialogue, and heavily feature the dinosaur doing very mundane things that it is unfamiliar with. I, personally, am very impressed with any kind of stop motion, which is why I enjoyed this part so much. There isn\'t much to say, seeing that these segments are very short, and that they don\'t tie much in with the story. I would give these an 8/10, as the detail put into them is definitely visible.Finally, we have the live action segments, the part that most fans love to hate. I personally love these, and saw them as a huge surprise in the show. Although most of the speaking is from the woman playing Kaede, we have shots of an adorable Dino costume that only makes various airhorn noises. These don\'t tie into the story at all, and are just a cute addition that I personally like. The stories are distinctly different, and play out like a simple slice of life show, combined with you talking to your little cousin that your grandma made you talk to. I don\'t hate these in the slightest, but I can 100% understand where people are coming from when they say, ""I didn\'t like the live action parts since they didn\'t add much and weren\'t great."" Coming from someone who loves the unexpected parts of shows like these, I would personally rate them a 9/10. They\'re unexpected, and are definitely unique to shows like these.Overall, I can understand people being thrown off and deterred by the live action segments and the claymation. They\'re not necessarily ""anime,"" and this is an anime site. If I was to rate this show overall, I\'d give it a solid 8.5/10, but when only focusing on the traditional ""anime"" segment, I believe it does deserve the 7.5/10 I gave it.TL;DR It\'s a beautiful blend of different types of shows, but if it\'s strictly traditional ""anime"" you\'re looking for, it\'s easy to understand if you\'re turned off by its variety. 8.5/10. few main characters (being our MC Kaede, Dinosaur, and Kaede\'s ex, Shouta), and I personally prefer series with not a whole lot of characters, because my brain will instantly start forgetting them all if I\'m not hooked immediately.

I don't understand what people see in this show. Is this for kids? But it's aired at 1am. There is simply nothing this anime does that other anime haven't done better. It brings nothing new to the table. But well... let's see what this anime has to offer.The anime's strong point is certainly the visual style. The 'normal' art style is simplistic but appealing. The character designs are distinct and cute. And of course, there are many different styles incorporated in this show. There are 3D stop motion-esque segments, and...the latter half of each episode is done in a live action style, with a big costume for the dinosaur, which remains expressive with the aid of sound effects and changing the eyes. The transition segments are done by different animators as well, which is pretty neat. The OP and ED also incorporate different media and are a joy to watchBut everything else is mediocre at best. The voice acting is fine, nothing particularly remarkable there. The sound design is bizarre. There are constant random airhorns during the live action segment. I have no idea what that's about. It was entertaining in the first episode due to it taking me off-guard but by the third it just got annoying. The video game-like sound effects for the dinosaur are pretty charming though.The characters themselves, although cute, have their merits end there. Every character is bland. I wouldn't call them unlikeable, just... bland. Forgettable. The titular gyaru is a laid-back nice gyaru. That's about it. The dinosaur acts generally cute. There isn't really anything special about him either. The side characters are even more forgettable. They have no depth. The most depth they get is that there's some mild tension between the gyaru and her ex-boyfriend. There's nothing to be invested in.There isn't a story to this anime, except for a weird subplot that seems to have come straight out of a middle-schooler's fantasy. Just a daily life type of thing. But even then, it's just dull. In the most recent episode I watched, there a shot of water filling up a tub... that lasts over a minute. Barely anything happens. Is this supposed to be ambient? The humour is bland as well. It'll make me snort some air out of my nose every once in a while, I guess. Maybe I'm just too old for this.The reason I started watching this anime is because the title intrigued me. And indeed, when I watched the trailer, I found it hilarious. A gyaru and a dinosaur are polar opposites, after all. But after the entertainment of the concept wears off, you're left with having to sit through twenty minutes of what seems to be just a kids' show. I hold out hope that at the end of the anime, there'll be some incredible twist that bumps up my score a digit or two, that will reward me for sitting through all this. But I don't think anything could make it worth it to stare at this show for the equivalent of four hours. There is nothing special about this show. It overstays its welcome by the second episode. I think I would've enjoyed it much more if each episode had been half the length, at least. The entirety of each episode feels like filler. Don't waste your time on this anime. It's not even entertainingly bad, because it does have its merits.

But I recommend you to just watched the later half of episode 4 and nothing else.Single line review - bat shit and dog waterI watched Gal & Dino when it was airing, just remembered this and skimmed through it again and decided to write a review.This ""anime""... is an experience. The plot sounds interesting enough for something I might watch when I have nothing better but the problem is that the story is too bland. The dino is really cute though I love his actions.The ""anime"" only lasts for some time. It then switches to this clay animation type of thing which...is very boring. Then they come to the live action part which makes absolutely no sense but it\'s not bad I guess. The first episode shows mostly the same story in both anime and live action but gal is replaced by a salaryman?This was a weird and below average show. That was, until they came to episode 4. They decided to go batshit crazy on this thing! The dino turns on the TV and there\'s this dude in his underwear just doing weird dance and ending with that weird ""Aa"" thing (watch it if you dare). Then the dude comes out in real life and does shit you\'d think only a dude higher than the fucking sky would do. It\'s absurd beyond comprehension.Who thought this was a good idea? This is weird asf is very boring. Then they come to the live action part which makes absolutely no sense but it\'s not bad I guess.

It\'s an unholy mix of live action, stop motion, and animation all done horribly wrong. Wondered what a unmemorable 5 minute 4-koma manga translated into a full 12 episode 24 minute production? This is it.This show really puts needlessly long segments of ""stillness"" due to I guess, their lack of budget. It\'s extremely slow paced, and any sort of jokes that could have been funny are destroyed by the terrible pacing. Not to mention, the simplicity of all the gags and...the lack of characters, to say the least, make it so that if the execution of these simple setups are done properly, there\'s nothing else for the viewer to latch onto. The show has simple contents, but if executed well, it goes great. If not, then, there\'s not much to talk about. Unfortunately, the skits and gags are barely passable, and when there\'s nothing else redeeming or focused upon in this show, it becomes real chore to watch.. This is extremely evident in the CG and animation. One minute jokes get turned into 5 minutes worth. And that\'s the episode.Look, I\'m not going to even comment much on the live action portions. I am not familiar with JP live action, because I don\'t like it Ok? However, do trust me when I say that the production value of the live action portions are poor to say the least.This show just puts stuff of pure mediocrity together to mash up 12 episodes of pure nonsense.

Gekiganger 3: The Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2067/Gekiganger_3__The_Movie,"[""Gekiganger 3, a fictional anime within the Martian Successor Nadesico TV series, is a parody/tribute to old 70s Super Robot shows, like Mazinger Z and Getter Robo.Those are all the basics. I liked it, and if you appreciate old-school Super Robot shows, or like to make fun of the formula and its quirks, this is a nice OVA which can be enjoyed without using up too much of your time.Story:The OVA is quite self-contained, so you don't really need to know about Nadesico in order to understand it. A couple of Nadesico characters are going to see the Gekiganger 3 movie, but they...don't really interrupt the action once it begins, which is fair enough. Previous Nadesico knowledge will give you a little bit of extra background info, making it a plus but nothing essential.Before the main feature, a short compilation of episodes from the fictional Gekiganger 3 TV series provides a quick overview of the story so far, what the characters are like and how their world works. Some viewers prefer the compilation to the movie, but I think both work here and, if anything, the movie is a fair representation of what similar projects were like in reality: an excuse to see robots and aliens beat the crap out of each other, without being too concerned about plot holes and continuity issues.The Gekiganger 3 story itself isn't going to win any awards for originality or complexity, but it's not meant to: three passionate young men combine their powers to pilot a giant Super Robot in order to defend the Earth from alien invaders. A timeless formula, whether you take it seriously, like the characters in the show and countless others do, or just want to laugh at the ensuing over the top antics, silly melodrama and mindless hot blooded action. Having a little bit of both perspectives is fine too, of course.Animation:Character and mecha designs are intentionally meant to look dated and aren't very impressive (not to mention original) by modern standards, but they definitely give the OVA a nice classic feel. Production values are decent and the animation, while lacking, is relatively smooth at key moments. It has to be said that tolerating a generous use of stock footage is a must, obviously, especially during robot transformation and attack sequences.Sound:The music, while somewhat repetitive, is quite good for the Super Robot genre, being mostly energetic but also melodramatic or sad when it needs to. The Gekiganger 3 theme song is actually pretty catchy as well, especially if you like older anime openings.Character:Since this is supposed to be a Super Robot parody/tribute, the characters are directly inspired by the heroes, villains and supporting cast members of genre classics like Mazinger Z and Getter Robo, among others. Many of them are fine archetypes of good and evil, their stories being simple and entirely predictable if you've seen any Super Robot shows before, but still fun to watch in action.  Again, you shouldn't expect to see, say, the cast of an ambitious space opera here, and the OVA is far too short to even remotely contemplate it.Enjoyment:The Gekiganger 3 OVA can be pretty enjoyable if you're prepared to see something of this nature and don't expect to see a completely different show. If that's the case, then this is a fairly good parody/tribute to a classic genre.If Super Robot shows seem like a bore and older animation is a pain to watch, then this probably isn't going to change your mind. don't really interrupt the action once it begins, which is fair enough.

They paired up Yorihisa & Takamichi, Eisen & Inori. Without giving away too much, a minor incident happens and the 'pairs' suspect each other for committing the 'crime'. Since they're all friends it's hilarious to watch them squirm in discomfort when confronting the other, particularly Yorihisa & Takamichi because both of them are sooo polite!The shoujo element is really strong here, borderline shounen-ai in...my opinion. Slow-motion sparkly moments for each character, a few blushes here and there, the male characters bonding...(especially Yorihisa & Takamichi) XDI enjoyed this side story very much. Though it has nothing to do with the main story line it's quite entertaining. If you liked the main series you are going to enjoy this as well. my opinion.

Kerokero Chime,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2074/Kerokero_Chime,"['The pastel-colored world of “Kero Kero Chime” is a world of wonder and adventure, teeming with a diverse array of friendly, funny creatures. It is a world where conflict is born only from misunderstandings, and no one is truly evil. Everyone can be forgiven; everyone can become a friend. And no matter what difficult situation you may find yourself in, you can rest assured that the outcome will be A-OK. As long as you don’t think too much.This series is about a boy named Aoi who suddenly gets “cursed” by a “wizard” so that he becomes a frog whenever he comes into contact with water....The “wizard” then tells Aoi to come to his world and look for a girl named Mimori, who he says can turn him back to normal. So Aoi goes to this other world and after a lot of searching, finally comes across Mimori, who is the princess of the Frog People. However, she has no clue how to undo the spell, and so the two set out on a grand adventure across a goofy, exotic world, meeting new friends and getting into trouble along the way, in search of pages of a magic book that may contain the spell to undo the transformation “curse.”The premise of the series holds promise, and did get me invested in the series as I progressed through the episodes, wondering what strange creatures/beings they would come across next, what trouble they would get in, and how they would get out of it. (Because they would always get out of it; this is that kind of show.) More than that, however, I wanted answers to the fundamental questions of the series: why did the “wizard” turn Aoi into a frog? Why did no one seem to know any details about the “war,” even though it happened only 10 years ago? And why did everyone think that the Frog and Snake People were enemies?Saying specifically whether any of these questions were answered or not may go into spoiler territory, so, to make it vague, I will just say that the ending is anticlimactic. They avoid explaining the difficult plot points, take the easy way out and make the whole thing a gag, which is disappointing after all the buildup.Ending aside, what about the rest of the plot? Well, most of the episodes are enjoyable, as long as you don’t question too much. Plot holes and deus ex machinas abound. Sometimes it seems as if the writers are just making things up as they go along. But through each episode, there’s a comforting, peaceful feeling that assures you that everyone will get out of whatever predicament they’re in just fine, and the show never really takes a “dark” turn. “Kero Kero Chime” is comedy- and gag-laden; one of my favorite gags is how the character Makaeru enters the scene on a flying/floating chariot, but his derpy-looking horse is always accompanied by “clip-clop” sound effects. Most of the other main characters tend to have catchphrases or other defining comedic traits: for instance, the crystal ball Shoko and her cousin, Shotaro, often speak in English, which can be annoying at times, but also hilarious. The main “villains” of the story display Team Rocket-levels of incompetence.Character interactions can be frustrating at times, however. Mimori is incredibly naive, to the point where she doesn’t understand basic concepts like “battles” or “dates,” and, of course, this gets her in trouble, and Aoi is often scolding her because of this. Leap apologizes a lot, and also often argues with Shoko, which is supposed to be humorous, but the humor feels forced. If it’s convenient to the plot, characters may act out of character and in ways that defy logic. There are a few unnecessary comments about Mimori’s chest size (she’s 14… there shouldn’t be any comments of that sort at all).As for technical aspects, the animation is fair. Not the greatest, but it gets the job done. The art has a fairy tale-like washed-out pastel look. The character designs are nice. Non-human characters are mostly round and silly-looking.The first OP and ED are decent, though I don’t really care for the “sexy” line while showing Mimori in the OP. The second OP and ED, which are both sung by Mimori’s voice actress, aren’t as good. The second ED, in particular, is almost like a music video, showing live-action shots of the singer, and doesn’t really fit the tone of the series.The best technical parts of this series are the sound effects and background music. Both of these are great, especially the BGMs. They’re memorable and appropriate for each scene.Finally, the voice acting. Most of the characters are voiced by people whose main line of work is not voice acting, and it shows. Others just had bit parts in around half a dozen anime over the years. The people who voice the two main characters, Aoi and Mimori, have the most experience, but Aoi is usually just yelling or spouting off about something, and Mimori’s voice doesn’t have much range, either. Makaeru’s voice almost sounds wooden at times. However, there is one major, major exception to all of this, and that is a relatively minor character who shows up and joins the group towards the end of the series. This character is a pirate captain, and is voiced by none other than the voice of Luffy herself, Mayumi Tanaka! Since this series aired a full two years before One Piece started, perhaps her performance in this role had something to do with her later landing the Luffy role. In any case, we get to hear a proto-Luffy of sorts in the last 5 episodes of the series, which is a treat.Overall, this show could be considered a palate cleanser. If you’ve watched something dark and/or depressing, or a psychological show that made you think so hard that your brain needs a break, relax and give “Kero Kero Chime” a try. It’s far from perfect, but who needs perfection when you have a happy, colorful adventure, surrounded by happy, colorful friends in a happy, colorful world?

Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34497/Death_March_kara_Hajimaru_Isekai_Kyousoukyoku,"[""Death March is an isekai series similar to One Punch Man. It focuses around an overpowered mr. nice guy Jesus named Satou who saves women from slavery among other things with the powers of an I.T. guru, and makes them his property.The events include mr. nice guy raping and pillaging like a viking, except he does the polar opposite because he is nice. Other characters in this series are women. Slave girls 1-7 and a knight. Most of them are very much into mr. nice guy but he himself is a nice guy who doesn't use women. We shan't never know what type of a...glopping sound this guy makes.What about the most common quality trait in anime: character development? Satou is already perfect so naturally, he isn't developed, but our main girls and side chicks all like Satou more at the end than in the beginning =  character development. The best part is how much this makes sense, after all, there is no reason to not like the guy.The art and sounds follow the average production values which have been the standard for anime since 2013. Nothing to complain there. Just name your favorite hair color and there is a girl who has it. Smart choices.When it comes to enjoyment, I haven't had this much fun with something that is close to unwatchable since Shingeki no kyoujin S01 aired. I highly recommend this show because it never tried to be anything, and thus didn't fail at it. glopping sound this guy makes.What about the most common quality trait in anime: character development?

I highly recommend this show because it never tried to be anything, and thus didn't fail at it."", ""Death March is one of the most innovative anime that I’ve seen in awhile.Now wait a second, I’m being completely serious here. I’m not trying to coerce you into reading my review by starting off with a lame sarcastic statement. Just bear with me for a bit. Now Death March has a typical isekai plot that is generic in every sense of the word. The visuals and soundtrack are plain, and the protagonist is yet another incomprehensibly dull Kirito knockoff.  But this anime is truly unique in that out of the entire lead female cast, none of them have BIG BOOBS. That’s right, all...of the important girls in this show either have modest chests or are lolis. Now I don’t know about you, but I’ve seen a plethora of harem/eiichi/isekai/anime with a bunch of girls in them, and these shows always showcase at least one main female character with large breasts who usually ends up at the butt of at least one boob joke. Not Death March. I was honestly in shock when I discovered this, and I can say without a doubt that the lack of boobs is incredibly original for this type of anime. So if you’re an avid supporter of voluptuous breast, then you’d best find something else to watch. However, if you just so happen to be a lolicon, then you might actually enjoy this anime.Of course, that's only if you found anything else about Death March to be good, which I unfortunately didn’t.I really didn’t want to dislike this anime. I actually don’t go into isekai anime and think, “Ugh, I just know I’m going to hate this because its unoriginal. I’m definitely going to give it a low score!” before I even watch the show. However, Death March unfortunately ended up being not only generic, but poorly executed as well. One of the biggest issues that I have with this anime is the fact that it doesn’t go anywhere. As far as I can tell, there are no goals or objectives that the main character is trying to achieve, and all Death March does is showcase this dude living in a fantasy town with his loli slaves and occasionally fighting weak monsters whenever they appear. And even the enemies who are built up to be potent forces are completely owned by the protagonist, thus completely removing any sense of excitement or tension in these actions sequences, resulting in some unbelievably dull moments.Now before I continue to discuss the failings with the general plot execution and story elements of Death March, I’d first like to address what I found to be the most monumental error of the anime, which would be the main character.Our protagonist is named Kazuto Kirigaya Knockoff, or KKK for short, and he is a dude who inexplicably gets transported to a fantasy world after falling asleep at work. Wow, Death March didn’t even come up with any reason at all, much less a tangible one, as to why this guy got teleported to this world. Anyway, KKK is, wait for it…completely overpowered from the get-go! How exciting! This guy can literally just max out any ability instantly whenever he feels like it and seems to be invulnerable to everything. Because why would anyone want to watch a character work hard to get strong when you can just start off invincible like KKK? But he’s too modest to show off his immense power, so he usually lets others fight and die during battles while he puts in minimal effort. How heroic! He also purchased all but one of the main girls as slaves but decides not to free them because in his opinion, they’re all happy as slaves because he’s a good master. How noble! Finally, KKK’s personality is, from what I could discern, nonexistent. Seriously, his mediocrity as a character is astounding.None of the female characters receive substantial development and only succeed at looking cute. If written correctly, I believe that several of these characters had the opportunity to be interesting, but their lack of growth decimated the chances of this actually happening. Let’s start off by analyzing Tama, Pochi, and Liza. The anime mentions how this trio is discriminated against by the general populous for being animal girls. Now the anime could have delved into illuminating the deleterious effects that this torment had on the mentality of these girls and their outlooks on society, but of course it doesn’t. The girls’ only character traits are that they’re nice and like to eat a lot. At least the latter ties into the fact that the girls were malnourished under their previous master. The majority of the other girls in the anime receive similar treatment from the writers, which is unfortunate.The girl who stood out to me the most was Arisa, whose gimmicks were kind of cute and amusing, however the comedic value of her actions, such as her sexual advancements towards KKK, were lessened due to KKK’s lack of reaction towards them. In order for comedy between two individuals to truly shine, both of them have to play their part. So although Arisa’s flirtatious behavior was fun, since KKK didn’t actually respond to it in any way, the scenes between them lost value in my eyes. Leave it to KKK to suck the joy out of everything.I believe I mentioned how the slave girls love food. Well, apparently the show’s creator does as well, to the point where he decided it would be a fantastic idea to insert a plethora of random showcases of a variety of exquisite dishes into the show. What basically happens is that whenever KKK sits down to eat a meal, he goes off on an unnecessary explanation of the food’s properties while the anime presents viewers with an image of the food that is more intricately animated than anything else in the anime. And this happens in literally every episode. Its like I’m watching a cringy, mediocre version of Shokugeki no Soma, except this anime is supposed to be about a fantasy world, not food, so these scenes that last several minutes are completely worthless. Plus, I thought that this was a medieval setting, so where the heck did all of these exotic dishes from across the globe come from? Shouldn’t they just be eating hard bread or something? I had to dedicate a paragraph to this because it just seems so absurd and out of place to me for an anime that isn’t about food at all to dedicate so much time to characters eating.Well, it seems like I ran out of things to talk about. I know I said earlier in this review that I would eventually get to discussing the plot elements of the show and why they fail, but between you and me, that was just an excuse for me to move on and talk about something else. The truth is, Death March’s so called “plot elements” are basically nonexistent, so there’s practically nothing to actually discuss. This show is simply about a guy living in a fantasy world going about his day to day life with his loli slaves. Nothing noteworthy happens, and there is zero development in the story and characters. I have to give some credit to the show though, because although it was terribly boring to watch, for some reason I stuck with it, so I guess that’s something. Maybe I was just waiting to see if KKK would eventually develop an actual personality and stop being a horribly boring and annoying character.…It never happened.Oh well. I honestly couldn’t find anything that appealed to me in this anime, but I’m sure there are some isekai fans out there who enjoyed it. Maybe even you. Now that this chapter in the great bibliography of isekai anime has concluded, its time to set our sights to the future of the genre. Hopefully upcoming installations will tell a more compelling tale than Death March. of the important girls in this show either have modest chests or are lolis. Now I don’t know about you, but I’ve seen a plethora of harem/eiichi/isekai/anime with a bunch of girls in them, and these shows always showcase at least one main female character with large breasts who usually ends up at the butt of at least one boob joke. Not Death March. I was honestly in shock when I discovered this, and I can say without a doubt that the lack of boobs is incredibly original for this type of anime. So if you’re an avid supporter of voluptuous breast, then you’d best find something else to watch. However, if you just so happen to be a lolicon, then you might actually enjoy this anime.Of course, that's only if you found anything else about Death March to be good, which I unfortunately didn’t.I really didn’t want to dislike this anime. I actually don’t go into isekai anime and think, “Ugh, I just know I’m going to hate this because its unoriginal. I’m definitely going to give it a low score!” before I even watch the show. However, Death March unfortunately ended up being not only generic, but poorly executed as well. One of the biggest issues that I have with this anime is the fact that it doesn’t go anywhere. As far as I can tell, there are no goals or objectives that the main character is trying to achieve, and all Death March does is showcase this dude living in a fantasy town with his loli slaves and occasionally fighting weak monsters whenever they appear. And even the enemies who are built up to be potent forces are completely owned by the protagonist, thus completely removing any sense of excitement or tension in these actions sequences, resulting in some unbelievably dull moments.Now before I continue to discuss the failings with the general plot execution and story elements of Death March, I’d first like to address what I found to be the most monumental error of the anime, which would be the main character.Our protagonist is named Kazuto Kirigaya Knockoff, or KKK for short, and he is a dude who inexplicably gets transported to a fantasy world after falling asleep at work.

When I sat down and decided to give this series a try, it felt like an anime that I would not have high expectations on. The premise, character visuals, and just overall idea of it sounds like a copy-paste story you can find in almost any light novel medium these days. But for Death March, this proved to be one of the blandest anime...I’ve seen in recent years even compared to similar premises. It’s a literal slap to the face to anyone who expect this to be better than what it looks like.Just for reference, I have read the light novel and keeping it up with took a lot of commitment. I’m actually close to dropping the LN series but this adaptation is on another level of trash. Taking place in a fantasy setting with RPG gimmicks, we got main protagonist Ichiro Suzuki (also known as “Satou” in the other world). His life changes one day after getting hit into an accident and wakes up in this unknown world. Sound familiar? I swear, you can literally pick up any light novel these days with a similar premise and the set up would be something similar. In the meantime, we follow Satou’s adventure as he begins to adapt with his new life.I’m just going to throw it out here. This show is extremely blend in terms of storytelling. My initial impression of the first few episodes were pretty much me struggling to stay awake. Not only is Satou an uninteresting protagonist but the story itself is devoid of emotions. It’s actually a bit ironic since a show like this should have colorful world fiction to make the setting feel alive. What do we get instead? A group of one dimensional characters in a blend world that felt like it’s part of a video game.  Or I should say, a broken video game. A polished game would have memorable characters but you’ll find none of that in this series. Main protagonist Satou is not only just overpowered but also exhibits some disturbing personality if you read between the lines. The way he speaks, behaves, and interacts with certain characters is never engaging to watch. It doesn’t help that his personality is dry to the bone and seemingly always acts the same with his harem. Oh, I did just say that word. Some people may not call this a harem but to me, this series is about as harem-esque as it can get. Consisting of mainly female characters, it doesn’t take long for viewers to find out that they are fond of Satou. Arisa, Pochi, Tama, Zena, Nana. There’s pretty much no character development for any of the main cast. Instead, most of them are there to interact with Satou in order to put him over. The only way to say there’s any development is Satou’s progress as a character as he acquires more skills. Bleh.That being said, I guess there’s some hope for the main story? The series does take place in a fantasy world and that can have potential, right? Wrong. The world building in the series is incredibly underwhelming as most places look bare and feel almost identical. If you’ve seen one place, it feels like you’ve seen them all. Bear in mind that as the series progresses, the world of Death March never evolves just like the weak character cast. The story feels more like a slice of life with occasional fighting and drama thrown in. My main issue in the story is just how meekly it’s written. Story segments feel anticlimactic and lacks substance. It doesn’t connect with the characters and never makes an impact. Pacing issues also puts this show to shame from the start as it never manages to salvage itself. Also, keep in mind that the light novel series has hundreds of chapters and this is a 12-episode anime adaptation. Yes, you can guess it. This anime pretty much throws the big fat sign of “buy the light novel!” My advice is don’t. That money could be put into so much more value and it’s a waste to spend it on this. Nonetheless, Death March loves to showcase Satou like he’s some of saint in the show. And that gives me nothing more than a thumb down.Silver Link adapts this anime and it’s sad to say but they dropped the ball. What could have been a beautiful world setting turned into mediocre junk. I’ll be honest here. It’s terrible. The CG is awkward along with the blend character designs. Even the main female protagonists all look like cheap cartoons made by amateurs. Most of them have the same face but with different color hair and body proportions. The fan service has incredibly cringe timings that I can’t help but laugh in the wrong way. Action in the series is also poorly animated in terms of choreography and key animation. The body movements feels flat and it seems to me that this anime project was not taken seriously from the beginning.I’m not usually one to jump on a character for their voice but my goodness, Satou’s voice genuinely makes me wish they found a better VA. His voice sounds like it’s putting us to sleep and lacks any personality. Even when he shows emotions, it feels incredibly forced with cheesy dialogue delivery. There’s not one line in this show that I find memorable and that’s because of his voice mannerisms. Sometimes, I wish there’s a volume lower than mute. The theme songs aren’t much better as it’s incredibly generic made with lazy lyrics.Watching Death March was a challenge for me. What could have been a chance to showcase a watchable fantasy series turned into an abomination. By the time I finished watching this show, I felt a sigh of relief that the series ended up only receiving 12 episodes.  It should have just been left alone as a light novel instead. The adaptation has a dysfunctional story, uncharismatic character cast, and really gives isekai a bad name. In fact, I’d say Death March almost made a show like Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni look good. I’ve seen in recent years even compared to similar premises.

The adaptation has a dysfunctional story, uncharismatic character cast, and really gives isekai a bad name. In fact, I’d say Death March almost made a show like Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni look good.', 'Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody seems almost as perfunctory as anime gets, as if to be the self-appointed embodiment of “anime today, 2018” . By that same token, it manages to actually somewhat succeed at being incredibly basic and even generic (temporarily), because sadly, it\'s hard to find a show that can pull this off. Giving the finger to SAO, Re:Zero, and Isekai wa Smartphone, this is Death March’s brief time in the limelight.I\'m sure that at least some who are aware of my outlook on a variety of shows of Death  March\'s ilk are recognizing me as daft for even...glancing at this show\'s general direction. However, the intention goes far beyond having an excuse to malign another anime. Put it simply, I want to prove the existence of a hierarchy.Every genre, and every category of entertainment has a relative and not entirely subjective hierarchy consisting of installments that are better than most, worse than the rest, or are somewhere within a grey area of sorts. Even the harem show has undisputedly better installments such as Ouran High School Host Club, and irrefutably awful ones as well, such as Isekai wa Smartphone. The school battle anime typically goes with the comparison of Chivalry of a Failed Knight to The Asterisk War for such a comparison. While some shows that are more commonly considered to be in the middle are treated like the worst of their kind, it wouldn\'t be fair to label them as such. Even genericism can be executed swimmingly or horrifyingly. When standards get low enough, competence can become startling. As for where this show stands in the isekai totem pole...well, an important enemy from episode 1 somehow died offscreen in the beginning of episode 2; this anime isn\'t exactly the savior anyone here is asking for.Slamming aside, this show isn’t half bad. In fact at times it can be decent, even good. For example, the first 12 minutes are actually pretty great. We were shown a horrifyingly real depiction of the Japanese work industries, with people often staying for hours upon hours at their job, falling asleep there out of sheer exhaustion, not coming home for days at a time, and the workload being asinine. The directing by Shin Onima helps sell how dreary it all is, with incredibly harsh lights shining when the protagonist sits on a train to get to work in his sleepy state, and how silent everything is in the workplace in regards to background music until we transition into the primary setting of this anime. Hell, even when the surprisingly likable MC is transported to said game world setting (don\'t ask me how, this never makes sense no matter which anime pulls it, and most don\'t even explain themselves in some way), it still feels oppressive. When he first enters the game, we get to see Sato immediately become at least somewhat disillusioned with the idea of this being an ideal “dream” when he is attacked and writing with pain while bleeding, in a scene somewhat reminiscent of some of the better moments of Re:Zero’s early portions.From there, it becomes a bit more hit and miss. While some aspects of the game make no sense (why would you need allow your character to learn language comprehension?), they did think about stuff like currency, tax, and the overall economics and societal rules in a simple and effective manner, unlike the convoluted and meaningless currency in say, Smartphone, that never gets brought up after the first instance. It somehow manages to be a pleasant watch at times, notably because of the main character, the constant music that blends in perfectly, and the occasionally pleasant misadventures Satou and his posse go through, and the surprisingly passable world-building. Sometimes, the show can feel dull and blasé, needlessly so. It doesn\'t help that the show does sink into some of the more loathsome temptations of its maligned brethren on occasion. It’s annoying to see such practices continue since we’ve come so used to the absolute bottom-tier dreck these kinds of anime shit out souleslly while removing anything they seemingly had in their LN counterpart (see Mahouka’s main character as a known example of this). It does this further as it goes along too, as if the reviled temptation is increasingly difficult for them to resist. Due to this, the bare minimum of what should be considered acceptable can almost be seen as nigh-revolutionary. This really is like the “triple-A game industry”.A large part of why this series works is Satou, our main character. On the surface, he seems like the run-of-the-mill insert, especially based on his appearance. Admittedly his reactions would be rather typical. However, he certainly isn\'t an awkward buffoon who only has a spine when the chips are down like most of his contemporaries are. Plus, a majority of the time, we actually see what he thinks about any given situation. It\'s actually rather amusing to hear him gush over every intricacy of his meals or react negatively to whatever bullshit someone gives him. Additionally, the main character often has to use his surroundings to adapt to new situations (with ease, but still, it\'s something) using strategies he comes up with on the fly with party members. The fact that we get to see actual strategies being employed when facing an enemy in say, a dungeon, is surprisingly not that common in MMORPG anime, if Sword Art Online has taught us anything. Him looking like Kirito in the early episodes of his show and being better at MMORPG culture and strategy than him makes him all the more glorious, especially when unlike nearly every other overpowered protagonist, he actually has a semblance of variety to his powers. To add on to how much of a cheeky fuck he is, when he wants to rename a female companion, he just translates their garbage name in Japanese, expecting no one to notice. The only real issue I have with him is that he doesn’t bother leveling up his skills until the need for a specific skill becomes relevant for the first time. One could say it’s so that he doesn’t become boring and absurdly overpowered, but if he can do this already, and if he is already at level 310 by the end of the first episode when by the time we are ⅔ into the series, the highest leveled opponent has been level 50, then this excuse can no longer fly. That, and how he can get dull over time, though not by too much.The main character can\'t carry such an annoyingly dull cast, however, as most of his posse feel less like dynamic characters, and more like largely distinct accessories for him. Obviously he doesn\'t feel this way about them, but as established, he’s certainly less of an audience surrogate than many of his ilk. They\'re thankfully nowhere near as obnoxious as most female harem rosters such as Akashic Records or The Asterisk War, as none of them quite fit into the tired archetypes of harem characters. Additionally, each character is distinct from one another, unlike say, Smartphone. Not to mention that while not every female Satou collects is in love with him, it increases every so often, threatening to turn this pseudo-harem into an actual harem with leftovers. Arisa can get grating sometimes with her bullshit, making her probably the worst of the lukewarm bunch (aside from that one demon in episodes 3 and 4, whose voice was a spell meant to poison the ears), side-characters included. A majority of the villains are borderline worthless husks meant to serve as a “standard evil prick”. Understandably this takes place in a video game but the antagonists really are just the Light Novel adaptation standard when they didn\'t entirely have to be. At least the villain in the second arc has some pretty decent and interestingly foreshadowed motivations.Easily the worst part, however, would be the production values. Even outside of the nice directing moments present in episode 1, and how they purposely instead sunlight saturation in certain moments of episode 2 to accentuate the wonder Satou feels about this new world he is in, there isn\'t much flare to speak of. The character designs look rather sharp, possibly too sharp, though improved over the original novel. Thankfully it isn\'t the LN standard but it\'s still not that pretty to look at. The action is not very well animated either. The magic spells cast have no flash or sense of spectacle like in Konosuba or Knight’s & Magic. As mentioned earlier, there are some neat directing moments sprinkled throughout, but that’s all they are: moments. Not all episodes even have those brief moments, and coupled together with terrible, sometimes even laughable action sequences, it’s certainly little better than the rest of Death March’s borderline pitiful visual presentation.I\'m more than willing to believe that the 2D aspects were studio Silver Link and that the rest is Connect, given their repertoire and how Connect has never done a solo project. I say this because the CGI bears massive similarities to another joint project of theirs: Chaos Dragon. Thankfully there is no frame rate slow-down, aside from the CGI already having bad frame rates as is, but the CGI is both disturbingly prevalent and disconcertingly awful, with most soldiers being reduced to CGI armor models that look putrid, and many creatures being reduced to unintentional abominations due to the same hideous 3D model quality. Regardless, this show looks terrible and doesn’t move well. It’s a shame that somehow it’s the production values that hold a light novel anime back more than anything else, as if this anime wasn’t a bewildering rarity already.The music is mixed as well, though it is conversely the best aspect of the show. The Opening, ""Slide Ride” by Run Girls, Run!, is a damn good contender for “most generic-sounding anime OP”, and needless to say, it wasn’t very pleasing to listen to. The Ending theme, ""Suki no Skill” by Wake Up, Girls! isn’t much better, as it’s another ending theme that isn’t noteworthy. The rest of the music is pretty decent, actually feeling like decent video game music for once. This only applies when the characters are in the villages and not elsewhere. One minor jingle in particular even opts to make you feel like you\'ve discovered or done something grand, and if there’s one thing video game scores are fantastic at, it\'s giving off a sense of grandeur. The track pool even expands in the second half when things try to get more serious and full of dread and tension. There are some nice emotional tracks too, further making it a shame that the opening and ending themes that sandwich these tracks hold everything back.Even in this series\' perfunctory existence, Death march manages to carve out a surprisingly rare niche among its contemporaries. Unfortunately, this speaks to the banality of this type of show more so than the quality of the show itself. A lot of the “compliments” I gave it would be overlooked in most other shows given how basic they are for even most bad shows to accomplish. There are some genuinely nice moments here, visually, and emotionally, so to see the show succumb to temptation is aggravating. At the very least, if something like Isekai wa Smartphone was up your alley, this is worth viewing too, that way you find an infinitely superior product with a trick or two up its nonexistent sleeves. For now at least, I can say Death March thankfully didn\'t live up to its title in terms of viewing experience, awful finale notwithstanding, as it’s surprisingly high up on this totem pole. Not bad for a modern LN Isekai title, let alone one considered part of the harem genre. It may not be good, but hey, baby steps.Also, the fact that people are treating this show like an endorsement of slavery is woefully disconcerting; please don\'t do what you tried going with Mahoutsukai no Yome. glancing at this show\'s general direction. However, the intention goes far beyond having an excuse to malign another anime. Put it simply, I want to prove the existence of a hierarchy.Every genre, and every category of entertainment has a relative and not entirely subjective hierarchy consisting of installments that are better than most, worse than the rest, or are somewhere within a grey area of sorts. Even the harem show has undisputedly better installments such as Ouran High School Host Club, and irrefutably awful ones as well, such as Isekai wa Smartphone. The school battle anime typically goes with the comparison of Chivalry of a Failed Knight to The Asterisk War for such a comparison. While some shows that are more commonly considered to be in the middle are treated like the worst of their kind, it wouldn\'t be fair to label them as such. Even genericism can be executed swimmingly or horrifyingly. When standards get low enough, competence can become startling. As for where this show stands in the isekai totem pole...well, an important enemy from episode 1 somehow died offscreen in the beginning of episode 2; this anime isn\'t exactly the savior anyone here is asking for.Slamming aside, this show isn’t half bad. In fact at times it can be decent, even good. For example, the first 12 minutes are actually pretty great. We were shown a horrifyingly real depiction of the Japanese work industries, with people often staying for hours upon hours at their job, falling asleep there out of sheer exhaustion, not coming home for days at a time, and the workload being asinine. The directing by Shin Onima helps sell how dreary it all is, with incredibly harsh lights shining when the protagonist sits on a train to get to work in his sleepy state, and how silent everything is in the workplace in regards to background music until we transition into the primary setting of this anime. Hell, even when the surprisingly likable MC is transported to said game world setting (don\'t ask me how, this never makes sense no matter which anime pulls it, and most don\'t even explain themselves in some way), it still feels oppressive. When he first enters the game, we get to see Sato immediately become at least somewhat disillusioned with the idea of this being an ideal “dream” when he is attacked and writing with pain while bleeding, in a scene somewhat reminiscent of some of the better moments of Re:Zero’s early portions.From there, it becomes a bit more hit and miss. While some aspects of the game make no sense (why would you need allow your character to learn language comprehension?), they did think about stuff like currency, tax, and the overall economics and societal rules in a simple and effective manner, unlike the convoluted and meaningless currency in say, Smartphone, that never gets brought up after the first instance. It somehow manages to be a pleasant watch at times, notably because of the main character, the constant music that blends in perfectly, and the occasionally pleasant misadventures Satou and his posse go through, and the surprisingly passable world-building. Sometimes, the show can feel dull and blasé, needlessly so. It doesn\'t help that the show does sink into some of the more loathsome temptations of its maligned brethren on occasion. It’s annoying to see such practices continue since we’ve come so used to the absolute bottom-tier dreck these kinds of anime shit out souleslly while removing anything they seemingly had in their LN counterpart (see Mahouka’s main character as a known example of this). It does this further as it goes along too, as if the reviled temptation is increasingly difficult for them to resist. Due to this, the bare minimum of what should be considered acceptable can almost be seen as nigh-revolutionary. This really is like the “triple-A game industry”.A large part of why this series works is Satou, our main character. On the surface, he seems like the run-of-the-mill insert, especially based on his appearance. Admittedly his reactions would be rather typical. However, he certainly isn\'t an awkward buffoon who only has a spine when the chips are down like most of his contemporaries are. Plus, a majority of the time, we actually see what he thinks about any given situation. It\'s actually rather amusing to hear him gush over every intricacy of his meals or react negatively to whatever bullshit someone gives him. Additionally, the main character often has to use his surroundings to adapt to new situations (with ease, but still, it\'s something) using strategies he comes up with on the fly with party members. The fact that we get to see actual strategies being employed when facing an enemy in say, a dungeon, is surprisingly not that common in MMORPG anime, if Sword Art Online has taught us anything. Him looking like Kirito in the early episodes of his show and being better at MMORPG culture and strategy than him makes him all the more glorious, especially when unlike nearly every other overpowered protagonist, he actually has a semblance of variety to his powers. To add on to how much of a cheeky fuck he is, when he wants to rename a female companion, he just translates their garbage name in Japanese, expecting no one to notice. The only real issue I have with him is that he doesn’t bother leveling up his skills until the need for a specific skill becomes relevant for the first time. One could say it’s so that he doesn’t become boring and absurdly overpowered, but if he can do this already, and if he is already at level 310 by the end of the first episode when by the time we are ⅔ into the series, the highest leveled opponent has been level 50, then this excuse can no longer fly. That, and how he can get dull over time, though not by too much.The main character can\'t carry such an annoyingly dull cast, however, as most of his posse feel less like dynamic characters, and more like largely distinct accessories for him. Obviously he doesn\'t feel this way about them, but as established, he’s certainly less of an audience surrogate than many of his ilk. They\'re thankfully nowhere near as obnoxious as most female harem rosters such as Akashic Records or The Asterisk War, as none of them quite fit into the tired archetypes of harem characters. Additionally, each character is distinct from one another, unlike say, Smartphone. Not to mention that while not every female Satou collects is in love with him, it increases every so often, threatening to turn this pseudo-harem into an actual harem with leftovers. Arisa can get grating sometimes with her bullshit, making her probably the worst of the lukewarm bunch (aside from that one demon in episodes 3 and 4, whose voice was a spell meant to poison the ears), side-characters included. A majority of the villains are borderline worthless husks meant to serve as a “standard evil prick”. Understandably this takes place in a video game but the antagonists really are just the Light Novel adaptation standard when they didn\'t entirely have to be. At least the villain in the second arc has some pretty decent and interestingly foreshadowed motivations.Easily the worst part, however, would be the production values. Even outside of the nice directing moments present in episode 1, and how they purposely instead sunlight saturation in certain moments of episode 2 to accentuate the wonder Satou feels about this new world he is in, there isn\'t much flare to speak of. The character designs look rather sharp, possibly too sharp, though improved over the original novel. Thankfully it isn\'t the LN standard but it\'s still not that pretty to look at. The action is not very well animated either. The magic spells cast have no flash or sense of spectacle like in Konosuba or Knight’s & Magic. As mentioned earlier, there are some neat directing moments sprinkled throughout, but that’s all they are: moments. Not all episodes even have those brief moments, and coupled together with terrible, sometimes even laughable action sequences, it’s certainly little better than the rest of Death March’s borderline pitiful visual presentation.I\'m more than willing to believe that the 2D aspects were studio Silver Link and that the rest is Connect, given their repertoire and how Connect has never done a solo project.

The greater one's power, the more options one has at one's disposal; choosing the path that benefits the greatest possible number is the noblest path when many alternatives are available, especially paths focused purely on oneself. Satou is someone who takes the high road and never strays from it.(This review is being written in response to a flood of negative reviews that completely misrepresent Death March. I am so displeased by the rating that I set up a MAL account just to write this.)When we acknowledge that the isekai genre...has been saturated, to say the least, we need to look for differentiating factors. A key point of differentiation is the viewpoint from which the protagonist approaches the new world to which he has been spirited away. The majority of isekais take a youthful and user-centric lens: a gamer teen or a teen / young adult hikikomori. The viewpoints inherent in such a background are limited by the age and by the mindset that said protagonists bring to their worlds. Satou comes to his new world as a builder (one of the lead programmers) and as a working adult - Death March is an isekai where the Game Master is the protagonist.Many isekais are focused on the leveling up aspect (I have fond memories of playing games like Legend of Mir 3 and grinding away). However, what if you accidentally started out at level 310? Death March shows Satou being the coach to his party, so to speak. It's one thing to be an edgy teen trying to perfect your levels, fighting to achieve top dog status; it's a completely different story to already be on the top of the dominance hierarchy and to instead nurture the growth of others. I was a swimming instructor in high school and predominantly had a lot of female students aged 4 to 12 - watching Satou nurture his crew is the embodiment of what it means to be a teacher. Giving them room to experiment, being ever-present to back them up, and always being ready to teach through example - Satou is a man, not a boy. If you cannot relate to the MC, reflect on that.I picked up this anime last week when 3 episodes were available and the moment I was hooked was when it finally entered RPG mode and Satou started being a team leader. Thereafter I binged the entirety of the available manga and am now the proud owner of the 4 available light novels with the 5th pre-ordered.I want to close this review by mentioning the unique focus Death March places on imbuing RPG dynamics continually throughout the narrative. There are isekais that will skew towards the fantasy element, leaving the RPG elements as a backdrop; in Death March, the game elements play a central role in how Satou interfaces with the world. Death March is very precise on roles, skills, title acquisitions, the continual use of the menu etc - a detail to be appreciated by gamers and devs. As someone who has been working in tech, I can appreciate the mindset that Satou brings to acquiring new skills. This is truly a dev's mind on display - we are always reminded that this is a technologist with a Game Master interface, interacting with a fantasy-like environment.In my mind, this is a solid 8/10 anime for the new perspective that it brings to the isekai genre. Don't come here for depth; don't come here for romance. Watch Death March if you want to see how level grinding, skill development, and team development look like from a coach's perspective. Watch Death March if you want to a explore the [builder] mindset, rather than the [user] mindset.

I'd recommend it to people who are fans of 'harem' & 'ecchi', but as a 'shonen'/'adventure' story it's very poor. Nothing you (probably) haven't seen many times before. Most of the show is the MC talking to the women in his harem and making them blush (seriously).The main character is your average MC, he does good, he randomly helps people, etc. He's also absurdly OP. He struggles for a second but then levels up over 300 levels (literally), maxes out his skills and gets bottomless amounts of money. So any tension or intrigue of how he will survive is gone.The harem dynamics...are your average harem dynamics: almost every female falls for the main character and blushes in every scene (literally). Also, the lolicon factor is HEAVY in this.There's almost no action, and the action is VERY low budget. So low so that in ep 4 they showed still images of fights with monsters instead of actual animated scenes of the fights. But it simply bored me, and I just want to write this to let people know that, if you don't love harem stories and OP MCs in stories trapped in video games, this probably isn't for you.I think most of us have memorized these type of stories along with their settings, dynamics, etc. But if this sounds fun to you, well, I hope you have fun.At times I see how this show would be endearing for some people, and at the end of ep 5 there was a glimpse that there could be a half-decent plot, but that is overwritten by the disturbingly creepy pedophilic elements. It's one thing to just have kawaii little girl characters as decorations to make jokes, but it's another to have them all be in love with the MC, trying to seduce the MC, kiss  him and then sleeping naked with him in the same bed.

There are a few Isekai animes already out, and even more mangas not yet adapted. Short story Shorter; The plot of most of the Isekai stories can be summarized to ""Guy somehow ends up in another world. The other world is a...fantasy world where anything from tolkien to new inventions will show up.

The script is simply awful.Every character in this show is monotone, but that\'s nothing you shouldn\'t expect from after having read my opinion of the story. Having monotone characters are sometimes a good thing, character progression is only needed for a few characters in most shows and when emphasized it often ruins the quality, but having no character diversity or progression tells me that the script is awful.To summarize all this yet again, this show has no highlights - it might appeal somewhat to some people for what it sets out to be, but the presentation is too bad to be praised. Personally I don\'t like the story very much, the script (The character lines) are edgy and unnatural, the art is low quality (low production cost), the intro, outro, SFX and ""OST""s are low quality (low production cost) and the characters are way too bland and badly animated to make for even an acceptable harem (if you\'re into that).I will however give this show a 2 in overall ranking since I enjoyed some laughs in the animation used for the ants flying into the barrier in ep6.I decided a few weeks ago to watch this to the end just so that I could see how bad it would progress, and I will keep to that decision, but don\'t follow in my footsteps since this is a bad practise and may hurt your future unless you\'re hardened enough. fantasy world where anything from tolkien to new inventions will show up.

Yes, you did not read wrong, this anime is a very simple Slice of Life on a parallel world, nothing more, nothing less. At the start of the anime, you see a little of Satou\'s past life, as a proggramer, to me that was actually very important and fresh, because I always found myself asking: ""what the hell Kazuma or Subaru did on their past lives"". It\'s just something...that won\'t matter anyway to the main plot of most isekai anime, but it\'s nice to see more of the character, even tough Satou may be seen as an self-insert character(to me he is, as I\'m also game developer), not everyone can relate easily to him, expecially his logic. I mean, most of you would like to be some kind of overlord on another world, but to Satou and to myself as well, he did the right choice, of hiding his powers and make himself as a simple merchant. Even though he is most probably the stronger person on that world. But what he want is really enjoying a happy life with the girls he took to be their guardians. I mean, they may be his slaves as that world says, but he takes care of all of them, as if they were his child. Unfortunately the only female characters with some sort of relevance or at least a bit developed is Arisa, so I\'ll get to her in a bit. First of, Arisa in the inside is a grown-up woman from japan, as is Satou, so her action do make sense, even though she is in a child\'s body. She also is the character responsible for most perverted moments in this show.Another strong point of this anime, in my opinion, is the Art, the characters and scenery are beatifull, even though the animation lacks a lot, a few episodes had action enough to take the score down, so for the part of illustratring the scenery and characters, silver link did a well done job. The sound is also gorgeous, both OP, ED and the music at the end of episode 10 are magnific, as well as the BGS at overall.You can\'t say I didn\'t enjoy this anime because I really enjoyed it up, it was a very refreshing anime with the ""another world"" theme.In overall, this anime is better appreciated if you like isekais and can get through the first episode, as it makes the anime look like another battle isekai.In summary:Story 5Art 9Sound 9Character 7Enjoyment 10Overall grade: 8 that won\'t matter anyway to the main plot of most isekai anime, but it\'s nice to see more of the character, even tough Satou may be seen as an self-insert character(to me he is, as I\'m also game developer), not everyone can relate easily to him, expecially his logic.

First of, Arisa in the inside is a grown-up woman from japan, as is Satou, so her action do make sense, even though she is in a child\'s body. She also is the character responsible for most perverted moments in this show.Another strong point of this anime, in my opinion, is the Art, the characters and scenery are beatifull, even though the animation lacks a lot, a few episodes had action enough to take the score down, so for the part of illustratring the scenery and characters, silver link did a well done job. The sound is also gorgeous, both OP, ED and the music at the end of episode 10 are magnific, as well as the BGS at overall.You can\'t say I didn\'t enjoy this anime because I really enjoyed it up, it was a very refreshing anime with the ""another world"" theme.In overall, this anime is better appreciated if you like isekais and can get through the first episode, as it makes the anime look like another battle isekai.In summary:Story 5Art 9Sound 9Character 7Enjoyment 10Overall grade: 8', 'In this Anime when it comes down to it, has no real story.But the MC\'s gotta catch\'em all Pedomon!(replace all the Pokémon with little girls that talk about meat and an MC who\'s boring as hell and you get this anime)This anime is really just /Harem/Slice of Life/Fantasy/(with just a tea spoon of Action so its not 100% boring)It comes down to a 29 year old dude is thrown into a world where he has super op abilities and hacks but doesn\'t want to use them.

Almost all reviews for this anime are unironical 8 out of 10's or higher. Whatever, lets get into this review.First of. The story, or lack thereof. There is no overall direction with it. It’s not going anywhere. It’s like the writers just wanted to show off cute girls and halfway through writing realized that they had to give the show some sort of substance. Any drama that is supposed to happen never carries any weight because it’s never built up and whatever villain that appears doesn't have any substantial motive. It is obvious that they're there because the writers have a...checklist that they must complete. The latest villain, some random mage literally tells the main characters exactly where to go. Kidnaps the newest girl that is too be added to the mc’s harem. And then the mc has too work his way up a bunch of floors too finally reach the evil guys’ chamber. That is such a stereotypical damsel in distress type story that i don’t even know what's going on. All they need now is a tower and a dragon.The characters...It’s ok to just have a slice of life story that doesn't go anywhere but if you’re going to do that, focus on the characters. Develop them. In slice of life the characters and how they behave in their daily life is supposed to be what carries the show. Konosuba shined in this very way. This show does not. Zena for example is so boring, bland and she actually has no defining character traits. She's just a polite girl who fell in love with our main because the plot told her too. At least the demihumans bring a little shred of comedy (even if i have seen all these types of jokes before). But that is all they are there for and since the comedy isn’t anything new it gets old after a while. So the show doesn't go a more Konosuba character driven route or a more serious story driven route and as such completely falls apart. Don’t halfass two things, tryhard one.Lastly… the mc. Wow, what a disappointment. I can’t even begin to express how much seeing his character turn into nothing hurt me. He started off strong, you see most anime mc’s are teens. Usually around 15. So when i heard that this guy was going to be in his 30’s i got hyped. I hoped this was going to bring some mature thinking too the show. I thought he, being 30 would have developed some type of character. A personality. Him being loved by a bunch of kids around the age of 15 was certainly going to be interesting. How were they gonna handle that. They didn’t. The mc in this show is painfully bland with no defining personality traits whatsoever and the fact that he's an adult isn’t adressed or ever even touched on. Not explored. In fact as icing on the cake they put him back into his 15 year old body when he gets teleported into the fantasy world. It is as if they wanted too really let the viewers know that this anime wasn’t going to do anything different. Of course he’s your stereotypical, nice guy, emotionless, always smiling, plain, bland, harem mc that you’ve seen before thousands of times if you actually watch anime.Oh and btw, the animation sucks. Don’t even make me touch on the lack luster fight-scenes that more resemble still panning shots (i'm referring too later fight-scenes as the first one in episode 1 actually had actual animation and carried a little weight). Oh and btw, the show started strongly. The mc starts off with nothing in a world that he knows nothing about. He’s low leveled and we actually get to see him struggle and hurt. Legitimate emotions are being brought out here and thats why im so mad that the show then turned into what it turned into. Because it started off really down to earth with the mc pulling all-nighters at his office and then actually struggling in the fantasy world if even only for like 10 minutes of episode 1. But then the mc of course reaches the max level in one fight by literally wiping out an entire army with meteors. Yeah, f’ck this show. checklist that they must complete.

Now you will) and pedo moments. 45% of the time, characters are eating / searching for food or buying some useless things because there’s a need to fill this empty anime, 45% is full of that creepy thing about those 10 years old slaves kids showing their...love to the main character and the 10% left is about random things that happen that our hero resolve by upgrading his skills.It seems like the author had one thing in mind doing this anime : “ Ok, those prepubescent kids are in love with fan-service ? Let’s make an anime where everything is about that ! We’ll put some furry, with animals ears and tails, they will be able to fantasize and masturbate on it ! Make them slaves, that’s more sexual. Let’s give them 10 years old, no personality. Now let’s make them cry every 5 minutes about how they are hungry or how much they love the main character ! That’s perfect.… Damn, but those characters have to do things in this world now, we need a plot… Mhhh... let’s add random events that have nothing in common, btw nobody will care because they will all love that shitty sexual thing around my characters !This anime have two important life lessons for you, the first is, if a woman is mad at you, just buy her stuff (like earrings and shit) . And if you face a problem, just cheat your way out of it (by upgrading your skill at the last second). The philosophical ethics is on point. And don’t forget, if a 11 year girl want to fuck you, it’s ok as long as she’s mentally older!There is no scenario: the plot for the season 1 is non existent, MC is catapulted in this new world and..  do nothing except eating, buying stuff and sheltering every loli he met. The anime try to give us some interest by suggesting the MC is the new hero who will kill the demon king (how original), but because Satoo is OP, nobody can kill him, there is no sense of danger, and therefore no progression possible, and unlike one punch man, the situation is not nearly as funny.CharactersI must admit the cast of characters is really diverse, you have a loli cat girl, a loli dog girl, a loli princess, a loli innkeeper's daughter. In fact Death march must really have a population problem, because 90% of the people are prepubescent girl there. There is only one and i really mean ONE other dude on this anime who have more than 2 line of dialogue (but is a cliché btw), and he literally do nothing significant. It’s like the guy behind the story had some ideas for the plot but after 5 minutes of reflexion, got bored.Sato: your generic kirito dude, he’s overpowered, he’s boring as hell, he have 0 charisma ( special mention to his submissive voice who try to sound calm) and the ladies love him because he is rich and nice.Girl’s harem: In Death March, every girl of the harem are both walking cliché(the shy one, the energetic/happy etc..) and so similar that they don’t even deserve a specific description. They all are half retarded (compared to them the hero seems like a genius), in love with the MC for no reason and zero personalities (well with nearly no backstories behind it must be logical)SoundSatoo’s seiyuu died halfway of the first episode (18:10 you can check by yourself) and was replaced at that point by someone with an oyster charisma (RIP).We will not talk about the flying enemy monster who sounds so comically bad it would be fun if this anime was a parody, unfortunately, it isn’t.The accelerated voice sounds when they throw a spell is fucking weird and hurt my earring.The music is ok, nothing memorable except two at the end of the Tree arc and the ending of ep 10, too bad you will only hear them once.Art/AnimationYour generic fantasy universe mixed with cat girl, dog girl and even lizard girl because why the fuck not? As long as it look like a loli you’re free to go.It’s like dragon ball super and powerpoint had a child, and that child got hit by a truck. Two frame fight, an abuse of fixed plane, blurry effect everywhere. Very weird color choice (the food look so bad, with no texture and wrong colors that it look like someone puked them). The animation is cheap and easy but unlike Mcdonalds, it doesn't feel satisfying to watch. Graphism are comparable to what was produced 10 years agoLight effects are ok tho.Can we talk about Arisa hair color changing every scene for no reason? Or recycling of background whenever it’s possible  (one of the most blatant example is when Satoo is travelling and you see the same house every 2 second)The 3d part feel out of place and is just plain ugly.EnjoymentAfter 5 episode of disturbing child sexualinnuendo, food and nonsense, i fell asleep several times during episode 6. So I rewound to see what I had missed and there was only loli, food, and an ants army that was useless as fuck.The first episodes, it was funny to make fun of the anime, but you know, the shortest jokes are the best.

Hugely popularised by Tenchi Muyou in the previous century it has come a long way for better and for worse. Death March is another of those fantasy cliche harem Isekai with an OP MC not unlike last year\'s infamous Isekai Smartphone. Where was Death March different? Was it better? Is it watchable? Let us see.Starting off strong, Death March started off with a guy named Satou who is a 29 y/o programmer and is transported to a fantasy game where he becomes OP almost immediately. What I liked about the starting was that it...didn\'t jump off straight into the harem action and instead gave a small backstory about the MC. Sadly it was completely washed out by (guess what?) all the harem action that followed and till the end we followed one formula: Problem occurs, Satou learns of it, Satou solves it, Girl gets picked up and attracted to Jesus-kun, next episode. This formula to be honest completely exhausted my interest and dropped the score down to a 6 to which it still stands. The story I\'ve got to say tries to be unique but since it throws all these cliche situations and doesn\'t stop using the same formula repeatedly it falls short of a good score. Frankly I couldn\'t be disappointed more than this. I had expected the story to be way better than Isekai Smartphone but even though it DID improve it didn\'t improve to the point I\'d hoped it would. Does that make it good? No. Simply because it was too lacking in the story dept to amaze me.Death March mixed two things I strongly started to dislike as I watched more anime, Lolis and harems. I was a fan of the latter before but quickly lost interest due to the lack of innovation in the genre. Death March is a perfect example of that, wasted potential. It had bright looking caracters but that\'s all they were. Flat. No personality apart from a few unique features and a hard on attraction towards Jesus-kun for some reason. Now the show does have it\'s good points even though they are few in number. The soundtrack is good and nice to hear and fit the theme perfectly, quite shocking because Death March failed in almost every other aspect. It\'s art was vibrant and all but it\'s few fight scenes let me down and the fight scenes themselves felt short and half-assed. They could have done a much better job with that.Flat Characters, weak story, OP MC. What else is there to note about Death March? Nothing more since that\'s all that this and other modern Isekai anime are about. It\'s hard to come by good Isekai these days simply because the SAO effect is still on going and I can\'t wait for the next decade when hopefully this trend dies out and we get some actual innovation in the anime industry for once. Needless to say I didn\'t find Death March enjoyable and apart from a few minutes was boring to watch. Characters like Arisa had a lot of potential because of their ""could-be-amazing"" story especially since Arisa\'s backstory was quite unique and if explored could do much better but no. They had to focus in Satou\'s oh so powerful skills and the way he picks chicks just HAD to get extra screentime. I won\'t be surprised if we get an OVA and the same goddamn formula is used there as well. Mark my words, this WILL happen. You see if it doesn\'t. That is, if this shovelware even GETS an OVA, which unfortunately looking at Japan\'s taste in OP Characters is all but unapproved of.What could Death March have done better? It could have made the characters more believable and given some personality to them instead of using then as Waifu material which I\'m sure the otaku masses will still gladly feed on without noticing that the characters are a textbook example of how characters SHOULDN\'T be made and that Death March is such a huge tribute to last year\'s Isekai Smartphone. I already got started on that before so I\'ll try not to spew more on Isekai Smartphone. Now since I do my new format reviews, I do not do the scores until after I\'m done writing but I won\'t be surprised if it gets a 5 or way less. Frankly if you force me to be the most conservative person out there I will say this then ""Death March could be considered mediocre since it does most of the things bad but since that\'s how almost all Isekai anime are like this it\'s considered mediocre"" since that\'s unfortunately the case with the anime industry today. Since when were such anime considered mediocre I\'ll never know, but eh, I\'ll have to mark it that way then else it\'d be unfair to other Isekai anime like Isekai Smartphone.Looking for a good Isekai to watch? First off, good and Isekai have never been further apart. Now that statement was an exaggeration if I do say so myself since as with everything in this world there\'s always exceptions. Isekai anime weren\'t always as shit as they look like in this decade and you don\'t need me to tell you that if you are a long time anime watcher. If you ask me a recent Isekai that WAS good I\'d gladly recommend KonoSuba to you not because it\'s just so funny and it ranks third in my favorite comedies but the fact it\'s a refreshing take on the Isekai genre simply because it is a middle finger to the Isekai genre itself. It parodies and takes those Isekai cliches and makes fun of them. Meanwhile another good Isekai you could watch is Isekai Seikishi Monogatari which is a Tenchi Muyou spin-off (the title I mentioned earlier) and is frankly my personal favorite Isekai since it not only has a proper centered plot but it divides the episodes into two parts the first being all the fanservice and the second being all the plot so it helps as everyone gets what they want.Whatever the matter. If you do choose to watch the anime I recommended or instead decide to watch Death March or Isekai Smartphone, keep in mind that this is a genre heavily influenced by the SAO effect and that it doesn\'t look like that effect will hold down soon. Yet there\'s still light at the end of the tunnel. Will we see a good Isekai sometime soon? I sure do hope so. As for now, time to wait for the second season of Isekai Smartphone (groans inside)Overall Rating: 4.2P.S: I rarely do my best girl columns since I made my new format but I\'ll bring it back next time since I didn\'t find anyone in Death March interesting. Maybe Liza was a bit fun to watch in the earlier episodes and Nana was cute but no one interested me much to call them the ""best girl"". So apologies hardcore Otakus. didn\'t jump off straight into the harem action and instead gave a small backstory about the MC.

That is, if this shovelware even GETS an OVA, which unfortunately looking at Japan\'s taste in OP Characters is all but unapproved of.What could Death March have done better? It could have made the characters more believable and given some personality to them instead of using then as Waifu material which I\'m sure the otaku masses will still gladly feed on without noticing that the characters are a textbook example of how characters SHOULDN\'T be made and that Death March is such a huge tribute to last year\'s Isekai Smartphone. I already got started on that before so I\'ll try not to spew more on Isekai Smartphone. Now since I do my new format reviews, I do not do the scores until after I\'m done writing but I won\'t be surprised if it gets a 5 or way less. Frankly if you force me to be the most conservative person out there I will say this then ""Death March could be considered mediocre since it does most of the things bad but since that\'s how almost all Isekai anime are like this it\'s considered mediocre"" since that\'s unfortunately the case with the anime industry today. Since when were such anime considered mediocre I\'ll never know, but eh, I\'ll have to mark it that way then else it\'d be unfair to other Isekai anime like Isekai Smartphone.Looking for a good Isekai to watch? First off, good and Isekai have never been further apart. Now that statement was an exaggeration if I do say so myself since as with everything in this world there\'s always exceptions. Isekai anime weren\'t always as shit as they look like in this decade and you don\'t need me to tell you that if you are a long time anime watcher. If you ask me a recent Isekai that WAS good I\'d gladly recommend KonoSuba to you not because it\'s just so funny and it ranks third in my favorite comedies but the fact it\'s a refreshing take on the Isekai genre simply because it is a middle finger to the Isekai genre itself. It parodies and takes those Isekai cliches and makes fun of them. Meanwhile another good Isekai you could watch is Isekai Seikishi Monogatari which is a Tenchi Muyou spin-off (the title I mentioned earlier) and is frankly my personal favorite Isekai since it not only has a proper centered plot but it divides the episodes into two parts the first being all the fanservice and the second being all the plot so it helps as everyone gets what they want.Whatever the matter. If you do choose to watch the anime I recommended or instead decide to watch Death March or Isekai Smartphone, keep in mind that this is a genre heavily influenced by the SAO effect and that it doesn\'t look like that effect will hold down soon. Yet there\'s still light at the end of the tunnel. Will we see a good Isekai sometime soon? I sure do hope so. As for now, time to wait for the second season of Isekai Smartphone (groans inside)Overall Rating: 4.2P.S: I rarely do my best girl columns since I made my new format but I\'ll bring it back next time since I didn\'t find anyone in Death March interesting. Maybe Liza was a bit fun to watch in the earlier episodes and Nana was cute but no one interested me much to call them the ""best girl"". So apologies hardcore Otakus.', ""Oh, shit another one of these, jaz wtf is studio Silver Link and Connect were think when they come up with something like this?

Objectively speaking, numbers are a pretty bad way to judge this kind of shows that only target a very specific audience."", 'Death March is the most pro-slavery tract of fiction produced since the end of the American Civil War. Death March\'s main character, Satou, is the most insidiously passive protagonist I think I have ever encountered. When thrown into a world with a legal and normalized institution of slavery, which includes the prostitution of children, Satou is apathetic at best – and eagerly complicit at worst. Satou is a fucking sociopath.Let’s explore this.Satou is thrust into a fantasy world (with inconsistent video game elements because there is no spark of originality to be found here) and, of course, he’s totally overpowered from the get-go. He soon...enters a city where slavery is accepted, slaves are peddled alongside food items and clothing, and slaves are publicly beaten. The people of this city have no problems showcasing their vehement racism towards “inferior” races. This place is fantasy as imagined by Adolf Hitler, a setting even grimmer than Berserk. None of this phases our hero.He may not care to watch abuse, and he may think the abusive slave owner is a jerk, but that’s where it ends. He questions nothing about this society or its morals. The problem with the abusive slave owner isn’t that he’s a slave owner – it’s that he’s not a nice slave owner.Events conspire to give Satou his own cadre of slave girls (Pochi and Tama, who are 10 years old, and Liza). He adapts quickly to giving orders and having them at his mercy. When they reach the surface, he immediately purchases two more slave girls for his harem: Lulu, 14, and Arisa, 11. In for a penny, in for a pound, right?I’ll be generous and concede that he needed to order Liza, Pochi, and Tama around because of extraordinary circumstances. Once the danger has passed, however, at no point does he ever consider setting them free. In fact, he seems to think that keeping them as slaves is the NICE thing to do.Satou, delivering the very last line in Episode 5: ""They don\'t deserve to be treated like slaves, but they feel more at ease that way.""Oh, well, that makes it so much better. It’s so comforting to know he’s considering the feelings of his human chattel.When Liza, Pochi, and Toma are denied room and board because of their race/species, they are graciously given a spot in the stable – like animals. Satou callously leaves them to sleep in a sty while keeping the bed for himself and his two human slaves.When Lulu and Arisa (again, 14 and 11 respectively) present themselves naked, he is utterly unfazed by the prospect of child prostitution. His only response: “Oh, they have that kind of slavery here, too.” There is no hint of disgust, or even discomfort. The only problem is that it’s just not his bag.And you know, for as many times as Satou insists “I’m not a lolicon,” it’s a little suspicious how he keeps finding himself surrounded by naked and sexually available children. Maybe he just gets off on exerting his dominance over them – choosing what they do, what they eat, and dressing them up like dolls. Then again, he kisses a prepubescent dryad girl not once, but twice in Episode 8. The show tries to excuse this by having the little girl proclaim her need for MP – but our hero doesn’t even think of just handing over an MP potion, which was shown to be effective just one episode earlier. Perhaps Satou only feels emboldened to act on his pedophilic urges when he’s alone.Moving from his moral transgressions, Satou is stupid in ways too stupid for stupid people. He is granted a basically unlimited pool of skill points, but instead of leveling every useful skill immediately, he only applies skill points the moment he needs them. For a computer programmer, he seems to lack any sense of long-term thinking.Satou is solely out for his own self-gratification, unconcerned about the heinous state of the world or the evil that plagues it. All of his so-called “heroic” and “selfless” acts revolve around little girls or little girls that resemble house pets. To quote The Criminal Personality, by Samuel Yochelson and Stanton Samenow, “The criminal\'s sentimentality reveals itself in compassion for babies and pets.” Notice how little of a shit he seems to give about anyone not a girl or past puberty. His niceness is all a hollow, shallow front, a mask for the uncaring monster underneath.Seriously, go look up the DSM-V guidelines for Antisocial Personality Disorder. These are the criteria professionals use to determine if someone is a sociopath – and Satou hits all the necessary marks. Satou is a less outwardly criminal, yet more unfeeling and callous take on Tony Soprano. Hell, I\'d rather spend an evening with Hannibal Lecter - at least he has a personality and a voice that doesn\'t sound like nails on a chalkboard.So why is Satou our protagonist? Does the show realize how monstrous he is? You can center a story on an antihero or even a villainous sociopath, but Death March seems totally unaware of how Satou comes across. Instead, it’s littered with scenes of Satou feeding, clothing, and bathing his slaves, as if that will make us like and admire him.  I would hope that any morally sound person living in our time is going to see ""doesn\'t treat slaves  like shit"" as the bare fucking minimum for goodness – but for the creators Death March, that’s all it takes.This show is a moral trash fire, and it’s kind of fascinating in that regard. Otherwise, all you have is a sparsely animated, thinly written, and shamelessly lazy addition to the overstuffed isekai genre. I would hope people are only watching this kind of stuff ironically – but I’m not so optimistic. Thinking that this is marketed to children makes me want to throw up.It doesn’t deserve any more analysis. It deserves to be buried and forgotten – the sooner, the better.End of Series Update: Satou acquires two more harem slaves, a prepubescent elf child and Violet Evergarden. He heroically saves a horde of submissive, busty blondes and helps another prepubescent child.

Just a while ago it seemed like the “traditional” isekai was on the way out, with the most notable entries in the genre being subversive takes on the premise of being transported to another world such as Konosuba or Re:Zero. In hindsight, they were mere blips, as it appears we are living in a new golden age of isekai anime, given the upcoming adaptations of Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu and Hyakuren no Haou to Seiyaku no Valkyria. If Death March is any indication of the quality of these upcoming shows, we’re in for a rough ride.At...first glance, Death March’s premise is somewhat interesting. An overworked game developer gets transported into the world of one of the games he’s working on, complete with a standard MMO UI. Those ten minutes in the first episode, in which the viewer learns about how shitty the MC’s job is, ends up becoming the most interesting part of Death March. As well as being a much realistic take on game development than New Game, it firmly establishes a reason for the MC to want to stay within the new world.However Death March quickly squanders whatever goodwill it built up when the OP begins.The OpeningThere’s no sugarcoating this. Slide Ride is one of, if not the worst, anime openings I have ever experienced in my life. The song itself is terrible; A cobbled together mess of various elements that fails to come together into any sort of coherent melody or rhythm. Instead of complimenting each other, the instrumentals and vocals actively clash, exposing each other’s flaws more so. The whole song comes off as cheap, as if the whole thing was put together after one take.The animation and structure of the opening don’t fair much better. The quick flashes of the girls of Satou’s harem fail to establish them as distinct characters, whilst the show’s titlecard is interspersed with annoying shots of the MMO’s UI and menus. And yet the worst is to come.While Slide Ride’s chorus does its best to make your ears bleed, the action sequence chosen to show off how badass the main character is merely consists of him walking up a cliff and shooting a giant rolling boulder, saving two of his underaged slaves in the process. By contrast, Smartphone’s OP, even with its poor animation, at least showed the MC and his harem fighting together against various monsters, doing a much better job at building audience expectations.Death March’s OP does none of that. By pure accident, it ends up becoming a perfect symbol of the show itself.Plot and CharactersDeath March can best be described as slice-of-life isekai, with the series largely consisting of short vignettes of Satou and his harem, broken up by occasional attempts at a story arc. The problem is that the show makes these little vignettes boring as hell, failing to take advantage of the fantasy world setting in any meaningful way.But it’s largely down to the characters. A good cast can turn even the most mundane situations into something worth watching. However, this is Death March.Once again, we have a bland, nonchalant, over-powered male protagonist. The fact that he was an adult prior to being transported to a fantasy hardly plays into how Satou reacts to situations around him, and generally he feels like any other teenaged male isekai protagonist.Him being overpowered also robs the story of any sort of tension. We know, from a hilarious sequence early on the first episode in which Satou levels to over 300 by dropping meteors on CGI lizardmen, that nothing in this world offers much of a challenge. When anything appears that might present a challenge, Satou simply dumps points into a relevant skill and resolves it without much issue.The rest of Satou’s harem, fails to make much of an impression either, with personalities ranging from non-existent to one-dimensional. They also contribute to the increasingly irritating isekai trend of being slaves of the protagonist, in order to give them an easy justification to follow the MC. To Satou’s credit, he does refuse any form of sexual contact, but the ultimate effect is to make him even more bland.Because of all this, the show’s various scenarios simply flow past without any meaningful impact. I frequently struggled to recall the events of the episode just minutes after I finished watching each episode.AnimationDeath March’s one unique gimmick, that of Satou being able to see a MMO UI, ends up being a distraction from the other things that are happening on screen. Aside from a few bits of visual comedy, the menus mostly exist to introduce characters and settings in a lazy manner, and reinforce the increasingly ridiculously long list of MMO titles Satou has acquired, reminding the audience of how much an overpowered badass Satou is.Unintentionally, having Satou resolve things so easily is a blessing in disguise, as it saves the audience from having to withstand Death March’s action scenes for any longer. The show’s already limited animation really suffers during bits of action, with stiff movement, poor direction and CGI that would have been laughed at ten years ago.Even in normal times, the show fails to rise above mediocre in the art department. Death March has a strange pastel-like quality to the colours, and the overall design of the world could be from any medieval-themed game or anime. Most irritating is the filter that is slapped across the viewer whenever we see Satou’s perspective. Meant to emulate depth of field, it ends up distorting the image and making everything seem like a blurry mess.ConclusionDeath March fails as an adaptation of the light novel, and neither does it stand as a standalone product.It, along with Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, serve as examples of the worse traits of isekai stories, with blatant wish fulfillment, non-existent plot and flat characterization. Normally, such a show would be merely forgettable, but in a season stacked as Winter 2018, it's flaws stand out even more so.Basically, if you want mundane but comfy slice of life, just watch Yurucamp. Don't waste your time on Death March. first glance, Death March’s premise is somewhat interesting. An overworked game developer gets transported into the world of one of the games he’s working on, complete with a standard MMO UI. Those ten minutes in the first episode, in which the viewer learns about how shitty the MC’s job is, ends up becoming the most interesting part of Death March. As well as being a much realistic take on game development than New Game, it firmly establishes a reason for the MC to want to stay within the new world.However Death March quickly squanders whatever goodwill it built up when the OP begins.The OpeningThere’s no sugarcoating this. Slide Ride is one of, if not the worst, anime openings I have ever experienced in my life. The song itself is terrible; A cobbled together mess of various elements that fails to come together into any sort of coherent melody or rhythm. Instead of complimenting each other, the instrumentals and vocals actively clash, exposing each other’s flaws more so. The whole song comes off as cheap, as if the whole thing was put together after one take.The animation and structure of the opening don’t fair much better. The quick flashes of the girls of Satou’s harem fail to establish them as distinct characters, whilst the show’s titlecard is interspersed with annoying shots of the MMO’s UI and menus. And yet the worst is to come.While Slide Ride’s chorus does its best to make your ears bleed, the action sequence chosen to show off how badass the main character is merely consists of him walking up a cliff and shooting a giant rolling boulder, saving two of his underaged slaves in the process. By contrast, Smartphone’s OP, even with its poor animation, at least showed the MC and his harem fighting together against various monsters, doing a much better job at building audience expectations.Death March’s OP does none of that. By pure accident, it ends up becoming a perfect symbol of the show itself.Plot and CharactersDeath March can best be described as slice-of-life isekai, with the series largely consisting of short vignettes of Satou and his harem, broken up by occasional attempts at a story arc. The problem is that the show makes these little vignettes boring as hell, failing to take advantage of the fantasy world setting in any meaningful way.But it’s largely down to the characters. A good cast can turn even the most mundane situations into something worth watching. However, this is Death March.Once again, we have a bland, nonchalant, over-powered male protagonist. The fact that he was an adult prior to being transported to a fantasy hardly plays into how Satou reacts to situations around him, and generally he feels like any other teenaged male isekai protagonist.Him being overpowered also robs the story of any sort of tension. We know, from a hilarious sequence early on the first episode in which Satou levels to over 300 by dropping meteors on CGI lizardmen, that nothing in this world offers much of a challenge. When anything appears that might present a challenge, Satou simply dumps points into a relevant skill and resolves it without much issue.The rest of Satou’s harem, fails to make much of an impression either, with personalities ranging from non-existent to one-dimensional. They also contribute to the increasingly irritating isekai trend of being slaves of the protagonist, in order to give them an easy justification to follow the MC. To Satou’s credit, he does refuse any form of sexual contact, but the ultimate effect is to make him even more bland.Because of all this, the show’s various scenarios simply flow past without any meaningful impact. I frequently struggled to recall the events of the episode just minutes after I finished watching each episode.AnimationDeath March’s one unique gimmick, that of Satou being able to see a MMO UI, ends up being a distraction from the other things that are happening on screen. Aside from a few bits of visual comedy, the menus mostly exist to introduce characters and settings in a lazy manner, and reinforce the increasingly ridiculously long list of MMO titles Satou has acquired, reminding the audience of how much an overpowered badass Satou is.Unintentionally, having Satou resolve things so easily is a blessing in disguise, as it saves the audience from having to withstand Death March’s action scenes for any longer. The show’s already limited animation really suffers during bits of action, with stiff movement, poor direction and CGI that would have been laughed at ten years ago.Even in normal times, the show fails to rise above mediocre in the art department. Death March has a strange pastel-like quality to the colours, and the overall design of the world could be from any medieval-themed game or anime. Most irritating is the filter that is slapped across the viewer whenever we see Satou’s perspective. Meant to emulate depth of field, it ends up distorting the image and making everything seem like a blurry mess.ConclusionDeath March fails as an adaptation of the light novel, and neither does it stand as a standalone product.It, along with Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, serve as examples of the worse traits of isekai stories, with blatant wish fulfillment, non-existent plot and flat characterization. Normally, such a show would be merely forgettable, but in a season stacked as Winter 2018, it's flaws stand out even more so.Basically, if you want mundane but comfy slice of life, just watch Yurucamp. Don't waste your time on Death March."", ""Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku Anime ReviewBy: Ainana HiroApril 25 2019Overall: 9.2Plot: 8What if one day you wake up and you're already in a game? What if your normal disastrous and stressful life turns into a more enjoyable one? This kind of theme is not new in an anime series. It is rather famous and currently one of the most picked plot. The story starts with the protagonist Satou and his busy life as a game creator at the age of 29. Sounds amazing, right? Though it isn't. He spent days and days fixing bugs in different games without having the time to rest...at all. One night when sleep comes to him, he woke up seeing himself in a life or death situation, with features of a game only he can see, with a familiar place he already saw, with the age of 15. His journey began upon the realization that he isn't dreaming.Unlike other MMORPG themed anime series, this one slightly touch the core of being in a game such as doing raids, having guilds, PVP. It contains of more simple things in a game such as obtaining different skills and titles, mastering different professions like crafting and alchemy, living a peaceful like with the slaves he helped getting their freedom back. It focuses more on the little things of the game that is mostly taken forgranted. The anime pace is slow but satisfying. It is great to see a common concept of a story but with different shades of it.Characters: 9The protagonist of the story is overpowered, but not in a way most character is. His level is very high, yes. But the familiarity of every skills and the game itself needs time. His character is calm and smart. That even if he was brought to a different world, his 29 years old self won't change. It is cute how he is always smiling and have a pleasant look on his face. It is also amazing how he made choices depending on what will be the outcome and not just pure instinct to show his strength. This story is a harem and there are different girls on his circle. Their too cute and funny. And it is cool how the author made a limit on them in between of master and just fan service. I just really don't like that one character who keeps on flaunting on the protagonist assuming their relationship. I hate her, honestly.Sound and Animation: 10I freaking love the voice of tama. It's so cute and funny. It feels like watching a very irresistible pet in front of you. Her voice is the best! The shift of the animation from the viewers perspective to the protagonists itself is also cool. It is shown how the surrounding should be in his eyes since there is menu only he can see. Though the protagonist looks like the typical character with a black hair and a black clothes long enough to hide his body, he is much different. Every characters of the story is cool on their own and it is a plus that neither of them all, nothing acts like an NPC, remembered Emilia.Enjoyment: 10This anime is so satisfying. I felt like playing some MMORPG my whole life. Their daily adventures and moments felt like their just living normally. And I think that is what the author wanted the viewers to see. Its great to watch anime like this once in a while.Ending: 9I don't want this to end. I want to see more of their clever doings, their cuteness and innocence. The ending show how the protagonist make use of his skills, hiw he can helo others by using his mind than using his sword. I really love his character. Mature, calm, always smiling, reliable. Being near him will make you feel safe. Their struggles on the end and how they solve it is a great way to end the series. Though I think, this story is still ongoing and there's a still a lot of adventure they must take. Must check the manga of it. at all.

I found that it reminded me a lot of Overlord, in the way that the main characters in both are overpowered, albeit in different ways.The only real down side of this anime is that there's no real story. Actually, there's barely the scrapings of a plot, and there's almost zero character development.That being said, this anime ranks with not just Overlord, but No Game, No Life in the list of anime that I will happily buy and rewatch when I'm bored. It's a...fun, light romp through a generic MMORPG fantasy world. fun, light romp through a generic MMORPG fantasy world."", 'First and foremost, I\'m a big fan of Denno Coil, Sword Art Online, Hack, Log Horizon. When I first saw this anime, I was thinking ""Bleh... Another man sucked into game anime, they\'re probably going to mess it up, it\'s not going to be original...""I\'m happy to be proven wrong. The protagonist is a computer game programmer who gets sucked into some sort of game world that he seems to have help code or take part of coding. The game was a hardcore MMORPG before, but was recently patched so that it\'d be more casual player friendly. He went to sleep, and woke up in...the game.I do enjoy this anime a lot, because it\'s like playing a game getting tons of hacks, and granted free-roam, free-creation, free-interactions.

I have given this anime a perfect score because of its simplicity. The anime itself focuses on a man named Satou who is completely op. So if you enjoy watching a person breeze by life and having fun then this anime is for you. If you are looking for a serious anime or an anime with any decent plot or character development then do not watch this anime. Also I must point out that this is a harem anime and most likely will not appeal to female viewers.Th ', 'Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody has the single most overqualified score I’ve ever experienced in anime. Every single track is excellently suited to its task, and the way they all work together results in the perfect musical accompaniment for a whimsical, laid-back fantasy adventure more interested in the simple mundanities of life in a magical, quasi-Medieval world than any sort of grand, epic journey. The ED song in particular is so memorable and homey that I would rank it up with Konosuba’s fantastic relaxing fantasy/country fusions. There were so many moments across these twelve episodes where I found myself thinking, “Man, I’m really...going to enjoy listening to this music on Youtube once I finish watching this show. I might even imagine a better anime it hypothetically might have been used for so I can wash the stench of this fucking garbage out of my mouth.”Seriously, the quality gap between Death March’s score and every single other part of it is so freakishly large that I’m half convinced some inspired, rebellious composer snuck into Silver Link’s studios some time during post-production and proceeded to record over whatever generic, lifeless musical mush was intended to be the soundtrack, just to fuck with the studio execs. Or maybe he just did it on principle, as part of some heroic quest to ensure that no anime production will ever be allowed to slop onto screens and streaming services without at least one commendable quality. Someday, I would like to meet this revolutionary man of music, to learn his craft and understand his ways, so that he may inspire me in the same way he is so clearly inspired by anime as a medium. Perhaps that day will never come. But I will hope on regardless, because the mystery he left me with is by far the only interesting thing to come out of Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody, and were it not for his contributions, I would have spent six hours on this show and gotten nothing in return. So thank you, mystery man of music. Thank you for ensuring I at least had something, anything, of value to hold onto in this utter waste of a show with otherwise no redeeming qualities whatsoever.The truly sad thing is, none of what I said in those opening paragraphs is hyperbole. Death March to the Absurdly Overextended LN Title is, without a doubt, the single most useless anime I’ve ever experienced, to the point where wondering how such a brainless fart of a show somehow obtained its one aspect of quality was the only thing keeping me from going insane due to excessive boredom. It is truly remarkable how completely unremarkable this show is, how not a single moment lands with any emotional impact, how not a single aspect feels like it was crafted with anything more than base-level commercial cynicism, how utterly disinterested it appears to be in its own existence. It’s the animated embodiment of a vegetative state; the only thing separating it from complete nonexistence is the fact that it technically does exist, and you can’t help but feel that pulling the plug and putting it out of its misery would be a mercy to everyone. There is no reason for this show to exist. There is no reason for me to have watched it beyond the first episode. But I’m an anal-retentive moron who never likes leaving a job unfinished, so here we are. And hey, at least now I can pass the warning along to you, so now you won’t be tricked into thinking the SIXTH MOST POPULAR SHOW IN ITS SEASON might be worth your time in any way. Seriously, this shit has more members on MAL than Place Further Than the Universe, how the fuck is that in any way justifiable?I’d summarize the plot, such as it is, but that would be given this show far too much credit. It’s an isekai, so you already know the drill: teenage guy gets transported to a RPG-based fantasy world, instantly becomes the most powerful motherfucker in existence who gets all the girls and never has to be meaningfully challenged in any way, whether physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally, or any other way that might actually make for a halfway-compelling story. Okay, technically, this guy’s in his thirties and working at a video game company (he gets sucked into the world of the RPG he and his team have been struggling to finish), but he reverts back to his teenage self the moment he sets foot in Candyland, so it doesn’t make a difference. And technically he’s not a virginal weirdo who can’t process sex through anything other than nosebleeds; he actually does get laid a couple times... but only offscreen and by random one-off prostitute NPCs we barely get to see, not by any of his steadily accumulating harem. Then again, considering how many members of his harem are Literal Children, perhaps that’s for the best. But on the other hand, at least if this show evoked moral outrage in me, that would, in fact, be a reaction of SOME kind. And that would have had some value, any value.But no, the fact of the matter is, this show has no idea of where it wants to go, and it spends the entirety of its run time going nowhere, advancing no character arcs, plotting no greater narratives, introducing no interesting tidbits of worldbuilding, setting up no fun group dynamics for the central team to have any sort of chemistry, pulling off no feats of even notable animation, and never even attempting to rescue itself from its own lack of inertia. Again, no hyperbole here; we spend twelve goddamn episodes with Satou and his ever-growing harem and the only thing that changes in any of them between the start and end is that more girls just keep getting added. The few stabs at genuine emotion skip the apparently unnecessary process of making you actually, like, care about these characters and just assume you’ll already be invested in their well-being from the second they’re on screen. Meanwhile, the vast majority of the show’s run time is spent on watching this personality-defunct team going camping, eating dinner, learning to leaf-whistle, and a million other boring little distractions that do nothing to endear us to the characters in any way. But at least the complete lack of narrative moment is only boring, whereas the fight scenes are both boring and ugly as sin. Clearly I need to apologize to Overlord, because I was not aware of how abysmal CG monsters could look.There’s something almost infuriating about how little effort was put into this show, how clearly no one working on it (besides the aforementioned symphonic daredevil) gave any sort of shit at all. It isn’t even trying to hide the naked cynicism of its existence, the fact that it only exists for the sake of selling the cheapest possible power fantasy and profiting off the rock-bottom standards it imagines its audience to have. But then it can’t even do the power fantasy well enough to justify the callous disregard for quality on display. None of the girls are interesting or hot, even by the very generous standards of cheap waifu bait; they might as well not even have personalities at all, for how token and half-assed their supposed fetish gimmicks are. The deadpan isn’t much of a deadpan, the hardass isn’t much of a hardass, the snarker isn’t much of a snarker, the flustered virgin isn’t much of a, well, you get the point. The only one who leaves any sort of impression is the bratty, squeaky-voiced, and that’s solely due to the rising desire to gag her with a dirty sock before she throws one more obnoxious tantrum about wanting to jump Satou’s completely uninteresting wizard staff, may it remain forever flaccid.And speaking of Satou himself, good fucking god, he is legitimately the most insufferably bland motherfucker to ever grace the protagonist role. I don’t know whose decision it was that he should deliver all of his lines in the exact same quasi-paternal nice-guy drawl with an aw-shucks half-smile, but whoever it was should be fired, because the end result makes you want to reach through the screen and scream “EMOTE!!!” in his face, just so he gets pissed off and shows that he has the capacity for at least a single other emotional state. Especially when his nice-guy fantasy presentation clashes with his tendency to objectify every woman and girl he comes across, making internal comments about their boobs and attractiveness in the same dreamily genial way he patronizes them in reality. Because that’s what real nice guys do, right? Oh, and he’s not a lolicon. He’s definitely not a lolicon. It’s one of he first things his internal monologue tells us, so he definitely wants you to know that he’s not a lolicon. Never mind how much he clearly enjoys the felling of a thirteen-year-old’s boobs pressing against him, he is in no way a lolicon. And maybe if he tips his fedora harder, he can make you forget that most of the girls in his harem are his actual slaves, all of whom he took from other owners and could free at a moment’s notice with no averse affects or risk of them abandoning him, making them his equal traveling companions, but chooses not to because... I guess he gets off on being called “Master” by a ten-year-old cat girl. But he’s not a lolicon, guys.

Just like another Isekai, transported to another fantasy world with a magic. But hey, it seems this world is a game that he made.The story is just 'like that'. Not a serious one, with some comedy spices, make it so light. But plot still nothing special, just a nice guy named Satoo who very overpower helping many people. Oh WOW... what a nice guy. Satoo didn't want everyone know about his super power, but look at this! I can jump so god damn high! Look at this look at this!

The show is about an overworked video game programmer who falls asleep after an exhausting day at work and suddenly wakes up in a video game-like fantasy world where he has been summoned by an unknown person (to be a hero against the forces of the Demon Lord who threatens the kingdom - that part's not important to the plot at all). The show’s (cliché) premise and edgy title imply that the series will be dark and full of action, but instead the show is extremely slow paced, features almost no action of any kind,...and instead focuses on our hero Satou’s travels around the world with his ever growing harem of slave girls with no distinct personalities… Yeah…The problems with the show start in the second episode, in which Satou starts as a powerless Level 1 player threatened by an army of Lizard Men, only to be saved by a nonsense Deus Ex Machina meteor shower that somewhow jumps his level and wealth up immensely and make him overpowered to the point of nothing that happens in the show really mattering. Every time he encounters a problem, all he does is increase his skill levels and suddenly he can do anything and beat any problem, i.e. there is no tension at any point in the series since he doesn’t need to strategise or plan anything and is never in real danger. Satou also has a consistent love interest throughout the show named Zena (his pseudo-harem being made up of slaves he bought to rescue from abusive masters), who despite being the only interesting character in the show (since all of the slave girls have the same hyper-devoted personality and Satou has no personality) is constantly shafted for screen time so that the other slave girls can be sexualised to disturbing levels (which are even more disturbing when you realise that Satou is 29 and some of these girls are as young as 11).Fortunately, Satou himself never once actually engages in paedophilic behaviour, but unfortunately despite the fact that the show goe out of its way to show the blossoming romance between him and Zena, it’s impossible to ship that romance since despite specifically talking about places he wants to take her he visits and is serviced by two brothels during the course of the series (and don’t you dare say that he didn’t actually sleep with those prostitutes, since we see that his skill box has several “sexual skills” added to it after one of his visits. So, Satou is unfaithful to his not-quite-girlfriend, overpowered, and has no personality… oh, and he looks suspiciously like Kitiro from Sword Art Online because the character designers were lazy.To make matters worse, what few action scenes the show has are extremely underwhelming visually, as is the rest of the animation. The battles with the Undead King’s minions during the arc where the elf princess was kidnapped could have been visually stunning, but instead the animation looked cheap and lacked anything in terms of visual effects or dynamic camera movements. This is a real shame because the studio that made this, Silver Link, actually have made some superbly animated action sequences in Fate/Kaleid, and the studio that assisted in the animation, Studio Connect, are known for having almost exclusively made action-based anime… so, everything in this series seems to come down to laziness, both in the writing and in the animation.Furthermore, during the Undead King arc, Satou cheats his way through the challenges with the help of a teleporting-powered plant loli, so any and all excitement you might feel about him having to find a way through to the top of the monster and challenge infested tower is dashed immediately by a lazy get-out-of-trouble-free-card deus ex machina.To make matters worse, the Demon Lord who is set up from the start never even features, and the entire series builds towards an unbearable anti-climax that I won’t spoil for anyone insane enough to want to watch the show (but involves saving a forest from a noble that wants to shop it down), we never find out anything about why the events of the series are taking place, and there are so many cringy moments of underage fanservice that it made me almost want to gouge my eyes out.In the end, what starts as a cliché but promising fantasy series gradually waters down into a boring tensionless “cute girls doing cute things” series with no character development or plot of any kind.

There. I just solved half the problems people seem to encounter when going into this show. Note there will be some minor spoilers in this review. Death March is a pretty standard Isekai; we have our MC show up as a 15 year old boy, he's suddenly transported to a fantasy world, he's pretty OP, and yay, he has a harem. However, despite the fact that I tend to loathe harem situations, I'm actually really enjoying this show. I'll give you a run down.Story: 7Honestly? There really isn't one. Why? Because, despite...the Isekai genre, its a Slice of Life anime at its core. There are some pretty cool action scenes, but a great deal of the show is world building, and exploring the culture and magic of this new world. We get a short action-orientated arc here and there to break it up, but sometimes they feel a little rushed in their execution. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the MC learn about the world and take care of his companions, and I like watching him learning his new skills and showing off occasionally. It's relaxing.I would like make a disclaimer that there is, in fact, slavery in this anime. Is it sexualised? No. Is is glorified? No. Does it gloss over how morally wrong it is own to slaves? Yeah, sometimes. The world is meant to parallel the traditional European medieval setting, where slaves were a thing, and often uses the all-too -common racial discrimination trope as a basis. In this world, its demi-humans with the short end of the stick.The slaves are not abused by the MC, and I'll concede that they do still show a significant amount of mental scarring that came with being treated, as well, slaves. The justification they use to insist on remaining slaves, though, (because, well, gratitude?) is a little weird. Overall, it's not really clear, and I'm not super comfortable with it, but the MC gave up arguing and now they're assigned companions now I suppose.Art: 8Everything is quite high quality, in the typical modern anime way. The whole anime seems to have a bit of a blue 'film' over it, which becomes more intense through the MC's point of view, which gives the whole 'hey, this is a video game like place, yeah?' feel. It can get a little annoying sometimes in areas that supposed to have lots of yellow. All the characters are distinctive in their looks, and the backgrounds are very good.Sound: 7Nothing memorable, but overall decent. Opening and ending aren't amazing, but I don't skip it every time.Characters: 7Honestly? A little bland. They're all likeable, and have very distinct personalities, I don't want to kick even the villains in the face, but they feel very NPC. I suppose that's kind of the point, but he is supposed to be in a fantasy world that works like a game, not the other way around. For example, the children do not actually act like children. No child doesn't at least get grabby sometimes, or a little whiny. The characters don't seem to have proper flaws beyond 'this one is naive' and 'this one is prideful' and even then it's 'not too prideful though' and 'not too naive though'. The MC is a little bland. His two settings seem to be 'this is okay' and 'this is slightly worrying'. He very rarely gets surprised, or angrier beyond annoyance, and maybe it's the disassociation that comes with have an interface over everything you do, but he doesn't ever say anything 'wrong' or mean'. He also makes very few mistakes. The fact that's in actuality a 28-year old stuck in a 15 year old's body makes for a refreshingly mature character at least, and really tones down the romance, where he's more playing along than invested. Overall he think the teen crushes are all kinda cute and temporary, which is kinda refreshing, if somewhat assholish.Enjoyment: 8Overall, a very relaxing anime to watch, with a lot of world building and fantasy concepts.

So I have to say, I'm almost impressed at how bad this show was, considering the general lackluster quality of this variety of anime. It would be overpraising Death March to say that it is generic - as it fails to reach even the lowest bar of quality that your average isekai does.The lead character is the most personality-less fictional character I think I have ever encountered. He somehow manages not only to avoid at all costs having his own characterization, he also actively drives...away the development of the characters around him. It's kind of amazing.And on the subject of characters, I think I won't be the first to point out how intensely creepy it is that the majority of female characters hovering around the lead character are literal children. And slaves. I've seen some push-back on this, as certain commenters claim that Satou is only acting as a father figure to the girls. However, slight SPOILERS, there are several episodes where the children are involved in fanservice-y moments with Satou. In the last episode alone, three little girls lick (or attempt to lick) a gooey substance from the lead's fingers while the background is sparkling. It's not exactly subtle.In terms of storytelling, Death March is much more a slice of life style isekai than anything else. This in an of itself is not a problem, but it becomes one when the characters that are being relied upon to carry the narrative are so lifeless.I wish I could say the show makes up for its faults in another way, but I found the soundtrack, character designs, animation, etc to be completely average.I can't say whether you would enjoy watching this series or not, that always varies from person to person - however, I think I can at least say that if you are looking for some fun fantasy escapism, there are so many better options out there. away the development of the characters around him.

It is not an ecchi anime/LN tho.).He is also caring towards children and his companions, and always thinking of the best decision for them.Tama and Pochi are cuteLiza is a girl that always wanted to protect his master, and meat.Arisa is a mischievous brat but he always thinking about his master\'s well being.Lulu is shy fragile flower, but looks can fool you.

I give it 7/10---ART---I have no complains in Art department. The animation is good but the action sequence is a little bit lacking. The colors and the environments is superb i must say. I give it 8/10---SOUND---It\'s good. 7/10---CHARACTER---We got a 29 years old as a main character is rather refreshing for a shounen anime. He is also not that dense and will lay his hand on onee-sans if he could (but too bad tho, in the anime, they tune it down. It is not an ecchi anime/LN tho.).He is also caring towards children and his companions, and always thinking of the best decision for them.Tama and Pochi are cuteLiza is a girl that always wanted to protect his master, and meat.Arisa is a mischievous brat but he always thinking about his master\'s well being.Lulu is shy fragile flower, but looks can fool you. No one in his party is useless burden.No Tsundere in their main party is a plus point for me.

I don't particularly have anything against isekai, hell I don't even mind the character being over-powered (which he was), what I do have a problem with is when a character doesn't seem to fit with who was before in the previous world.The main character starts as 30 year old, but as soon as he gets to the alternate world, within 15 minutes his voice changes and sounds like 13 year old. His actions, like all other anime in this genre, does not reflect a 30 year old.There...is no plot, there is no clear story-line and as with the most of these type of shows the main character weak.My recommendation: Better of watching a hentai, it is far more fulfilling than this crap. is no plot, there is no clear story-line and as with the most of these type of shows the main character weak.My recommendation: Better of watching a hentai, it is far more fulfilling than this crap."", 'Man. I\'m sad.I loved the books. They are some of my favorite light novels, because they have no pretenses of being anything but an isekai slice of life, and they manage to do it in such an absurdly over-the-top way that it\'s funny.The anime... fails to live up to any of my expectations. The plot is conveyed badly, the art and sound design is just passable, the characters aren\'t done well, and as a result my enjoyment suffered.""How can the plot be conveyed badly?"" I hear you ask. ""There was never much plot to begin with!"" You would be correct. The reason its conveyed badly...is because Satou\'s inner monologue is the key element in how the story is conveyed.The anime doesn\'t give you the funny lines where Satou thinks things like ""The demon looked like it might cause issues if I left it around, so I killed it on my way to get lunch."" The books are full of stuff like that, where you have a ""wait, what?"" moment because of how casually and offhand satou mentions absurd things. When you take out the inner monologue, it just becomes a classic Mary Sue, and you miss out on the humor intended by the conflict of his casual attitude with his over the top actions.Not only that, but a large portion of the plot revolves around Satou using his system to learn and max out skills at absurd speed. But in the anime they didn\'t even bother to translate the on screen text which tells you when he acquires skills, which was another thing that was humorous, having situations where satou does really minor things to get absurd skills.All in all, it takes a pure absurd comedy and turns it into a generic isekai plot, losing 90% of its charm.All in all, I am very disappointed. I have to give it a 5, and that\'s generous. I want to give it more but I can\'t. Pass on the anime.But read the books.

Here, though... the pacing is mind-bogglingly slow, and it feels like it takes two episodes to present one episode worth of material.It also doesn\'t really have the ""peaceful silly fun"" atmosphere ""Smartphone"" had.So, all things considered, there is little reason to watch it.Detailed breakdown below:...Ratings:3/10 story, 5/10 art, 5/10 soudn, 4/10 character, 4/10 enjoyment, 4/10 overall.Story 3/10.It is usual (for nowadays, that is) ""game isekai"" where protagonist gets thrown into a game-like world, except he is overpowered. Similar titles are ""Overlord"", ""Smartphone"", ""Log Horizon"", and few others. ""Game isekai"" anime can only be fun when there\'s non -game conflict/story (like those in the good episodes of overlord), or when protagonist is overpowered in either a clever or fun way.None like that is in this anime. The whole thing feels like overly long exposition with next to non-existent conflict. The ""cute girls doing silly things"" aspect also isn\'t strong enough to make it fun.... so all things considered, it is bland and dull with exception of a few moments.Art: 5/10:Actually, it is decent with a slight touch of originality. One side character (golem) is quite cute and a bit unusual in design, protagonist is generic looking, and few small sidekicks could work as ""cute characters"" as well. THe whole thing feels a bit low-budget, though, and there are few noticeable instances of CG use, or ""animation saving"" tricks like panned shots, etc.I believe there was one or two decent ifght scenes with fluid movement, but fight scenes are so uncommon in this anime, that it doesn\'t really help.Soudn: 5/10:The ""watashi tachi no party"" ending sounded nice, and opening wasn\'t bad either, but overall the music simply doesn\'t stand out much.Character: 4/10:Walking stereotypical carton cutouts. Everybody is a stereotype, acts  their story role, and is not very believable.Enjoyement: 4/10:I found it to be dull. The events within episodes feel stretched, and it would be more intersting to watch the anime if it was ""compressed"" or had better writing. Overall it feels like this is 6 episode worth of events in it.OVerall: 4/10:It is boring to the point where it can put you to sleep. There is one nice moment in the beginning (fight), and nice moment in the middle (another fight), plus one somewhat cute/interesting character, but it is it.If you REALLY want to watch ""game isekai"" you could try ""smartphone"" instead, or first 5 episodes of overlord 2 (lizardmen arc). Those will be better.OVerall it is not, horrible, but it is so dull that I can\'t really recommend it.

The show is an adaption of a light novel series. Part of the purpose of such animes is to leave the viewer wanting to go and read the series. When I\'m left thinking, well, good thing I didn\'t buy the first novel that\'s not a good sign.Story: 3Probably being generous with a 3 here. The story is unoriginal and does nothing to try to spice it up. Main character gets trapped in a fantasy world, is overpowered from early on, and develops a harem. Oh, and...helps a few people during the series. That\'s pretty much the anime. While a small snippet of one episodes eludes to something bigger going on, as is usually the case when characters get trapped/sent to other worlds, I didn\'t care enough for the bigger picture to want to pursue the series further (plus even what was hinted at seemed like an overused plot idea). I\'m not saying that any anime that comes out now with the whole trapped/reincarnated/etc. in another world story is worth under a 5 rating; that premise is so flexible in ways to spice it up, to make it stand-out and fun, which is probably why it still is being used so frequently in anime and manga. This series was just not a good representative for such series.Art: 3Nothing extraordinary, experimental, cutting-edge, etc. While it didn\'t hurt the eyes, it was just boring.Sound: 3Just look at the above, though change eyes for ears.Characters: 2At first I was thinking the main character could actually be interesting due to him being on the more mature side; in the end, though, his maturity simply meant he always knew how to approach things calmly. He was boring, no other way to put it. The other characters composing his harem are also boring, often stereotypical, and even forgettable.Enjoyment: 2I can\'t say I really enjoyed the series much at all. It was blah the whole way. The series should have had a sign that said ""Nothing to see here, move along"".Overall: 3Now, perhaps for anyone simply wanting to see a mostly loli harem with little action actually occurring within the harem, this series is decent. For everyone else though, the series will likely come off boring, a rehash of ideas already being used for years now. I actually forgot the series ended last week, the final episode was so anti-climatic, that I didn\'t realize till this morning that the series didn\'t have a thirteenth final episode. I suggest to most people debating about whether to watch this series, as many others already have, to save the time and pick another series. helps a few people during the series.

I believe it was bad, but better then it should have been for what the show is. Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku is about a late 29 year old Game Programmer who gets transported to a game world where he is 15. In this game world, a bug occurs and the protagonist, known as Satoo, becomes a level over 300.That sounds familiar doesn't it. Through and through this is your typical Isekai show. Overpowered protagonist, harem, blank main character, everything. There are different kinds of quirks to this...show to at least attempt to set it apart. Like how every time Satoo does something you can see the U.I of the game come up to confirm that. It displays a stats screen, inventory, points that you get to spend on skills, when he uses an ability, and when he acquires/uses an item. This happens quite often. Its sort of distracting really. Another part of the show that I've noticed is about the fetishization of being a savoir. Most of not all of the harem girls are slaves who are indebted to our protagonist. These girls that were abused and extorted before being saved. And after being saved, is then treated kindly, then joining as part of the harem. This archetype of the slave character is common in these type of shows, but they are normally limited to one or 2 girls. But Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku has it for most of its main cast.This show is not very good, but by no means I hate this show. Its an isekai show for god's sake, the market is oversaturated, and it does nothing different. I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen much of this type of this show.

Let me acknowledge the elephant in the room: Death March is not something new. If I were to criticize it further, it is almost an SAO (Sword Art Online) + Overlord rip-off. However, what it has that made me watch it is not the deep plot nor character development, but the entertainment value that it offers. The story is light and filled with the usual troupes of Harem, Online Game and Action genre it would be so familiar to viewers that you wouldn\'t even care to notice it. You would definitely...watch this not for the story but for the journey and experiences that the characters are faced with.Art is Good (7). One of the things that I like about this anime is how it handles the gaming elements of the story. You will truly feel the vibe of its gaming elements through the menus, notifications, and achievements that the OP Main Character toggles or gains through his journey. The environment and characters are not lush enough to be worthy of watching on the highest quality as possible. so 480p to 720p is enough for you to appreciate the art.Sound is Good (8). What I especially love about the sound is the gaming sounds it uses to denote achievements and titles as well as using items, skills, and crafting. It really produces that gaming sound that makes you feel that you are watching a game. ""Slide Ride (スライドライド)"" by Run Girls, Run!, the opening theme is great and pumps you up on a grand adventure even though you are not going to get a grand one. ""Suki no Skill (スキノスキル)"" by Wake Up, Girls! is a nice ending song to end a light-hearted anime.Characters are Mediocre (5). The weakest part of this anime is the characters. They are all the usual character personalities with the usual quirks that you can find on every anime you have watched. The main character is no different. All throughout the series I was looking for a stronger motivation for the character or at least something that would take away his ""generic"" title, but nothing.The strange thing about this anime is even though I heavily criticize it on a lot of factors, I still greatly enjoy the series. I think that there are just some things that you enjoy even if the quality is sub-par. May that\'s why I like watching American B-Movies.

The MC doesnt even try to aim big like becoming the strongest mage or something, he just stays there doing absolutely NOTHING. This anime has NO STORY at all. The MC just stays from where he started, laazing around without doing anything. Now this might be a way of saying 'normal life' but this bored me out more than any other thing. This shit is going to the last place in my anime list. IF you want a MC thats strong and fight...people THEN DONT WATCH THIS SHIT. people THEN DONT WATCH THIS SHIT."", '90% of my review relates to the story and characters, so I\'m going to skim through the rest of the categories first.Art 3/5Average, nothing stands out and this ""magical"" world we see consists mostly of wooden towns and rocks.Sound 2/5Serviceable, although forgettable enough that I don\'t actually remember if there *was* music. And a very weird detail they have is that the magic language of the world isn\'t so much a language, as just speeding up a bunch of sounds until the wizard sounds like a chipmunk. It looks and sounds stupid and I don\'t know whose fault it is.Enjoyment 1/5Anecdote time! Slight spoiler warning,...but it illustrates my point: Satou eventually meets another reincarnated person who talks about being born as a princess, ruling a kingdom, then being overthrown by treacherous royals and sold into slavery, where she survives by virtue of her psychic magic. The first thing I thought hearing that was ""Wow, I would give anything to be watching that story instead, right now"".Story 1/5A lot of the arguments I\'ve seen between critics and fans of this show are based around the defense that this is supposed to be a peaceful and cozy life in a fantasy world, not some action-packed RPG. Which is a perfectly fine pitch - I love slow road trip stories like Mushi-shi, and I\'ve watched more purposefully cozy anime than I care to count. The problem here, being, 3/4 of Death March\'s episodes are devoted to Satou fighting monsters, demons, and evil wizards. It is barely the thing it claims to be! It takes 11 episodes to leave the starting town, on this supposed journey.Now, I recognize that there is the angle of ""Satou doesn\'t want to be some great hero, but the war still finds him"". Nothing that happens seems to be related to an overarching story that I can identify, and even if it later turns out they are, all of it is so generic and uninspired that I\'d rather rewatch a good show.I even tried to give it the benefit of the doubt - you know, maybe the novel was adapted poorly...but no, the pacing is just as bad.Characters 1/5Alright, everybody has talked this point to death I\'m sure, but...the slave girls. They\'re an anchor that drags this shit down. They have no personality. Oh sure, they individually have one or two character traits (mostly a shared trait called ""Loves Satou soooo much""), but there are so many of them that they just blend together into a homogeneous moe-blob. Usually, with a harem, you try to have a few personality types for variety, but with Death March, you only have two choices: an actual child, or block of wood.Satou is the real offender here though. He goes beyond/below being a self-insert isekai MC. He takes in all of these slaves under the pretense of ""I\'ll treat them well, so better they\'re with me than at risk of ending up with a bad person"", but he NEVER makes an attempt to free them or really treat them as equals. For Kami\'s sake, he gives the animal-girls literal pet names!I mean, if he was openly racist about it, that would at least be some sort of personality, but he has none. I remember a humorous point where he gets a skill called ""Poker Face"" when he\'s trying not to react to something, and all I could notice was that it was the exact same face he had been making up throughout the show so far. I think his expression changes a total of two or three times over the course of the entire show; mostly he just stares vacantly at a point slightly off-screen, which is probably what you\'ll be doing after watching this drudgery for any amount of time.Overall 2/5On a technical level, Death March is serviceable. Heck, if you make an effort to avoid reading into things (and this is literally the first isekai you\'ve ever watched), maybe you can enjoy it. At its core though, this is a lazily written harem show. The MC claims he loves and would never touch any of these girls, yet the show constantly goes out of its way to sexualize them (especially the underage ones). The show promises a magical world, but offers nothing imaginative beyond waving a D&D handbook in your face.Instead of slogging through 12 episodes that MIGHT lead to something if this doubtfully gets a second season, your time would be better spent finding any other isekai. Even a bad one would have some value in the cringe factor; Death March doesn\'t even have the decency to be dumpster fire. but it illustrates my point: Satou eventually meets another reincarnated person who talks about being born as a princess, ruling a kingdom, then being overthrown by treacherous royals and sold into slavery, where she survives by virtue of her psychic magic.

The ending song of the anime gives it all out.The anime could be considered as a spiritual predecessor to Konosuba. While Konosuba aims for Comedy, Death March focus is in the lighthearted and kind environment. The world itself may be unoriginal but the take the series takes to the genre is novel. Don\'t mistake it as an another harem, sure some people may like this however this is not what the series is about.The best way to describe the series is as follows: ""A slice of life One Punch Man with a very tender and positive outlook.""...I believe that I could have given this a 10 (Occasionally the Japanese style for harems went overboard . . . I don\'t like harems at all and I\'m still giving this a 9. I wish I could go for 10 because of how warm the series was.) Fortunately that was not an obstacle as the MC is reluctant in the first place due to story reasons and he is the definition of truly a nice guy.

This time is Isekai Smartphone to Tomo ni season 2.... sorry nah... it's Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku or Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody and it was awful!I love Isekai guys. I really do. Overlord was one of the first animes I watched and loved. Dan Machi aas well. But both Death March and Smartphone guy are crap. Comparing it Sword Art Online is almost an affront to it. Those two shows suffer  from the same problem I truly despise. Over Powerful characters. In Death March we follow Ichirou Suzuki who works at...a software company and it's transported to another world. Right from the start he finish off some lizards with a fireball that make him level 300 or so and from this moment on every people he meets are between level 1 to 15 or so. There aren't anyone more powerful than him. And everything he do he do it easily.  So, of course he sets to do what High School DxD main guy couldn't... Be a Harem King. And this guy is the man. He has by the last episode 8 girls range 10 or so 17/18 and all want to jump him down HARD. (okay not all but half!).The problem with the cast of females is that they are so many and so poorly written and most of them are alike or bland. After all they are characters from a game (minus one). From Liza, Ponchi or Tama who were slaves and were bought by Satou. But he doesn't end there Arisa & Lulu. Also Nana who is a Homonculus and become part of his harem - she has great boobs but unfortunately (or not) don't have a personality... Mia an elf princess and I am forgetting someone... But I tell you it doesn't matter. There is also soldier who he doesn't buy but saves in the first episode and that's Zena. It seems he has some legit interest in her but unfortunately the other gals don't let him pursue the feelings...So each three or four episodes follows a arc (maybe a light novel) and Ichirou deals with plain and easily putting one more girl in his harem...Boring little anime, with no real ending (after all the light novels keep coming out and suprises me how people enjoy it). As a novel it might be good to read before some more compliated novels and thus I compreehend the hype after all we all do that. I do that with Dan Machi per example or some warhammer novels. But comparing the anime to Overlord, Grimgar or even Dan Machi or god's sake (well not him) Youjo Senki is really saying that Mongólia has a international football team as Portugal or Germany. They are both football teams but they play in very different leagues.Sorry forgot to mention about the rest of the things... Art is okay - nothing to spectacular but fortunately not all girls have super boobs but they pretty generic comparing with other works from Silver Link. They really look the same with other characters from some of their shows.. good look ;) The sound it's there and serves its purpose but it's nothing too good.Overall it's one of those animes to watch between other animes but if you skipped it you would miss a thing.

Now dear reader I know that is a bold question, Overlordexists afterall, however, while Overlord is truly trash, it is not asdedicated to being insidous as Death March is.Death March wants you to know that MC is a Nice Guy, not only is he a NiceGuy he\'s superhumanly nice, he is the Stakhanovite drone in his shovelwarecapitalist enterprise selflessly sacrificing his own physical and mentalhealth so one more ingame currency pack can get sold. MC is not a realperson, he\'s not a character you can emphasise...with, he\'s a surrealmasochistic cut out with godlike powers with some cult leader tenancieswho we are supposed to know is a Nice Guy because he doesn\'t exploit thosearound him to the maximum extent that he can.

If the show had any more  of a hint of self-awareness I\'d thinkit was trying to make a point about desensitisation to traumaticconditions but I think that\'s an overly generous reading.The show is a grand tour of tired tropes and stock characters, there is nochemistry between characters (indeed the central cast of characters arequite literally MC\'s chattels). The show is so bad on these fronts that ifwe ever got any of MC\'s internal monologue I could believe this was meantas a critical deconstruction of a genre that\'s become a stale ouroboros. Idon\'t even want to dismiss that possibility, I want to hold on to the hopethat in the last episode we discover that MC had a complete mentalbreakdown as a result of his horrid working conditions, but I can\'t reallyimagine there\'s enough self-awareness in the show for that to be the case(also you know a show is probably bad if you want the whole thing to be apsychotic episode to forgive it its faults...).Setting aside all of the trash, even taking the show on its own merits asa adventure game romp it falls on its face, I can\'t quite grasp how we\'remeant to suspend disbelief where there\'s no risk or danger in a gameenvironment where MC has access to the console, in fact in the moments thatit does do that I find myself perplexed as to why he doesn\'t just h4x hisway through whatever obstacle is in front of him.

It completely threw me for a loop when I learned that Death March was getting an anime, and hopefully you will understand why I feel that way after this review. So I know where this story eventually develops to, but I can still understand all of the reviews complaining about the plot and story. And honestly, they should complain, because I don't think this story is anime worthy for the amount of episodes that they have given it.Now, I'm not complaining about the...pacing, about them packing too much info into too little episodes- in fact, the pacing is almost the same as it is in the novel. But that hasn't done a good thing for this show. This show is about slice of life over-powered protagonist going into a world where he can travel and discover new places, eat new foods, and find all the cliche' isekai (did i spell that right?) would-be protagonists that he eventually encounters. It is a story of comedy and satire on all the feudal magical worlds ever made. But the problem is, with the slow pacing and small number of episodes, Death March will never get to the core of what the show is about. At least we got to see the cute Tama and Pochi though!*Update*After finishing the series, all I can tell you is, if you haven't read the book, don't bother watching this. You won't feel anything for it and will probably be disappointed. The novel is meant to be enjoyed slowly over a long period of time, and is great light reading. But the only thing that this anime could have brought to the table was great animation, picture, and sound, and it never brought any of those things. It really is not worth your time.I would recommend the novel which sousetsuka is translating currently, because things do get more interesting, but there was too little in this adaptation of it. pacing, about them packing too much info into too little episodes- in fact, the pacing is almost the same as it is in the novel.

It was way to generic and was just constant cliché with more cliché. Its not that its completely bad, but it kinda sucked.Story - 4. The story was pretty bland. A guy ends up in an isekai world, pretty generic. It reminded me a lot of that time I got reincarnated into a slime. It had the same story and the same plot. Not to mention none of it was original. Many of the encounters were the same as many others. The only thing that was a little different was the approach of the story....The one thing that stands out to me in an op isekai genre is the beginning. Most don't do a good job describing the characters mentality before joining in on the isekai hype. It didn't make much sense and was hard to follow in the beginning.Art-6. The art and animation was detailed, but nothing out of the ordinary. It was really familiar and copied a lot of other art styles. The animation and the fighting scenes weren't that amazing. If you could compare it to jujutsu kaisen now, it wouldn't come near to how amazing the art and animation is. This anime didn't take risks making it seem out of the normal and honestly wasn't that good.Sound-3. Not much to say, the sound track was trash and completely overused, and the op wasn't something to brag about. It was generic, overused, bland, edgy, and didn't give any depth to feed my emotions.Character- 3. The characters have appeared in literally every way. Not to mention there were about 5 males in the entire series. It wasn't giving much diversity, and it didn't make much sense overall. Not to mention slavery. Slavery in this anime was bad. They made it so the owner had complete control. A good plot would've been a slave trying to kill her master and escaping. Although its generic and bland, it would've been better than this. And I'm sure it would've been better to watch than this sad sack of poop.Enjoyment- 4. I didn't really enjoy the anime. It was decent enough for me to bear through to the end. And the MC's voice acting skill wasn't too good. I'm sure this took a lot of work to create and I respect that effort, but, I wouldn't recommend this to a friend.Overall it wasn't good, but if you plan on watching it, there's nothing wrong with that.

There was nothing particularly good about this anime, and a few points that were terrible.First, this main character is among the most frustrating to watch I've encountered thus far. He's overpowered AF in this world, which is pretty common in isekai. He's modest and humble, which is also very common in this genre. However, there's a difference between not flaunting your abilities and refusing to use them to the point where you put other people in danger, just because you...don't like attention. On top of that, despite treating slaves well, he doesn't do anything about granting them higher status.Second, the plot isn't. There is none. It's a series of random adventures with no clear overall goal in mind, with poor pacing and terrible content. Even the parts that should have been interesting weren't, because it looked forced in execution and the main character diligently removed any excitement that could have taken place.Third, and this is minor compared to the story and character, the animation wasn't very good. Most of it was pretty normal looking, but there was more bad CG present than most animes. Just enough to knock it a point below average in this aspect.As for sound and enjoyment - nothing stood out to me about the soundtrack, neither for better nor for worse, and despite being a terrible anime in my opinion I still was drawn to it somewhat because I'm an isekai junkie.So there you have it, the recipe for an overall score of 3 in the genre I adore. don't like attention.

And it\'s fine exactly because of this.What DM does better than most is the prelude of the story involving MC and his way of life, it\'s more involved, makes more sense and has some thought put into it. The ironic nature of MC gaining his ""op"" powers also works logically well as without a single nuance MC didn\'t exactly have much going on for him in the beginning.Overall it could be better described as a road movie or a Slice of Life kinda story, rather than your typical - there...is a bad guy, go get him. In fact there really is no ""bad guy"" in the whole S1 and instead it focuses on world building, exploration of that world and the rules of it. I find that a great attempt among the bland - collect a team + kick ass anime that we usually get in the genre.Because of this, DM is easy to watch especially while having a meal or generally trying to pass time.Not exactly ecchi, while it has some moments, those are rather episodic and very mild. The only thing yet that I found rather weird (but this is generally a ""weird"" trend) is a strange view on slavery and how MC just goes on with it (in Shield Hero, MC at least wanted to fix that). The way it is, they might address it in S2 or later.Production quality is surprisingly good, visually it\'s pleasant, however animations occasionally drop the ball.Characters are your typical anime prototypes, but I lost hope in expecting generic commercial anime to provide any fresh takes on that, which is exactly why I value something like Redo the Healer for that specific reason.All in all it felt solid, fun time and unlike most Isekai aka MMO anime, this one HEAVILY plays with the UI/game/MMO part of it and I appreciate that.

In all honesty, Death March is neither of those shows, rather it's others representing extremes of what is present in the show.Specifically in Death March, the protagonist doesn't play the usual clueless 17 year old male with an insatiable sex drive. Rather, he plays a 30 year old man in a 17 year old's body. Thus, he seems to handle situations closer to what a parent or adult would. He has a clean head, and...thus takes on the responsibility of all these slaves so they can live a better life. That doesn't mean the trash tones that others are noting about it being a harem show aren't there, however, the point is to contrast the usual reaction to a harem with someone who is interested in older women and being a loving father.Death March isn't a groundbreaking show, but the protagonist broke out of the mold enough I can see why people like it so much. However past this, there isn't much beyond Satou. Unfortunately, I don't believe (although I hope I'm wrong) that this show will get another season. It seems like this was a quick adaptation of a manga to fill the slots to air. There were hints to some interesting backstories to characters, however this wasn't really capitalized on in the short time we knew characters. It took a couple episodes to get the whole group together, so really going into backstory wasn't possible. The show itself would have benefited from a 20 episode season, because 12 just cut it a little too short. Arisa is fairly compelling, but as stated before they couldn't go in depth too much with the time they had.The style of the episodes were somewhat compelling, with Satou having to figure out inventory management as well as his level up system to complete events. Even though he can steamroll enemies, it's harder for him to save others or complete timed events without thinking ahead. That's more the meat of of the show, Satou thinking out his problems and coming to a solution that benefits everyone.I hope for another season, as honestly this was a pretty fun simulcast for me week to week. I'm not sure how a binge watch treats anyone, yet I found myself engaged in finding out more about the world and the characters. At the end of the day, that's all a moderately-good and average isekai needs. thus takes on the responsibility of all these slaves so they can live a better life.

There\'s nothing special about it, its probably the most cookie-cutter Isekai i\'ve ever seen.The entire story can be summed up in one sentence:""Main character gets transported into a fantasy world, gets overpowered, rescues girl, girl falls in love with him, main character defeats more monsters, end.""in order to make this review longer because MAL wont let me post anything shorter, here\'s my conclusion:Death March to Another World is a cookie-cutter Isekai with sub-par story, average art, and below average enjoyment overall.I would only recommend this if you couldn\'t find ANYTHING else to watch. ', 'I behold, Death March, one of the worst most blandest isekais out there here is why.First of all the story, a middle age programmer who is sick of his current life takes a nap one day and wakes up in a game. Pretty exciting right, but the story is horrible there is actually no plot which destroys it in the first place. And it is no fun just getting everything right as you join because a bug in the game. You should have to earn your way up to the top this anime would have been better if there was an actual plot instead...of getting everything you ever wanted at once. 3/10The sound was just average like other typical anime, opening was not special in any way. 4/10The art was also just like any other ordinary anime.

It never strays from a very predictable template.  It also feels incomplete, or like nothing ever goes anywhere.  Potentially interesting plot threads are dropped immediately.  Interesting nuggets of information that seem like they\'re foreshadowing future plot developments, such as an early mention that not paying to renew your entry papers will result in enslavement, are simply never mentioned or followed up on again.  It feels like it was...made with a 2nd cour or season in mind, like we\'re just getting to the end of the prologue at the end of the series.  Even the series\' central metaphor, the ""death march"" of the overworked main character\'s job in the real world, never goes anywhere.  You would expect that to maybe influence Satou\'s behavior in some way when he\'s reincarnated in the game world, but it does not.  His past life is almost never referenced at all in fact, other than some general knowledge of video games helping him to explore a dungeon at one point.  His background, his job, being overworked, none of it ultimately matters even a little bit.Plot wise, there really isn\'t much going on.  There are a few short, low stakes arcs, but it\'s more slice of life than not.  The hero is a nice guy, always does the right thing, and always easily defeats the villains by literally being almost 50 times more powerful than anyone else we see in the series, going by levels.  The harem romance, such as it is, doesn\'t really go anywhere like everything else in the show.  In this case, that\'s for the best, since the vast majority of Satou\'s harem is underage or at least looks like they are.  He thankfully displays no romantic interest towards any of these characters but the show itself can be quite creepy, often finding ways to show them nearly naked or coming up with excuses to have Satou kiss them for Plot Reasons (he has to transfer magic to them, you see).  Only Zena\'s interest is even mildly reciprocated by Satou, and that\'s fine, but there doesn\'t seem to be any point to the harem he attracts beyond it being an occasional excuse for the show to sexualize alarmingly young girls.The animation is also very bad at points.  The CGI horses and lizardmen look awful and the animation gets clunky at points.  Even the character designs are a bit mediocre.  Visually, it\'s just not up to the standard you\'d expect of modern anime.Despite all the negatives, it\'s a pretty easy watch, especially if you like isekais and don\'t mind the fact that this one is completely generic.  Some of the characters are good.  Tama and Pochi are cute and I liked Liza and Nana as well.  The characters are pretty shallow but there\'s nothing wrong with them.  You can breeze through the series pretty fast and it\'s not exactly boring, even though very little actually happens when you get right down to it.Still, there are many, many better isekais out there, you\'ll probably enjoy those more if you\'re considering watching this series.

They expect some kind of super action in the game world from a game maker. However ever since I watched the first episode I realized this is not why it was made. It was made to make people laugh. So if you're in for an anime like Konosuba, this is your jam :).The story setting is incredible. The main character is a game creator and gets trapped in a game with the boosts he just had implemented in another game. Having those boosts he gets about to about lv 300 and now can pretty...much do everything he wants.

The other thing that impressed me was how he was able to help the others and even change their character to some extent.I loved the anime it was so fun!

The main thing that makes it interesting is that it subverts common tropes in the industry. The art style isn\'t all that great, and I feel it\'s a bit lacking in scene direction, but if you\'ve been wanting a slice of life sightseeing anime in another world this could be exactly what you\'ve been waiting for.There\'s my review, I\'ll now spend the rest of this review explaining why what Hipster Critics are saying about the Anime is factually...incorrect.--The Harem Trope - #1 Point of Criticism where the Critics are Wrong--The Anime is widely criticized for having a Harem and I feel that many critics could not see past their preconceived ideas about what that meant. For example this Anime touches on issues like PTSD from rape, Statutory Rape being Rape regardless of circumstances, how Consent that isn\'t given freely can\'t be considered true Consent, and so on.The show is deliberately subversive of the Harem Trope, the circumstances of the Parallel World are misogynistic but the Main Character isn\'t and all of his traveling companions develop an entirely platonic relationship with him based on mutual respect, only two characters even have romantic designs on him and he only returns the interests of one.Starting at episode 3 it becomes clear that it\'s going in a different direction with it, and I feel that a lot of critics must have either not watched the Anime at all and are going entirely by youtube hipster reviews, or made up their minds about it so strongly before they watched it that they could not see past their preconceptions. The much talked about scene at the end wasn\'t in any way sexual, and wouldn\'t even be interpreted that way without the preconceived expectation for it to be.--Responding to other common factually wrong Criticisms--The Anime doesn\'t take place inside of a videogame. Critic after critic says it does, but the world the character finds himself in is a Parallel World and that becomes apparent to the MC as he explores it. The only thing from videogames is his interface, inventory, and mechanics that were carried over when he was pulled into the parallel world.The Meteor Spell was based on expendable items that were only meant to help new players through a beginner dungeon, not to be used on a whole army of Lizardmen in another world, anyone saying ""fix your game"" must have missed this point even though it was very clearly spelled out in the very first episode.How the Protagonist arrived in the Parallel World is explained. He was pulled in by a powerful being, likened to a goddess. This is explained during the Undead King arc.The Main Character is a lawful pacifist, he tries to resolve situations without violence if at all possible. That\'s why he doesn\'t go around playing judge jury and executioner like some critics feel he should.This isn\'t a Shonen anime, it deliberately skips the grind to focus on what it\'s trying to do. If we had to watch him level up from level one we may as well just watch any Shonen or SAO or something. The main sense of MC progression comes from the MC picking up new abilities and figuring out his inventory, but the main focus is on how the MC interprets the world and how characters in it interact.No OP is not automatically boring, there are plenty of Anime with OP MCs that are really interesting. But this IS NOT an Action Anime, and those saying an OP MC is making it boring for the standard reasons are both factually wrong about OP characters and are missing the point of the anime.

At first he thinks it's a dream (as most would), but then realizes it's not and tries to adjust to the new world. I think the problem most people have with this anime is the situation surrounding Lulu and Arisa when they're first introduced. While it is terrible, it's considered normal in the world of Death March. And thankfully, the main character is not like everyone else.Art (8/10) - The art style makes it easily recognizable as a fantasy...anime. The simple, base design is nice and endearing, not too hard on the eyes.Sound (7/10) - The opening theme gives a nice lively beat as it mixes Satou's previous life with his new one as he explores with his companions. The ending song echoes an air of a calm, relaxing tone by the female cast.Character (5/10) - Although he didn't start that way, Satou quickly becomes your average over-powered Isekai protagonist. He's also surrounded by an all-girl cast that likes him (more or less) that you'd generally find in a Harem anime.Enjoyment (7/10) -  Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody did have some competition during the Winter 2018 season as it aired alongside Overlord II. Regardless, it did have a nice, heartwarming journey for a programmer turned hero who's literally living the dream.Overall (6.8/10) - While I can understand people giving this show a low score for the issue surrounding Lulu and Arisa, I feel like that's all they have to hate. Despite Death March having average characters, a seemingly generic storyline, and 'terrible' art; I think a small part of the show is being too deeply dug for a light-hearted anime. anime.

It has flaws, sure, but find me an anime that doesn’t! It was part entertaining, part relaxing, and part awkward, but overall mostly enjoyable.It’s a lot less plot-heavy than your normal Isekai anime. Most of the season is just Satou wandering around the new world he finds himself in, getting to grips with how things work and making friends along the way. He doesn’t automatically stumble upon the main villain’s giant plot to destroy the world as we know it. He gets into a few fights helping people, but mostly he just takes things...as they come, day by day. That’s why this is probably known as a slice-of-life Isekai. Which is nice for a change.You might ask, if Satou is so overpowered why doesn’t he act differently in like…the majority of the situations? Why does he even bother trying to help people or getting into fights when he could easily kill any bad guy with a single strike, and make enough money to get absolutely anything he wants?It’s a fair question, and I think the answer is: he’s simply enjoying himself as he is now. He’s still figuring out this new world, and basically just taking a break from his exhausting previous life. As he is now, he’s free, and revealing his strength would automatically diminish his freedom. He also doesn’t realise just quite how OP he is, but it’s unlikely much would change even if he did realise that he’s miles above the strongest bosses.The world building, while not exactly original, is well-presented. There’s a lot of exposition, and great details of time can be spent on single meals or learning a new type of magic. There’re plenty of inner monologues too, but they tend to be on interesting topics or areas that prove necessary for the plot.I thought the art was amazing, but then again I’m just partial to that type of style. The animation was great, and the music was light-hearted and fit the series well.The harem. This is where the problem starts. So here’s the thing, Satou is actually a 30 year old guy in a 15 year old body. He has the mind and tastes of a 30-year-old, and he’s not interested in little kids or lolis. He picks up a lot (A LOT) of girls during his wanderings – saves their lives, rescues them from slaver or kidnappers, defeats them after being challenged to a fight, you name it – but he views himself as their guardian and is not interested in any of them sexually. That isn’t to say he’s celibate; he just goes elsewhere when he wants to party. A few of the girls (not the younger ones) seem to be in love with him, but it’s unlikely that will ever get anywhere. There is an awkward scene shortly after he rescues two of the girls from a slaver (which is understandable considering how they must have been previously treated), and another one near the end, but he sorts it out both times and moves on.That’s why it’s different to your normal harem. It’s not that Satou’s merely incredibly dense and doesn’t figure out their feelings, simply that he doesn’t return them. (I’m not sure if this applies in relation to the oldest of them – who at least is an adult - but it still seems unlikely.) He’s kind and gentle to everyone, teaches them how to read and fight, and basically just views them as his new family.There is a caveat; it feels like this takes a turn for the worse in the final episode. It’s almost like the creators realised that they had no weird moments in most of the anime, so tried to cram them all in at the end. I’d actually advise against watching the final half of the last ep, it’s a lot more cringey than the others and adds nothing to the story anyway.The other problem (and this is the result of having so many characters) is that none of the cast really gets much development. The only character who even gets a proper backstory is Arisa, and even that doesn’t have much time spent on it. As for Satou, I had no idea he actually died in his sleep until someone pointed it out to me – even though it happens in the first episode and is in the actual name of the blasted anime. I’d just thought until then that it was like Log Horizon where everyone just disappeared in front of their computers one day. That being said though, making him a game dev was a good idea. It makes his natural understanding of the game mechanics much more realistic, because it’s the sort of thing he himself created in his job. His OPness also made better sense that way too. So well done on that part.All in all, it’s just an anime to watch when you want to kill some time. It’s not deep, and not generally fast-paced, but it is quite light-hearted and relaxing. It has none of the heaviness of Grimgar or the horror/mystery of Re:Zero. It’s more like watching Konosuba but without all the crude and over-the-top humour. If that sort of light-hearted atmosphere is the type of thing you like, then this might be worth a watch. XD as they come, day by day. That’s why this is probably known as a slice-of-life Isekai.

If that sort of light-hearted atmosphere is the type of thing you like, then this might be worth a watch. XD', ""Deathmarch is Fantasy Game Isekai with so much mystery to unravel.

Thus i felt it was my duty to give a more nuanced and rational review of this anime.First off, I think there\'s clearly something here.  I read the manga adaptation way before this came out, and between that and the anime, there\'s magic in the simplicity of the story.  The protagonist is pretty tame and most of our supporting cast are 1 dimensionally characterized by single words like: ""child,"" ""dutiful,"" ""meek,"" or (sigh) ""horny,"" yet the characters come together...in something that really blends together as a family.   Hands down this is the best part of the show - the semi-subversion of what could have so easily been another mindless harem into a cute, loving adopted family.  Hell ya I\'m sold on watching a simple but consistent main character travel around a fantasy world adopting cute girls in need into his care and teaching them how to survive in a world filled with racism and greed.  And we get... a little bit of that.So lets get on to the issues.  I did not like the 7 anime episodes I have seen, and from what I know from alternate sources, the story gets worse.  So as I said there\'s quite a few cute characters that our MC basically adopts, however he adopts them so fast we have little to no time to actually get to know them.  As soon as we get a new set of faces, our old characters\' screen time is practically 0 - and hence we only have time for only the most basic of character development.  The main character is equally stale but doesn\'t even have this poor excuse.  Multiple times he encounters things that give him the opportunity for deep existential conflict as to: why he\'s here, who else is here, and the vicious nature of classism an racism, but our protagonist merely comments on it and drops the topic permanently within seconds.  Too bad we don\'t get to see internal conflict or question the setting - that would be too exciting.Speaking of which is our next issue - pacing and drama.  The story has little excitement and plays down what little it has.  The first episode has actual tension because the protagonist is concerned for his survival, but past that episode we will never be concerned again that any issue can trouble our hero.  At some point he faces off with a deific being, and never once will you hear him sound anything but calm and in control.  He\'s not even worried about his girls, because he\'s so completely sure he can protect them too.  There\'s so much room for drama and badassery here, but the execution is just as poor as the quality of the lackluster animation.Constantly, throughout this story you\'ll find the author falling into that age old trap of wish fulfillment - gutting the drama in lieu of a Main Character who feels calm, collected and in control at all times.  And that really could have worked, if instead of all this action nonsense they just focused on the strengths of the story - a cute family riding around discovering the world - but of course each arc is premised entirely around which damsel will be rescued and our would building and character building is stifled.Clearly the author wanted drama - constantly rescuing damsels demands drama, however the wish fulfillment formula demands no drama. Either can work, but the author amateurishly tried to merge these two concepts in the worst possible way.TLDR: Author found some magic but instead of exploring it, we get a pretty generic wish fulfillment series with particularly bad action sequences.The one thing i gotta say before this review ends is: Thank you satou for not being a pedophile. in something that really blends together as a family.

In my case and the second, I just want to appreciate the work that was created, even if there are millions of similar works already, without worrying about a specific characteristic. Sorry, I just wanted to get off to a more relaxed start when I talk about bad works, so...here we go.Death March is an isekai harem, with our powerful protagonist, and his group of girls, for their part minors, in a scenario where he is the hero. Its story is terrible as if it didn\'t have a starting point and a path to follow, it starts in a topic ala Demon King, goes to reincarnation, goes through elves and so on. She doesn\'t stop at any fixed theme, throwing the viewer from one side to the other without explaining anything. Another point of the story is how the protagonist Satou\'s harem is made, he is created without any logic, the girls just like him and that\'s it, without relationship development.Explained the plot, did you like it? calm that gets worse in these 12 episodes of the plot of the work, all we observe is an empty fantasy world, with nothing different and almost everything the same, nothing that happens in the work has an impact on the world, and giant events occur for the plot . This is so that we can buy the novel if we are interested, but please don\'t do that, it\'s not worth spending money on a work that doesn\'t take the trouble to show the minimum quality in its ""ad.""That said, let\'s go to the art of Death Marth, from the scenery to the action and everything is done in a mediocre way, not even giving a damn about continuing to watch the scenes, you just go on automatic to end it soon. His CG animations come across as terrible, effortlessly ugly. The Fan Service moments have an impeccable timing being the best I\'ve ever seen, that\'s a lie they are horrible being placed in the wrong ways with a high frequency.The characters are the biggest problem with this anime in my opinion. Starting with Satou, the super powerful Good Samaritan protagonist, he\'s not even that big of a problem, just being one solves giant problems in simple ways. Already his group composed of minors and a problem, especially in scenes of Fan Service. These scenes make the show a perfect place for lolicons, with moments that disgust viewers who don\'t like it.In general this show has nothing innovative, people who like a harem anime must find a quality in it, but nothing about it pleases me, from story, art, characters or the lolicon factor (thankfully). In the end, what made me see this work was its Brazilian dubbing, but I don\'t recommend it to any anime lover.Note: I apologize for any problems.

Not only is this unfinished it is pure bait to make you see what would have happened in the following episodes by reading the next part. I get that is often what shows advertise but you at least get some sort of a story that ends. The main mission of the latter half is literally nowhere near its conclusion.The main story doesn't really go anywhere in the first place let it be known. It is an Isekai...with a character that is overpowered fine. He tries to be all high and mighty about slavery but treats them differently regardless to others. He lets a bad guy live as do many a 'hero' and thus he continues to be bad. They help situations this time but allow the perpetrators to live thus meaning it can happen when he is not there.

To achieve this they have grown this nasty habit of over-explaining mechanisms how things work only for them to never be explored in detail or serve some other purpose than ""aaah look at what I can do now"".So, should you watch it... well I don\'t know.

Seriously, if this guy farts he would get a farting skill, it's that stupid and It feels like a parody. There's also no suspense because you know this guy is over powered...and he knows it. In other, better isekais, there are over powered characters also, but at least the main characters are interesting and have cool allies, enemies and goals, there's literally nothing going on with this guy.There's just no reason to watch this in a world where Shield Hero or Reincarnaited as a Slime exists. This Anime is like a rippoff Shield Hero with a garbage bargain bin Lizard girl and a copy pasted Shalltear slave girl that do nothing instead of the much better Raphtalia and Philo. Hell, he even has a cart like Shield hero.I mean this is still watchable but don't waste your time unless you already watched everything else and got nothing better to do. 5/10 and he knows it.

Instead of just being over powered because he can, the main character takes the time to learn the necessary skills to be the character he wants to be. The fact that he already has the skill points is immaterial because it's how he applies them and when that is the driving factor.2) How much I enjoyed...itThere were so many nuggets in this anime that made me enjoy it. The fact that he has a harem that he feels responsible for, so he hits up the local brothels to have a good time is hilarious to me.

The story of a computer programmer finding himself immersed in a new fantasy RPG, he decides to use his godly powers to help others and live a peaceful life (with his harem).1: Story Score -> 5 (Mediocre)Don\'t get me wrong. The story in Death March is decent, following the journey Satou takes to help protect the people of the village from despair. The problem lies in the unusual flow of story progression. Some bits fell out of place or unnecessary (filler-like)...given the circumstances that this is a 12 episode season.2: Art Score -> 7 (Good)I like to give credit where credit is due, and Death March does well with its good art elements that help boost its story. Especially in settings such as when the sun sets, those scenes really popped to me.3: Sound Score -> 5 (Mediocre)Not much impressing audio factors in this series. During the shortly lived battles Satou takes on, I didn\'t notice any ground breaking sound effects. The OP and ED are good, but nothing special.4: Character Score -> 6 (Fair)With a large cast of characters and a short length of 12 episodes, character development and screen-time will be limited, obviously. And this is where the statement ""Biting more than you can chew."" comes into play. With such a decently large amount of characters, it will be hard to include everybody and have some sort of impact on the story. I do respect that every character had a decent amount of screen-time (excluding Zena), but on the other hand perhaps this show should\'ve waited for more source material or something to make this season longer (24 episodes would be ideal).5: Enjoyment Score -> 4 (Decent)I really wanted to truly enjoy the nature of this show, but with this stereotypical blend of harem character development and a seamlessly indestructible MC with no problems, it just feels TOO much like a fantasy if that\'s even possible. Throughout the entire show I never felt on edge even a  little, since I knew Satou would have kicked butt all the way with no issues.

He's a good guy with good morals, but there's nothing really driving him.Despite having powers comparable to a god and beyond, he cares almost nothing for it and...puts in no real effort to utilize his skills for much anything aside from the completely mundane and arbitrary happenings.Other characters in the show are similarly devoid of much personality. So much so that they're written in as slaves to the MC, so that the writers don't even have to bother giving them a personality, as they have to do what the MC says and ask for permission for everything.The world they inhabit is also complete fantasy cliche and next to no effort is put into building it up.Death March just doesn't seem to have any reason for existing. Watching it gives you the feeling of watching filler episodes of an already mediocre anime. All it really has going for itself is standard quality art and sound, so you at least have some illusion of watching something worthwhile.It's a bit sad because the show has a decent enough of a foundation to work with. They just decided not to do anything with.

The use of money is used way to much, but there aren't any scenes showing us how that currency was obtained. The episodes basically lead to no where, and the characters are all very un-original.The art is well done, as is the sound and voice acting. But storyline and character development is needing much help. I personally would've liked a second season if it was more enjoyable, but as this review. It's not really.

Overall I would say this is so far (ep 5), the saltine cracker of isekai show. Its got everything that the genre is infamous for: Overpowered Dull Main portag, Harem of underage girls, and RPG terms/UI. The only real hook to this show is that the main character is actually a fully functional adult who helped program the game world he is now trapped in. Something im sure will inevitably turn into a twist that he died at the begining of the show and is now trapped in the gameworld as a form of heaven/hell.That being said, its an...enjoyable enough show (so far). Nothing is too offensive so far, its all just horribly bland, uninspired, and predictible. Its nothing of a show. I watch an episode and couldnt care less about what happens to anyone. Everyone is boring, the plot is basic, and the world isnt even properly explored (so far). With the twist on the genre being that this a slice of life isekai show. At which point I would rather promote Outbreak Company as an alternative, as that show at least has an itdentity and an intersting enough premise and a main character with more personality than my peanut butter sandwich. enjoyable enough show (so far).

I don't like to give a pre-judgment for the people who are gonna see this. So, I'll just highlight some things that caught my eye and you can judge them yourself. The animation in the 'real world' part of the anime seems unfit but really qualifies in the...'virtual world' part. The characters are all quite pleasant and lovable but the protagonist doesn't seem to have much life. He's not all dull but more like a wrong candidate to have been transported :P. But the overall story and presentation, although doesn't intensify or complicates, still provides something which is worthwhile to watch and think about. None of the episodes truly kills off the 'expectations' that you'll probably have and so the whole ride will not be breathtaking to most but almost satisfying to others. Won't suggest as a good one but spare it for your free, useless, lazy spent time. 'virtual world' part.

He just goes around without a care in the world, accumulating girls for his pseudo-harem.I find the notion of regular person transported into fantasy game world appealing.  I also think that having an over powered hero can be fun, as in One Punch Man, or Gate (where Japan's military is OP compared to other-world feudal military).  However, both OPM and Gate have a lot more depth and complexity.  In OPM, the hero's absurd power creates drama in terms of how'd he get it, what does...he do with it now, how does it affect his world-view.  Anyway, in Death March, there is none of that, just a god-like hero who walks around having fun surrounded by eye-candy.So, basically, this is the most vanilla of anime, but I guess sometimes vanilla can be nice, so I could see where this could be enjoyable for a few shows, but it gets old fast as you realize the writers have nothing more to offer, no plans to shake things up. he do with it now, how does it affect his world-view.

Stories like those are enjoyable and sell well, so I can\'t really say that it\'s a downside, but market oversaturation and people getting fed up with cliches can hurt it.Still, you can\'t make a story only from used parts, and Death March has some things that make it stand out from...crowd.One such quality would be adult protagonist. While Satou isn’t some daredevil badass, his not being dense (!) and keeping cool head in situations where MCs usually panic is really refreshing. I blame animation (facial emotions) and voice acting for making him seem much less interesting than he is.Other thing that makes Death March special is some focus on exploration of the world and its systems. It’s one of few isekai titles that actually show us protagonist trying to understand and test how his abilities work. It goes well in pair with Satou’s desire to enjoy this new world at his own pace, without becoming some great hero and gathering attention.Now, you could ask where things went wrong and what’s the reason behind this anime’s low score. I believe biggest flaw in this adaptation is too small focus on things I mentioned in previous paragraph. The adult and experienced protagonist, as I mentioned earlier, has been undermined by voice acting and animation. The exploration part, that could win over SoL crowd, was used more like a filler between “story” and action, instead of being the main driving force.The bad animation that I keep mentioning over and over again also hurt action scenes a lot. And I mean A LOT. They are truly pathetic and I don’t know why they even bothered with those.Another weak point of Death March are characters. While Satou is pretty good himself, vast majority of main and side characters are just bad. Personalities that can be summed up in one word and no development or backstories make even main cast feel like mob characters.So, what about enjoyment? As I said in the beginning, it’s very enjoyable anime. Even when Satou’s voice tried to put me to sleep and my eyes bleed from animation, I still had a lot of fun watching it.

You have been warned.Saving girls and Sightseeing in a fantasy world with Satoo and friendsBased off a popular light novel series of the same name of which im also a fan off Death march is a fantasy and adventure anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if rather than a teenager from the modern world would be trapped in a game that they...were playing that a game programmer in his mid-twenties would fall asleep after a death march and wake up in a world that looks very much like the game that he had designed. What will be cooler than that you ask. How about finding that you have not only been transported to a new world, but you have also somehow reverted back to how you looked when you were a teenager while still retaining all the memories of his older self. The first episode of the series did a great a job at both introducing the main character and the main setting that this new world that he been deposited in made use off and while slow at first made up for it by being relaxing and laid back.Taking place in a fantasy setting reminiscent of western medieval themed RPG’s is a world that is populated by all sorts of races and creatures each of which have their own views, cultures and customs. Here Humans are but one race but rather than exist in harmony with other races they instead treat them with suspicion and fear where even the slightest spark would cause scuffles to break out over prejudices and hatred that humans have towards beast folk. Outside of the walls of the cities is a large expansive world that while having varied terrain also features dangerous creatures like wyverns as well as curious races like the ratmen and the elves that do all they can to survive in a hostile world where both demons and magic exist. The overall story of the series follows the adventures of Ichirou Suzuki a 29-year-old programmer from the real world that after falling asleep after a long days work find’s himself in a unfamiliar world and his attempts to both find a way to unlock the mystery of both this world and find a way back while also taking the time to experience and explore this new yet seemingly familiar world that he had been dragged into. Joining him on this quest will be a host of characters that include the cunning but surprisingly kind Arisa, The caring and steadfast Liza and the brave and hardworking magic soldier Zena as they embark on a journey to solve the mysteries of this world while also having an enjoyable road trip that is filled with laughter, unique encounters and crazy new inventions that while common in the modern world are like something from a legend in this new world.Ichirou SuzukiIchirou Suzuki voiced by new voice actor Shun Horie of Juni Taisen fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. Initially a programmer from the real world that was in his late twenties that reverted to how he had looked when he was a teenager Suzuki who within the series takes on the moniker of Satoo is someone that can be said to be typical for someone his age in that while he works hard to accomplish the tasks that were assigned to him that will benefit him and his friends he doesn’t do it to gain fame but rather to ensure that he and his friends are able to benefit from it. Despite his tendency to avoid either causing trouble to others and causing trouble to come to him his actions almost always causes the letter to come to him causing no small number of headaches for him. A hardworking, kind and caring person by nature Satoo is someone that approaches each situation calmly and rationally always trying to be diplomatic and fair to all he encounters. While cautious to a degree Satoo is also someone that is both intelligent and fast thinking and able to come up with many ingenious solutions to problems that they encounter as he travels the world. While outwardly carefree and generous to all he encounters Satoo is someone that can be seen to be both dutiful towards his allies and understanding of the circumstances of others. He is also shown to be extremely perceptive easily able to determine when something is awry and thus allowing him to create countermeasures that will deal with them. In this Satoo is someone that while a good tactician and well versed at ordering others is also someone that also tries hard to see the bigger picture something that is important whichever world you are in. While wary of causing trouble to himself in the beginning Satoo is also someone that can be seen to have a strong sense of morality and in line with this Satoo is someone that dislikes seeing injustice of any kind take place in front of him and will actively try to help those in need even if this would cause trouble for him. This is best shown in his freeing of Liza, Tama and Pochi and his taking in of Arisa and Lulu into his party.As the series goes on and more of Satoo’s personality is revealed it can be seen that Satoo is someone that believes greatly in the elements of free choice and will not try to force people to obey him but merely explain to them what will happen if they do not listen something that goes well with his personality. While trying to avoid trouble and entanglements that will drag him down as the series progresses and Satoo adds more and more girls to his party this sense of trying to avoid responsibility for them gradually disappears and is replaced by a desire to keep his friends safe from harm a responsibility that Satoo is serious about. While someone that can be considered OP by the standards of the world’s inhabitants it can be seen that Satoo is someone that dislikes drawing attention to himself and works hard to hide the power that he has opting to instead to mask it behind his creative use of tactics and strategies when pressed into combat. While very basic for the most part Satoo’s use of tactics emphasises on the personality traits and developments that define him namely his desire to protect his friends and allies from harm while trying to minimise the number of casualties while simultaneously maxing out the success rate. While a creative strategist Satoo is also someone that is noted to be someone that’s also creative and makes use of this to craft various types of items that he uses to experiment with various subjects in his quest to both understand this new world and at the same time make their road trip that much more comfortable. An interesting aspect of the relationship that Satoo forges with his friends and fellow companions is the fact that its more akin to a family than a party which is especially apparent in his view of Tama and Pochi as his kids and Arisa and Mia jostling for the role of the main girl. This is an aspect that I particularly liked as it resonated well with the road trip theme. The character of Satoo I felt was an interesting character that had some good development as the series went on and I felt that his voice actor Shin Horie did a great job voicing him.ArisaArisa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Aoi Yuki of Youjo Senki and Rokka no Yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Satoo’s fellow travelling companions. An 11-year-old human girl that was formerly a slave Arisa is a girl that can be said to be someone that has a lot of guile for someone her age. A polite, intelligent and cunning young woman Arisa is also someone that was also fast thinking and maintained a positive attitude at all times even when subjected to abuse by others that she often retaliates with her sharp tongue. While haughty and somewhat self-confident on initial appearance as Arisa interacts with the rest of the party it can be seen that Arisa is someone that is not just responsible and loyal to her friends but also someone that is also kind and caring and willing to deal with problems before they affect them. While Arisa’s behaviour in the beginning was similar to her former station as a noble it can be seen that she displays attitudes that are atypical of nobles such as her desire to avoid seeing innocents get hurt as well as the lack of prejudices towards other races something that I really liked about her character. In line with this is Arisa’s ability to reduce even complex problems to very basic ones that can be understood by anyone showing her determination to help others understand to the fullest.In the beginning of the series Arisa was noted to have a fierce desire for Satoo as she fervently believed that they were meant to meet up. Despite the repeated rejections by Satoo Arisa’s advances on Satoo never ceases as the series goes on showing how determined she is with this endeavour. In line with this Arisa is shown to have great pride on the fact that she’s the self-proclaimed main girl within the group that she often rubs against her nearest rival Zena to the amusement of Satoo and the group. The character of Arisa I felt was an interesting character that despite her relatively young age is someone that is mature for her age and like Satoo is able to see the bigger picture of something. While one would expect that a former noble would still retain some of the arrogant nature that nobles usually have Arisa instead displays none of this being both kind and caring to others and not caring about the races that they belong too. While her position of the main girl within the party is a self-proclaimed one I felt that her kind and caring personality more than gives the right for her to be that role within the party. I felt that her seiyuu Aoi Yuuki really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Arisa.LizaLiza voiced by veteran seiyuu Minami Tsuda of Classroom Crisis and Guilty Crown fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Satoo’s fellow travelling companions. A member of the lizardkin demi-human race Liza in the beginning of the series was a kind, caring and calm person by nature that while remaining quiet tries hard to be a responsible leader to her fellow slaves by leading them and keeping them out of trouble. As a result of being a former slave in the beginning Liza was noted to be someone that was easily put off by the kindness that Satoo shows her and had a tendency to try to take responsibility for actions and as a result disliked her master doing things for her as she feels it should be the other way around. In line with this Liza was also noted to be someone that was obedient and loyal and always asked for permission before she did anything. As a result of this nature, she was noted to hide her true feelings on matters behind her mask of obedience. However, despite this, it can be seen that she is also someone that while risking her master's displeasure is also someone that’s not afraid of offering her own opinions on matters a fact that Satoo learns to appreciate as the series goes on. While initially very timid and obedient to her master as the series goes on and as she gets to know Satoo as a person better this nature of hers starts to disappear and Liza starts to more assertive and confident while learning to express her thoughts and questions more openly than before.ZenaZena voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Takahashi of Re Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Satoo’s friends that he makes after coming to this world. A 17-year-old minor noble Zena is a brave, considerate and hardworking person that tries hard in everything that she does whether in being an effective magic soldier for the military or in helping her friends. A polite and understanding person by nature Zena is also someone that believes greatly in righteousness and is someone that is always willing to defend the innocents from harm no matter the threat arrayed against her. While a noble Zena is shown to be someone that has none of the arrogance and prejudices that such people usually have as she treats people with care and respect no matter the race that they belong too. A prominent trait of Zena’s that stem from this is her determined efforts to not stand out from the others something that is the opposite of what a noble would do. This is something that I felt added charm to her character.As the series goes on it can be seen that Zena is someone that treats her duty to the city as well as to its inhabitants seriously and it is this that can be seen to be Zena’s main motivation for her life as a soldier. While someone in her late teens Zena is noted to be someone that gets nervous easily and is someone that tries hard to be of service to everyone that she meets whether or not they are from the city or not which is without a doubt her most prominent trait. Though seen far less than we see the rest of the cast I felt that Zena was a character that was well designed, and her character featured some good development. I felt that her seiyuu Rie Takahashi did an excellent job of portraying the character of Zena.AMVOverall the animation for the series I thought was done pretty well especially with regards to the various towns and locales that the cast visit as they really did look like something that would come from a medieval fantasy setting. The character designs for the series I thought were largely faithful to the source material which is the LN. Combat animations I thought were also fluid and the fights were well designed and developed. The outfits that were worn by the characters I felt were also well designed and helped in giving each character a unique look that worked well with their personalities to make each a unique existence within the story. In terms of music I thought that the series OST’s was one of the series strong points as it was not only appropriate to the scenes itself but also gave a somewhat relaxing and calming feeling to the viewer as they watched the cast go about their journey and as a result matching well with the sense that the anime is just a road trip with friends. This was also represented in the series opening and ending themes as well the former had the effect of drumming up excitement for the journey while the latter had the effect of a leisurely journey with friends. Voice acting for the series I thought was excellent with Arisa’s seiyuu Aoi Yuuki and Zena’s seiyuu Rie Takahashi deserving special praise for their portrayal of their respective characters.Overall conclusionOverall Death March was an interesting anime that while rather genetic in terms of this type of genre was still an anime that I really enjoyed watching this season with its main strong points being its interesting premise, story, characters, strong voice acting and its handling of OP characters as well as its look at more mature themes of society that we don’t readily see often. In terms of premise falling into a parallel world or being sucked into a game world is not really anything new as we have seen this plenty of times such as shown in well-known series such as Re Zero and Konosuba. However, what makes the premise for this series unique is that while the main characters for the after-mentioned series were teenagers the same is not repeated here as the mc here is someone that is both an adult and someone that is also employed as well. This helps greatly in eliminating traits that teenage neets bring to the story. As a result of the fact that the mc is an adult we also get the opportunity to see how he interacts with the members of his party which for the most part consist of children which had the effect of making them look more like a family than anything. This sense of treating the party as a family rather than as a normal party can be seen to be one of the central themes of the series something that I thought matched both the personality and theme of the series pretty well. As the mc in the series was formerly a programmer in the real world this added to the series a new sense of perspective that were unique to the mc as it allowed the mc to view challenges in this world as programming problems that can be solved easily if broken down into different parts and solved in sequence. In terms of world-building I thought that the series did an excellent job of creating a world that was reminiscent of the high class medieval fantasy world settings that were mostly associated with the west than the east. The various RPG elements in the series such as the thought operated menu and skill point activated skills while sounding complex were handled pretty well within the series and worked well with the blend of magic and swordplay that served as the series main setting. This was in turn reinforced by the sheer number of skills that were available within the series as well.  Unlike other series of this genre that are mostly aimed at teenagers as its target audience since the mc for this series was an adult this gave the series an opportunity to make use of more mature themes like slavery and discrimination themes that I thought only served to enhance both the series and the mc as the latter tried to overcome the various challenges that were faced as the party went about their journey in the world in a manner more suited to someone his age.Overall Death March was a series that I really enjoyed watching as rather than being a struggle to overcome a powerful threat that we have seen before the series as a whole felt more like an extended road trip with like minded friends and companions that the mc met along the way while relaxing and enjoying the scenery along the way. While the mc was still OP to a degree I thought that his determination to hide his true powers rather than flaunt it openly that others in his position would was a good thing and matched well with his personality. In terms of overall score, I would say that it would be an 7/10 as while the premise and story were enjoyable I felt that some of the scenes featured in the series were not executed that well and felt flat when compared to the other scenes in the series. were playing that a game programmer in his mid-twenties would fall asleep after a death march and wake up in a world that looks very much like the game that he had designed. What will be cooler than that you ask. How about finding that you have not only been transported to a new world, but you have also somehow reverted back to how you looked when you were a teenager while still retaining all the memories of his older self. The first episode of the series did a great a job at both introducing the main character and the main setting that this new world that he been deposited in made use off and while slow at first made up for it by being relaxing and laid back.Taking place in a fantasy setting reminiscent of western medieval themed RPG’s is a world that is populated by all sorts of races and creatures each of which have their own views, cultures and customs. Here Humans are but one race but rather than exist in harmony with other races they instead treat them with suspicion and fear where even the slightest spark would cause scuffles to break out over prejudices and hatred that humans have towards beast folk. Outside of the walls of the cities is a large expansive world that while having varied terrain also features dangerous creatures like wyverns as well as curious races like the ratmen and the elves that do all they can to survive in a hostile world where both demons and magic exist. The overall story of the series follows the adventures of Ichirou Suzuki a 29-year-old programmer from the real world that after falling asleep after a long days work find’s himself in a unfamiliar world and his attempts to both find a way to unlock the mystery of both this world and find a way back while also taking the time to experience and explore this new yet seemingly familiar world that he had been dragged into. Joining him on this quest will be a host of characters that include the cunning but surprisingly kind Arisa, The caring and steadfast Liza and the brave and hardworking magic soldier Zena as they embark on a journey to solve the mysteries of this world while also having an enjoyable road trip that is filled with laughter, unique encounters and crazy new inventions that while common in the modern world are like something from a legend in this new world.Ichirou SuzukiIchirou Suzuki voiced by new voice actor Shun Horie of Juni Taisen fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. Initially a programmer from the real world that was in his late twenties that reverted to how he had looked when he was a teenager Suzuki who within the series takes on the moniker of Satoo is someone that can be said to be typical for someone his age in that while he works hard to accomplish the tasks that were assigned to him that will benefit him and his friends he doesn’t do it to gain fame but rather to ensure that he and his friends are able to benefit from it. Despite his tendency to avoid either causing trouble to others and causing trouble to come to him his actions almost always causes the letter to come to him causing no small number of headaches for him. A hardworking, kind and caring person by nature Satoo is someone that approaches each situation calmly and rationally always trying to be diplomatic and fair to all he encounters. While cautious to a degree Satoo is also someone that is both intelligent and fast thinking and able to come up with many ingenious solutions to problems that they encounter as he travels the world. While outwardly carefree and generous to all he encounters Satoo is someone that can be seen to be both dutiful towards his allies and understanding of the circumstances of others. He is also shown to be extremely perceptive easily able to determine when something is awry and thus allowing him to create countermeasures that will deal with them. In this Satoo is someone that while a good tactician and well versed at ordering others is also someone that also tries hard to see the bigger picture something that is important whichever world you are in. While wary of causing trouble to himself in the beginning Satoo is also someone that can be seen to have a strong sense of morality and in line with this Satoo is someone that dislikes seeing injustice of any kind take place in front of him and will actively try to help those in need even if this would cause trouble for him. This is best shown in his freeing of Liza, Tama and Pochi and his taking in of Arisa and Lulu into his party.As the series goes on and more of Satoo’s personality is revealed it can be seen that Satoo is someone that believes greatly in the elements of free choice and will not try to force people to obey him but merely explain to them what will happen if they do not listen something that goes well with his personality. While trying to avoid trouble and entanglements that will drag him down as the series progresses and Satoo adds more and more girls to his party this sense of trying to avoid responsibility for them gradually disappears and is replaced by a desire to keep his friends safe from harm a responsibility that Satoo is serious about. While someone that can be considered OP by the standards of the world’s inhabitants it can be seen that Satoo is someone that dislikes drawing attention to himself and works hard to hide the power that he has opting to instead to mask it behind his creative use of tactics and strategies when pressed into combat. While very basic for the most part Satoo’s use of tactics emphasises on the personality traits and developments that define him namely his desire to protect his friends and allies from harm while trying to minimise the number of casualties while simultaneously maxing out the success rate. While a creative strategist Satoo is also someone that is noted to be someone that’s also creative and makes use of this to craft various types of items that he uses to experiment with various subjects in his quest to both understand this new world and at the same time make their road trip that much more comfortable. An interesting aspect of the relationship that Satoo forges with his friends and fellow companions is the fact that its more akin to a family than a party which is especially apparent in his view of Tama and Pochi as his kids and Arisa and Mia jostling for the role of the main girl. This is an aspect that I particularly liked as it resonated well with the road trip theme. The character of Satoo I felt was an interesting character that had some good development as the series went on and I felt that his voice actor Shin Horie did a great job voicing him.ArisaArisa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Aoi Yuki of Youjo Senki and Rokka no Yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Satoo’s fellow travelling companions.

This, to be honest is such a great start to make us—the viewer a sense of humanity or at least Satou’s reasoning later in the story.Other Isekai adaptation tends to start with the protagonist already in another world, or sometimes near the teleportation so we don’t actually bother his real live. This, is...what I believed as the main foundation of the genre, which is an escape for developing audience from high-school to much complicated part of life such as college life, or work. Most of the times, it’s heavily implied that the audience is one of them so they don’t need this kind of prologue, which can be done as an advantage of the series, but most of the time I would call it, lazy production, and lazy writer.Even if we are either a college student or a worker, we don’t need for a series to passively told us that. What we need is a a glimpse of the main protagonist’s life so that we can relate more to him.Death March starts strong with Satou as a game developer that needs to work overtime for days, which can be seen as slave for the company. Heck, even Satou himself said it, and we can see that he don’t want to search for a lover because of it. This is a usual thing in Japan, which us as outsider probably cant relate to, but for me, I haven’t got this relatable Isekai series since Re:Zero, that is a fucking 2 year ago, so that tells much.Satou then wake up to find himself in a deserted land with UI that follows his face movement BUT DO NOT NEED TO BE TOUCH BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE. But really, this is already 10 points ahead of any SAO UI. He then, like probably every new JRPG gamers, start to uses his skills, levels up, and move around the map.Satou then safe a girl—ahem. I mean BEST GIRL. Walking around town with… Date with BEST GIRL. Free some slaves. Level them up in dungeon. Clear the Dungeon, Buy some more slaves, walk around town again, and solve some more problems along the way.We know that Satou—Satu, wtf ill go with Satou. Satou is a former slave-like employee to his company. It’s natural for him to mostly just walk around to enjoy life, even if he still hardly belief that this is his new reality.If I must say, Death March is dumb, in a good way, we can see much make sense detail such the UI, levelling up the slave, the need of title to use some weapon, just these ground-base MMORPG logic and system, that actually shows how much the writer think for the series.Probably it’s just small things and you prefer over-arcing heavy story which is fine. All that I can say is that every Isekai will most likely suffer things such as: Devil King, How to get back, or just some waifu wars. I can say that Death March suffer over arcing story heavily, and the chance of going to have multiple wives, but all of it is in the LN, so it’s kinda solve to some extent. Even if harem is the canon thing, at least she is the first one. He-em.Having said that, Death March is a series that’s build from the foundation, the first floor, and so on. Probably this kind of approach is old for many people, but I must say I kinda weak for this kind of thing. Because, as an audience, we are developing both with the story and the writer.Adding real quick for the animation, I know that it’s fit to the series IF, it’s only a slice of life story. When battle scene kicks in, it just doesn’t feel good enough. It’s lack of fluidity on character movements, consistency of the characters’s body proportion, and the obvious one is the lack of fps. The opening feels kinda cheap, like any other isekai-action-harem formula, but I admit that the ending feels just fit to the series tone.In the end, as far as the anime goes is a very basic start of a story, and it’s a light-toned ones. Having this kinda life in Another World is what I believed as most of us would do, kinda naïve, but acts smart, and just let it flow. Probably you’re making a harem in your way, probably you become a hero in your way, heck probably you slept in a love hotel, and purpose one of your noble girl friend in your way, then what’s happen just happened, that’s life, and I guess that’s also a life in another world.Answering the title of this video, I don’t think that Death March is a 6.88 anime, I personally will give this show a solid 8/10. 7/10 is what I wanted to give but hey, I enjoyed it much more than what I expected so there you go. what I believed as the main foundation of the genre, which is an escape for developing audience from high-school to much complicated part of life such as college life, or work.

The plot is a bit empty, And this is going to end up as an ""op main character"" anime.Story:Personally I don\'t really like animes with an op main character, but everyone has their opinions.As for what really bothers me, Is how fast, Liza, Tama, and Pochi level up.The leveling system make no sense to me, because there is no indicator to how much xp they gain. They just suddenly hit level...4 or whatever.Also, the soldier level is way too low, they\'ve spent hours, maybe even years, and some of them are still level 7 (+/-).The story gets a 5/10.Art:There is nothing really to say about the art. It is a bit weird from time to time, but It looks great.7/10 on art from me.Sound:It\'s good?I don\'t really look much into the sound, but It kinda hurt my ears for some reason.A 6/10 from me.Character:We get a tiny bit of backstory on the main protagonist, then he just turns into a badass and wrecks everything.He gets loot from a ""bug"" and maxes all skills/traits.5/10 because I don\'t like op characters with little to no background story.Enjoyment:No.Overall:The story is a bit hollow, but I am able to live with it.The main character\'s emotions seems a bit off. He doesn\'t react the way a person would do.6/10 4 or whatever.Also, the soldier level is way too low, they\'ve spent hours, maybe even years, and some of them are still level 7 (+/-).The story gets a 5/10.Art:There is nothing really to say about the art.

Read at your own risk.*Death march is an isekai that is heavy harem focused and loli obsessed.Style is ok, but is not refined.Plot-wise is simple. It focuses around a main character who is overpowered and tries to do good things around him, while being accompanied by a loli army. There is no main conflict and the romance is forced. The plot I consider to be a walk in the park style, meaning you take part of an adventure of a main character that does small quests along his travels. There is no major conflict. There is no drama, no...tragedy. And maybe that's what it makes its brilliance.I recommend this if you want to follow light story, that won't stress you with a hard thought plot and so on. tragedy. And maybe that's what it makes its brilliance.I recommend this if you want to follow light story, that won't stress you with a hard thought plot and so on."", 'It\'s a BIT better than Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. but that isn\'t saying much...Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku is our dime a dozen isekai shows that has almost no tension with a bland main male protagonist who procures a harem *cough* NPC slaves *cough* and is utterly OP as hell...so yeah the comparison to Isekai wa Samrtphone to Tomo ni. is rather apt here.LA does feel like to give Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku ""some"" praise...in comparison to Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. at least. Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku ""tries"" and LA says as loosely as possible...that our main male protagonist Ichirou Suzuki aka. Satou some tension in some of the rare amount of fights he does and actually goes through dungeons not as quickly as possible but taking ""some"" time in the dungeoneering (like spanned over 2 episodes, the fastest being about half an episode...LA thinks) and the game aspect to it in comparison to Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. where it takes from a minute to 5 minutes worth. Next would be that the slice of life moments is ""ok"" as it\'s just the main cast going through ""daily quests"" as slowly as possible in an isekai game that\'s THIS immersive and really all they do is fluff around in this game world to fill in the time, ""world building"" is fine and uhhh there\'s gonna be some flaws LA is gonna get into that REALLY pissed LA off. The harem actually does help a bit towards Satou with either their magical or physical combat or to the game aspects to themselves but uhhh again LA will get back to that that too. Really Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku has some restraint in comparison to Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. but like LA said at the start of this review...that\'s not praiseworthy enough.So about those flaws LA said in those small praises LA said about Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku, let\'s start with the tension of  Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku, the tension Satou brings  is still dull and boring as it\'s a forgone conclusion due to Satou\'s ""accidental"" power leveled status he has at the start of the anime and at the bulk of the anime where he can essentially MASTER any kind of skill as he\'s got the skill points to do it at his level thus becomes a master at EVERYTHING by the end of the series. He\'s restrained in his powers but still overpowered to all hell that even though the length the threat or tension is MUCH longer than Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. but ""a bit"" doesn\'t cut it SERIOUSLY. So those slice of life moments are decent at best if it concerns world building however because of how ""immersive"" Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku\'s game world is LA has to question how ""immersive"" it is in the first place, the major annoyance to this ""immersion"" is the various amounts of skills that can be acquired in the game, like Satou learns and acquires the most mundane to simplest skills that allows him to function as a game character it\'s crazy, even to the point of learning ""poker face"", like what?. LA KNOWS that at the start of the anime that before Satou gets transported to Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku\'s world that the game he\'s in is filled with glitches and this ""might"" be spawned from it however even THIS detail is just hurriedly glazed over and forgotten about that this is suppose to be a game with glitches in it and the glitches themselves is probably how Satou gained those levels in the first place AND ONLY THAT. Also as much as Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku is trying to be immersive by having an in-game HUD, the menu\'s gets annoying FAST especially when Satou learns and acquires skills and titles, it easily takes us out of the experience to repeatedly knock you on the head and say ""IT\'S A GAME, IT\'S A GAME!!!...MENUS!!!"". Satou\'s harem, well technically excluding Tama and Pochi are in Satou\'s harem however in the romantic sense, they are just for comedic fanservice set pieces, nothing more and they don\'t progress their relationship, the exception to that being Zena Marientail voiced by Rie Takahashi and guess what she\'s not in for HALF of the anime itself. Liza, Nana and Arisa are combat-reliant (Liza physical, Arisa magical and Nana probably in both but we don\'t really see her in combat after being in Satou\'s party) while Lulu and Mia are tag alongs (Lulu hardly gets development while Mia gets a small mini arc to herself!, screentime in this ""harem"" is unbalanced as hell). Well LA feels like for the most part that the combat of most of the harem is ""almost"" useless all due to...yeah Satou and him being overpowered be it in combat or outside it (no thanks to him learning any and ALL skills whenever he can).LA gets it that this like Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. and now Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku is like a power fantasy and giving us not much tension is ""relaxing"" but these kind of isekai subgenre\'s should realize that there needs to be more than ""just relaxing"" or a typical power fantasy we\'ve been seeing time and again to the point LA didn\'t care about ANY of these characters by the end of it, for a power fantasy it compensates for dull material and almost no tension, and ""just relaxing"" for something that\'s already becoming cliched to all hell. If our main protagonist has NO conflict or tension or weakness AT ALL, any type of threat or conflict is meaningless and we learn NOTHING from our main male protagonist and he doesn\'t grow as a character as he pretty much has no weakness to speak of and no just because Satou himself takes his time with his conflict in comparison to Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. isn\'t enough to change that...it just draws everything to a crawl to the foregone conclusion. As for the harem aspect, well this is the least focused and almost useless part to it, as due to Satou being overpowered in all aspects of the game, it\'s almost like Satou can just take any threat be it combat-heavy or the mundane. The harem in Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku is ONLY used for comedic and fanservicey aspects...THAT\'S IT.Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku\'s animation done by Silver Link and Connect....just ohh my god what happened?. LA says this as they did the same animation for Strike the Blood series and that looks polished as hell, but Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku just looks muddy especially the backgrounds. The character designs are decent enough but even they kinda blend in with each other AND the background. The battles though rare are ""meh"" at best and ""boring"" at worst as it has no fluidity to the battle motions and it just finishes as fast as it begins. Silver Link and Connect, Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku just might be one your most lackluster productions LA has seen from you...like what the hell and LA says this as just because your animating an isekai show that\'s a dime a dozen in the anime landscape by now in Winter of 2018, that doesn\'t mean you can slack off like this, LA hasn\'t been this off put from an animation style in quite a while.The voice acting....ohh Aoi Yuuki AND Rie Takahashi you\'ve been wasted on this anime. The voice acting was ""meh"" and though LA could see that most of the voice actors were having quote unquote ""fun"", LA just felt for the most part, the voice actors were on autopilot, Aoi Yuuki doing her perverse scthick, Rie Takahashi\'s typical vocals to Airi Eino who voiced Mia doing a typical kuudere and probably the easiest voice actor in their role of Kiyono Yasuno as the deadpan Nana. The only voice actors that LA felt were doing some kind of uniqueness to it were....Tama and Pochi\'s voice actors (Kaya Okuno and Hiyori Kouno respectively) and that\'s only because of their certain moe cadence that they NEEDED to it for these characters. Autopilot is the best LA will say about this voice cast.Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku as a whole, it\'s a bit better than Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. because it has some restraint in keeping the main protagonist\'s OP powers somewhat in check but that comes in with it\'s own plethora of problems, from an almost useless harem besides it\'s slice of life comedic fanservicey moments, the slice of life moments being dull and dragged out and though the tension is there from time to time, that too is gets dragged out and like Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. LA didn\'t get invested in the world or it\'s characters even though Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyousoukyoku at least ""tries"" to be immersive in it\'s game aspect, only for one of it\'s elements to annoy the crap out of LA by the end of it and it\'s characters are bland, stock or our main protagonist at the end of the day is overpowered with no weakness and if he DOES have a weakness he has the probably millions of skill points or exploit of the game itself to REMOVE THAT.""Death March"" is right, marching straight to LA\'s boredom... that our main male protagonist Ichirou Suzuki aka.

I\'ve seen the reviews and wondered why they gave the show so low.The anime\'s pace is very relaxed, from its character building to world building. Its a slice of life anime, with actions here and there. The main character is OP, but does not show his OPness, and is not too broken of a cheat (except the first episode). MC is very smart, and handles everything calmly.There is no real ""villain"" in the anime as of yet, its slice of life. The mc enjoys travelling, met with some problems here...and there, and easily solved them properly. There\'s also an episode that shows how OP the mc is, very nice haha as it made me hooked!The show also hinted at the mc\'s past, on how he met a mysterious little girl who, as the anime reaches its final episode, hints at a young goddess.And the soundtrack they used, oh my god. This is second to only overlord, where the soundtrack is absolutely spot on. The soundtrack made me feel as if im in the anime, in the fantasy world, there moments of upbeat and happy soundtrack, moments of mysteriousness, of holiness, of godhood, of sadness, of calmness, of warmth. I really loved the episode where the young elf princess blessed her deceased vassals.I really hope my intentions and feelings are portrayed in the writing I wrote, and I hope you can feel what I felt too. How we all wish we could be in a fantasy world. Bless you creator, looking forward for the second season.

Despite this we have adorable character designs, and the girls tend to have better than one-dimesional personalities as we usually see, at the very least they aren't cookie cutter. The sound and art are solid enough, there are no real issues and combat scenes are animated fully, no still-clash...or corner cutting making the overall quality of this anime better. The Voice acting is  solid with no feeling of out of place. OP and ED are upbeat and pleasant.Overall, I enjoyed this anime a fair amount, I don't expect much out of it, and it is good to pass the time. Also writing this sorted out what I thought so more power to me.Bottom line:There is no deep plot so far that has edged in throughout the episodes aired, some mentions but way too subtle. The entire Isekai genre has self-insert bland MCs this one is no exception. We have cute character designs, and decent world building, as for the harem building it isn't idiotic level where the girls lose IQ (except maybe Arisa) after falling in love actually I doubt we have reached harem state but that's debatable depending on whether having girl around means harem or if affection means harem member. My advice for this show is to watch this if you need to calm down, you have no tension in this anime at all excluding maybe first 10 minutes of the first episode, the character is so OP you just doubt that anything bad can happen. or corner cutting making the overall quality of this anime better.

Watching this show felt more tedious with each passing week, so I dropped them and it\'s only 1 year later that I decided to finish it, this time in English. That said, was it good? Well, let\'s hop on and find out!Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryWith the premise of an overpowered, supremely benevolent protagonist that rights whatever wrongs he comes across in a parallel world and earns a harem of beautiful ladies, Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody isn\'t really any different from countless...other isekai shows that are released in almost every anime season. Still, Death March is deceptively good thanks to its quirky and colorful atmosphere, relative lack of conflict and positive messages.The story of Death March takes place in a generic fantasy world, not really any different from what you would see in an RPG, something that protagonist Satou observes faiirly often. There are elves, dragons, magic, spirits, demons, etc, but the show lacks the proper amount of world-building to develop these concepts, which is to be expected given the 12-episode length.The aforementioned lack of conflict comes from Satou\'s creative application of magic and superpowers. While there is violence, it never becomes obscene and Satou and his companions manage to solve the problem before things really get messy.

Still, Death March is deceptively good thanks to its quirky and colorful atmosphere, relative lack of conflict and positive messages.The story of Death March takes place in a generic fantasy world, not really any different from what you would see in an RPG, something that protagonist Satou observes faiirly often. There are elves, dragons, magic, spirits, demons, etc, but the show lacks the proper amount of world-building to develop these concepts, which is to be expected given the 12-episode length.The aforementioned lack of conflict comes from Satou\'s creative application of magic and superpowers. While there is violence, it never becomes obscene and Satou and his companions manage to solve the problem before things really get messy.

It is pretty average as far as Isekai-themed anime goes. And here is why the first episode tries to build in some random slice of life which typically most titles tend to do and then suddenly the protagonist is warped or transferred into a different dimension. We have seen many of its kind and every one of them felt weird or simply out of place.If that was the direction the author intended, they should have started from a...fantasy narrative at the get-go instead of a round-about method to avoid the simple intricacies of world-building and proper character developments. But enough with the negatives, let us discuss what makes Death March worthy of your time.The narrative isn't anything amazing but it works, the slow pace and easy-going environment certainly deviate from most titles offered but it is suitable in this particular narrative. The art is not fantastic but that is not the main highlight, what really carried this anime was simply the overly-cute characters in them. The cute theme is very dominant in the narrative as it always revolves around the MC's companions. These are the main highlights to attract the attention of potential viewers or at least retain some of its existing ones.The musical score used is not very obvious, in fact, it is easily dismissed. In terms of the Op and Ed, I wouldn't say that they left an impression either. It is pretty meh.That being said, I actually enjoyed Death March mainly because of its characters. (You actually have Aoi Yuki stating the obvious Moe-ness) Although the characters are cute, there are some quality scenes with a decent amount of comedy. In an anime that isn't focused on fighting one can only focus on character interactions and the occasional situational response.Death March does not have many annoying characters maybe a few, but almost every main character does help to make the story a little more entertaining and enjoyable. When placed in a totally unknown and ambiguous situation, we cannot expect to suddenly get a grasp of what is happening and this anime certainly does not use the likes of time skips to make the MC learn about the world or any nonsense relating to that. Like the audience, the protagonist is learning as well, which is a huge plus in terms of being realistic and shows good character writing. Additionally, his companions are not totally useless there are times where they actually contribute meaningfully which is actually really impressive given that most anime tend to rely on just the MC.Although the voice acting could use more inspiration, it was still pretty decent.

It's also largely regarded as a pretty bad example of such with it generally being described as dull and generic wish fulfillment. I'm of a pretty different opinion however. I think that this anime does something pretty differently from most isekai and does it pretty well. Most isekai are wish fulfillment. I don't think that that's particularly a bad thing, and think...that if it does a good job of that I consider the anime good. This wish fulfillment usually involves being the hero of another world, using extraordinary powers to stand out and defeat great evils in epic battles while dealing with various drama, and to be respected and loved in return.While Death March is very much wish fulfillment, I feel that its fulfilling a very different wish from the standard isekai. While the protagonist does gain extraordinary powers, the purpose of these powers aren't to make him some great savior, but rather just to make it possible for him to not have to worry about anything too much, not for fighting epic battles and gaining recognition or anything like that. I think the core of his wish can be traced back to the opening of what he was doing before he came to another world and how he ended up going to another world in the first place. He was basically working himself to death to the point of going without basic human necessities like sleep, which he comes to adore. While it isn't made clear how he ends up in another world, the transition isn't induced by one of the exciting situations where he gets hit by a truck, possibly while saving someone else. Rather, he simply falls asleep after working too hard and wakes up in another world.With all that as the starting point, the protagonist really doesn't feel like the type of character to wish to be a hero that saves the world or anything like that, rather he simply seems like a character that wants to relax. And the world he gets sent to and the powers he's given simply let him do that. There's no major overarching plot regarding something he has to do. There's no particular enemy he has to be wary of. And hence, he can simply journey through the world enjoying it. I think the anime does a really good job of capturing that. Sure there's action and serious moments for characters, but they're just part of the journey and not what define it. There are battles yes, but they're just as important as the food scenes, and both are there in about equal amounts. There's also not really any character development, as no one really encounters situations powerful enough to really cause any major change in the cast. Rather, everyone is just going with the flow in a laid back manner for the most part. How likable said characters are will vary based on personal taste, but I found them amusing and likable enough considering the overall context of the anime. The heroines aren't supposed to be deep characters the protagonist develops interesting relationships with. Rather, his relationships with them are incredibly shallow and more guardian like than romantic. Hence, rather than a typical harem, it's more just a group of people enjoying a journey while the majority of them are cute. There is also is a good amount of humor, but overall the anime isn't really a comedy either. All of this does result in an anime that is incredibly slow, and I'm often one to complain about the pacing of anime whether they be too slow or too fast, but here I felt the pacing was perfect for what it was trying to do, be comfy and amusing. And from that point of view I found the anime greatly enjoyable.With that said, the art and animation weren't very good and the use of CG and a lot of the post processing effects were simply terrible. I did like the use of game like UI elements and popups though. The OP and ED were both solid, but of especial note is that I thought they fit the anime incredibly well. Similarly, the soundtrack too was really good and worked very well with the tone and atmosphere. that if it does a good job of that I consider the anime good.

I have so much crap to give this show and yet I give it a score of 7/10. You see, Death March is one of those trash shows that I immensely enjoyed watching. Despite its many, many flaws, I can\'t help but like it! It\'s so entertainingly bad and cliche that it\'s good!Overpowered MC:Kirito-- I mean Satou, our main protagonist, is as interesting as a piece of cardboard. Seriously, this guy has no personality except for being the ""kind and noble master"". Yup, he\'s Kirito 2.0 alright: just another average, run-of-the-mill guy who happens to possess...literally every skill in the book, can beat just about any monster without breaking a sweat, gets all the ladies wherever he goes, and will always save the day just like the white knight he is! Even his and Kirito\'s character designs look identical-- from the Justin Bieber haircut down to clothes they\'re wearing!Similar to Kirito, this guy is so overpowered that nothing phases him. There is hardly any sort of excitement in the action sequences because we know Satou is never in any kind of imminent danger. Since he is apparently the most high-level player in this whole entire world, he is inherently unbeatable. Even the biggest opponent he had to face down seemed like a mere noob compared to him! I mean, are you seriously saying I should feel scared for Satou when the big bad guy was made out to be all threatening and shit, yet he\'s barely half of Satou\'s player level?! AND that their ""epic"" showdown lasted less than 3 minutes with Satou fighting like it was child\'s play?Adding to that, there wasn\'t a single character that even came close to his power! Where\'s the challenge? The struggle? Why should I root for a character that I know will already win?Moreover, Satou is a very static character. I mentioned that he was boring, but even boring people can have interesting character development. Yet, Satou remains like a lifeless rag doll throughout the series without ever changing even when thrust in a world with different cultures, laws, ethics, and people. He just goes along with everything, does his classic close-eyed shrug, and acts passive as fuck-- oh except when he has to eventually save the day because of course he does. This guy doesn\'t even question why he was brought to this fantasy world! Satou just meanders aimlessly around (much like the plot) and stays the same. There was no character growth whatsoever-- NADA, nothing!Worldbuilding:Also, because of Satou\'s blatant lack of curiosity, there was never any chance at worldbuilding. We never get any sort of answers or explanations regarding this world. What are the laws here? The culture? Sure certain shots of the scenery looked beautiful but we never got any substance from them-- probably because Kirito 2.0 never asked any questions! We go on these mini-adventures to different places but they\'re so forgettable because they\'re all the same! People act the same, they wear the same clothes, even the architecture (as pretty as it is) is the same!I mean, I understand not wanting to info dump the viewer with all the technicalities of the world and sometimes things are better left to the imagination, but come on, can we at least get some basic answers on the functionalities of this world? And what happens if Satou dies in this world? Oh wait, we don\'t even get this critical question answered because there wasn\'t even a chance to explore it because SATOU IS BASICALLY A GOD IN THIS WORLD. He\'s practically immortal at this point: he\'s so damn powerful that there wasn\'t even an instance where he was under threat of death so we don\'t even get to consider that possibility.And what about magic? Is it a skill that anyone can acquire or is it only through genetics or only a certain race of people have it? Is it a mix of elemental magic and alchemy? Why does it seem like no one other than Satou uses magic? Even so, his powers were simply given to him at the beginning without any explanation to how he got them-- so is it a glitch in the system or is it just that easy to do, which then why aren\'t more people using magic or leveling up? Also, exactly how does one level up? Is it through killing monsters, or doing magic, or getting certain objects, or all of the above? Why aren\'t the military soldiers higher levels then? There were no specific requirements shown/ elaborated upon. Simply put: everyone is a noob while Satou just acquires power after power; our soft boi getting everything handed to him without a reason to any of it.Harem / side characters:Why are there no guys in this world other than Satou that aren\'t total douche bags or old? The only characters Satou meets along the way are pretty girls! And he takes them all in AND showers them with luxuries (sugar daddy, much?). His harem gets so big that by the end of the show he acquires over 20+ girls. Bruh. That\'s overdoing BIG TIME.Although, if we ignored the excessive harem aspect and focused solely on the female characters, they\'re actually really likable. Not a lot of depth or complexity but were you honestly expecting that from an isekai anime? Nah. But the girls are cute and funny and serve their purposes for comedic relief (which is most of the anime). The girls fall into pretty stereotypical roles but remain memorable nonetheless. Not many complaints here.Animation and Sound:I will this anime this: the animation was such a treat. Visually speaking alone, I would go as far as to give this show a 10/10. The bright and lively color schemes, with how crisp everything looked, the epic wide shots of the scenery, and the ""moe"" designs on the girls completely won me over. It was so stunning to look at!So while the animation blew me over, the soundtrack is pretty mediocre. I think the op was epic but that\'s pretty much it (and I think that had mostly to do with the cool animation sequence that they used and not much the music). The remaining ost like most of the background music was unremarkable and forgettable. The end credit song was okay, but again, nothing distinctive.Plot:As for the plot, WHAT PLOT. There is no plot! The final episode was so anticlimactic because nothing actually happens! I thought there would\'ve been at least some big finale to get me hyped for the possibility of a second season-- maybe for the ultimate villain to suddenly appear or for more intrigue and mystery to peak my interest in the world. Alas, that did NOT happen. Instead, Satou and his harem solve a problem that wasn\'t that hard to begin with (just like any other episode)!Although, maybe because of the lack of a plot, it explained why the pacing wasn\'t so bad? Better than Sword Art Online\'s, that\'s for sure. The narrative pacing is consistent throughout without any atrocious time skips or POV switching-- I actually think the pacing is one the strongest elements of the show and a key factor in my enjoyment. I was immersed in the world (enough, anyway) without having those previous pacing flaws sabotage my viewing experience.Final Thoughts:Alright, so after roasting the hell out of this anime, does Death March still deserve my score of 7/10? Well, no, but actually yes. Sure, there\'s the bullshit overpowered MC, lack of worldbuilding, and nonexistent plot, to damper the show\'s quality, but at the same time, Death March was addicting as hell with great animation and lovable side characters. I kept hitting the ""next episode"" button because I wanted to see more of the stunning scenery (like the Forest of Illusions) and the fawn over the adorable character designs (I have a soft spot for ""moe"", ok?), but most of all, I just wanted to get a good laugh because I was genuinely having a good time poking fun at this show! It\'s a trash show, but good trash, ya know...? literally every skill in the book, can beat just about any monster without breaking a sweat, gets all the ladies wherever he goes, and will always save the day just like the white knight he is! Even his and Kirito\'s character designs look identical-- from the Justin Bieber haircut down to clothes they\'re wearing!Similar to Kirito, this guy is so overpowered that nothing phases him. There is hardly any sort of excitement in the action sequences because we know Satou is never in any kind of imminent danger. Since he is apparently the most high-level player in this whole entire world, he is inherently unbeatable. Even the biggest opponent he had to face down seemed like a mere noob compared to him! I mean, are you seriously saying I should feel scared for Satou when the big bad guy was made out to be all threatening and shit, yet he\'s barely half of Satou\'s player level?! AND that their ""epic"" showdown lasted less than 3 minutes with Satou fighting like it was child\'s play?Adding to that, there wasn\'t a single character that even came close to his power! Where\'s the challenge? The struggle? Why should I root for a character that I know will already win?Moreover, Satou is a very static character. I mentioned that he was boring, but even boring people can have interesting character development. Yet, Satou remains like a lifeless rag doll throughout the series without ever changing even when thrust in a world with different cultures, laws, ethics, and people. He just goes along with everything, does his classic close-eyed shrug, and acts passive as fuck-- oh except when he has to eventually save the day because of course he does. This guy doesn\'t even question why he was brought to this fantasy world! Satou just meanders aimlessly around (much like the plot) and stays the same. There was no character growth whatsoever-- NADA, nothing!Worldbuilding:Also, because of Satou\'s blatant lack of curiosity, there was never any chance at worldbuilding. We never get any sort of answers or explanations regarding this world. What are the laws here? The culture? Sure certain shots of the scenery looked beautiful but we never got any substance from them-- probably because Kirito 2.0 never asked any questions! We go on these mini-adventures to different places but they\'re so forgettable because they\'re all the same! People act the same, they wear the same clothes, even the architecture (as pretty as it is) is the same!I mean, I understand not wanting to info dump the viewer with all the technicalities of the world and sometimes things are better left to the imagination, but come on, can we at least get some basic answers on the functionalities of this world? And what happens if Satou dies in this world? Oh wait, we don\'t even get this critical question answered because there wasn\'t even a chance to explore it because SATOU IS BASICALLY A GOD IN THIS WORLD. He\'s practically immortal at this point: he\'s so damn powerful that there wasn\'t even an instance where he was under threat of death so we don\'t even get to consider that possibility.And what about magic?

But I actually enjoyed the pacing and the plot development. Every episode felt like it was building on the world. Though arcs are never too long. I don't think any arc was longer than 2 episodes. Maybe a few arcs could have benefited from a bit more details added, for example, it would have been more fun if they got to explore and discover more things in a labyrinth. But the pacing was always good, developing the plot and completing it without feeling rushed.There are some...questionable ethical choices here. So if people care about whether anime has slaves, maybe this isn't the anime for them. It's always a little questionable as to why the main character insists on keeping them as slaves. Though at least he treats them like family, so I guess it's a sort of way around the ethical issue. It always kind of bothered me a little, but the longer the show progresses, the less their relationship resembles a slave-master relationship, and the more their relationship resembles that of a maid cafe like master-servant relationship.Anyways, it's a fun ride. I've seen some people complain that the pacing is too slow. And that is true if action is what you're looking for. This anime felt more like a slice of life isekai, which was something I greatly enjoyed. Not much depth, with some occasional fan service with naked women. Overall, I'd said it was a fun guilty ride. Would like to see them create a second season, but I doubt that will ever happen. questionable ethical choices here.

Exhausted he finally is able to go to sleep after a crunch. He wakes up in a world similar to the one in the game he helped develop. He even uses his nickname as his new name. Because of an unfortunate event and the fact that his idea, he wanted to implement in the game happened to be his new reality, he goes from...lvl 1 to max lvl in one evening. Now, being overpowered, over equipped and having more cash he knows what to do with, he begins his new life.Despite having a few characters there really is only one that matters and that’s our MC - Satuu. A 29 year old programmer that woke up in the body of a 15 year old in a fantasy world running on game logic, with inventory, stats and levels. As most isekai MC’s he’s OP AF. This time with an ability that basically makes him a god. The ability to learn anything and thanks to his get max lvl quick escapade he can level those skills up to the max in a blink of an eye. On top of that he pulls a lot of skill out of his ass. Some of them he learns without a real good reason.When it comes to his personality… yeah… he has none. He’s just a pure hearted, kind, helpful fool. That said, he’s at least not a complete moron and is aware of his situation and predicament of having a harem of slave (for some reason most isekais have slavery legal) girls, some of which are basically kids. Good thing they are not attracted to him in “that way”.Other characters are just there for no real reason. Most of them contribute little to nothing to advance the plot or even world building.Seriously, this anime uses almost every trick in the cliche book to build its word and play with its tone. It even uses the characters of young, small, demihuman slaves to make the MC seem like a paragon of virtue. Even when he’s doing not so virtuous things (like visiting a brothel) it’s always played like it’s not entirely his fault. Same with kissing characters that look too young or squeezing the breast of one of his companions. Basically he’s living a self indulgent dream without any fault of his own. It’s extremely boring and gets old really fast.I would like to say that the best written parts are his interactions with his companions… and unfortunately that’s true. He acts like a father figure to some, brother to others but in all cases he’s just kind, patient and doesn’t show anything that would suggest he’s not an NPC.The show tries to portray him as clever, intelligent and resolute but that doesn’t really work in a setting when the whole world bends over backwards for him. Every dilemma he’s in is resolved with one of his OP skills and often those that aren’t even set up. He has a problem? He just pulls out another skill out of his ass to save the day.All in all it’s not a bad shot. It’s not good either. It’s just bland and lacks anything that could be considered a creative though. lvl 1 to max lvl in one evening.

I try to not spoil anything in it, because in the case I want to rewatch the show, I don\'t want to know too much about it other than what I think I will remember or surface level details that don\'t really matter much. I just want to make sure my future self understands a bit of how I felt about it and why I gave this mark.Review start:I am in that mood of isekai thrash. This one is a pretty good one as well. Multiple ideas that I liked...to see. It is a chill slice of life type of isekai. Nothing big happens, and it is still good imo. MC is really powerful, but he doesn\'t use his full powers, which is something I ve seen bugged people a lot. Even in situations that kinda required him to use his full powers, he didn\'t do so. I feel like it would be easily understood in the light novel why he doesn\'t use his full powers, but in anime it lowkey seems like he just doesn\'t want to, which is a bummer. I\'ve seen in an later episode tho, something that I thought would be the case, that the skills MC has are really powerful and he can do a lot of stuff at high level, but he doesn\'t know sh t. So that s my only explanation why he doesn\'t go full power, cuz he doesn\'t understand fully what he should do and what works and what not. And he still needs to work to gain those powerful powers, the skills in this anime are mostly like ""he has the aptitude and talent for it"", rather than instantly gain powerful magic that he can always use. He still needs to figure out those magic abilities, which is something I like to see. Brings more color to the story. Also the girls... glad to see that it isn\'t a normal harem, his ""harem"" of girls are slaves he buys (quite a lot lmao) and considers them family. The MC doesn\'t want to f them, and makes it clear so, even tho they want to. He is after all a 31 y old in a body of a 17 y old iirc, so he likes older woman... so I really like this aspect. Especially cuz he does go to some. :) Also, liked the fact that there were other ppl that reincarnated in that world, and one of his slaves also is one and they both know that, and the differences between the MC and them... but I learned more from a comment that detailed what the LN says and what they skipped... which again, is a bummer for me... they skipped details, important ones imo...Story: 8Slice of life isekai, quite a few ideas I liked, but it is a normal story to me, which isn\'t bad, but it is good.Art: 8The fights were quite lackluster, and quite bad imo. Not many fightings also. But the general art was on the more chill vibe, which I enjoyed for this type of story.Characters: 8MC is a bit basic, or so I think. Nothing much shines about him. There are a lot of side characters tho, which each have a personality easily readable, but they somehow make a good group to me... And some characters are a bit too basic, or the interactions between them really lackluster... Feels sometimes like I am watching the interaction between 2 npcs...Enjoyment: 8Enjoyed it. I will look forward to reading the LN when it is finished.Overall: 8Right now it has 6.45 from 283.373 votes with Ranked #6919 Popularity #433 Members 495,652. I recommend it to people that want an isekai that is more slice of life oriented and has a more different dynamic in the ""harem"", and that doesn\'t have the MC going OP everywhere. to see.

I\'ve seen it 4 or 5 times now and will watch it again in the future. It\'s very easy to watch and isn\'t super complicated although this probably would have changed if it had more episodes. That being said this anime would have benefited to have been 24 episodes or atleast have 2 seasons to help get deeper into the lore and backstory.Story: 6.8/10 - the story in my opinion was ok in this anime, it has a decent pace and...a good amount of content without seeming to be thrown together and rushed to much. It is an isekai in a world that is similar to a video game. The MC is OP pretty much from the start but he still has to learn a lot so he doesn\'t seem that OP compared to other OP MCs. One of my major critiques would have to be the ""ecchi"" moments, I could have done without the ""lolis"" that were basically naked with just hair and hands covering themselves. The score would have been a few points higher without the aforementioned ""ecchi"" aspects.Art: 6.5/10 - the art and animation is alright but when it\'s not a close up, the quality drops. The environments are drawn decent but are a little too repetitive and they were also not very detailed which isn\'t expected in this kind of anime. It also looked a little blurry in certain scenes but nothing too crazy. The magic animations were ok and the action scenes were fluid and didn\'t look cut together but it would have been better with less CG especially on the enemy characters.Sound: 6.5/10 - the OP & ED were pretty average and generic but the background music and SFX were decent and sounded realistic , as realistic as magic can I suppose.Characters: 6.5/10 - the characters were pretty well designed and had a decent variety of species. Even the characters that had small parts or were introduced late in the anime were decently designed. The English voice acting was actually pretty good and I recognized a few voices. They seemed to put in a lot of effort and actually brought life to the characters. I haven\'t watched the Japanese version yet but I should try that next for something different.Enjoyment: 7/10 - I actually really enjoyed this anime the 1st time I watched it and I still enjoyed it the 4th time I watched it also. It is entertaining and better than most people say it is. It\'s a good anime to just relax and watch, and it isn\'t so so fast paced that you could read a book while watching.Overall: 6.5/10 - it\'s a decent anime to watch to kill some time or if you enjoy isekai anime or anime with OP MCs. If you have an open mind I\'m sure you will find it interesting and worth a watch. It definitely could have been done better or differently I should say and it definitely should have had another season or another cour. It gets very interesting once the story gets a little further and I would have like to seen it animated.

The main character is very kindhearted and gives catharsis to other viewers who may draw parallels between him and themselves, and many of the scenarios are believable when put into context in the world and the abilities the various characters have. "", ""A very entertaining anime. It was very interesting and well done. The story is a bit cliche, and seems to borrow from other animes of the same genre and type, but has its own style of execution.An Isekai that revolves around our protagonist traveling from our world to a world similar or exact to a game is rather common, but having the MC be part of the main development team of the said game helps ease in an overpowered MC. Although this anime has its hiccups, it's very well done overall.The characters are probably this anime's strong point, as there are done so well. They...each can stand on their own and are fleshed out enough to justify it. They all work in their own different ways but have no issues with working off of each other. Of course, this only really applies to the main cast. The side characters and the one-offs are what you'd expect. They aren't much but they get the job done.The animation is something you'd expect from any new anime, so it's good overall. Also, having the spell chanting be fast and sped up is very unique. It completely removes the long chants used in other fantasy animes and makes it really interesting.Overall, a very underrated anime that deserves a watch. I'd even go and say that it deserves a second season! Also, Pochi and Tama are too cute for their own good, my heartaches.

Give it a watch, I recommend it."", 'When I started watching the first episode, at the beginning, I thought to myself, ""This is just gonna be another average isekai anime"". Boy, was I wrong.I appreciate the light-dark tone of this anime, showing the harsh reality even in a video game/fantasy world. Ranging from slavery to racism and child abuse, which is something that is uncommon in other average isekai anime(s).My only issue is the main character, Satou. He is a Kirito clone. That\'s it. But the way he keeps his relationship with his travelling companions (especially the little girls), is very wholesome.The combat scenes are good because the characters have great teamwork...when it comes to using their skills to defeat enemies. But it gets a bit boring when you see the main character one-shot everything when he\'s going solo.To close off my review, I would recommend this anime to newcomers and returning anime fans. It has great value and it deserves a second season when the novel goes further into the story, providing more source material for the anime to go on. when it comes to using their skills to defeat enemies.

It's based on a really solid novel series (I've read easily over a hundred of them at this point, and it's still among my top 3; sales-wise, the light novel is currently at 29 volumes and still ongoing), but it just doesn't work as a seasonal anime. It's a mix of isekai and slice of life, with a major focus on travelling and crafting, so it's way too slow-paced for this format; the author chose to concentrate on good execution rather that putting an interesting spin on the tired formula, so if you don't care about that, it will probably just look...overplayed and generic to you (not to mention, the MC even looks like Kirito); the world building is mostly done through random comments and bits of information you're supposed to put together on your own during consecutive readings, which also doesn't work in an anime format, where half of those get skipped over to try and speed things along; etc.All in all, it's a solid, heart-warming, slow isekai about a guy having a good time travelling, cooking, crafting, etc., while doting on a bunch of little girls he rescued along the way. The novel is written with adult readers in mind, and it shows, especially when your read it back to back with something like Isekai Smartphone (Not that Smartphone is a bad novel, just a good counterexample. It has a very similar setting, but its MC is a teenager, and you can immediately see the difference in how the two of them act when put in similar situation). The anime production quality is solid across the board, and I really enjoyed both the art style, and the choice of opening/ending music. Overall, I found it engaging enough to give the novel version a try (my first one), and now, several years later, I still keep coming back to it, so I definitely recommend both the anime, and the novel afterwards. overplayed and generic to you (not to mention, the MC even looks like Kirito); the world building is mostly done through random comments and bits of information you're supposed to put together on your own during consecutive readings, which also doesn't work in an anime format, where half of those get skipped over to try and speed things along; etc.All in all, it's a solid, heart-warming, slow isekai about a guy having a good time travelling, cooking, crafting, etc., while doting on a bunch of little girls he rescued along the way.

Midnight Eye: Gokuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1879/Midnight_Eye__Gokuu,"[""This two-part OVA series from 1989 is adapted from the manga by Buichi Terasawa, whose work, I must confess, I'm not terribly familiar with.  But I have seen the Space Adventure Cobra movie, and between that and what I've heard, I gather his stories typically feature two elements: manly men and shapely women.  The first episode of Goku: Midnight Eye, you'll be pleased to hear (or not), has both.Let's get this out of the way: Goku is a standard action movie, albeit one that has all the style and flair you'd expect from director Yoshiaki Kawajiri.  If you go into it expecting...any more, you'll be disappointed. There are no thought provoking themes or deep characterization here.  But despite that, Goku manages to tell an entertaining story.  Which I will now spoil, for this is the only way to convey its greatness.An investigation is being conducted into the activities of a businessman the police suspect of being an arms dealer.  But one by one the officers involved in the surveillance operation are taking their own lives.  Enter Goku Furinji, a wisecracking private detective with terrible dress sense. A tie draped over his bare chest, he positively exudes manliness.  As an ex-cop who was friends with the dead men, Goku takes a personal interest in the case, despite warnings from his old boss to keep out of it.Goku is, of course, far too manly too manly to be deterred, and decides to take matters into his own hands.  After a brief encounter with a naked female android who shoots a laser from her mouth and has motorcycle handlebars mounted on her back, he faces a naked woman with a plume of hypnotic feathers and ends up with no choice but to stab his own left eye in order to save his life.  Then he drives into a river.  What a man.If you're not yet having trouble suspending your disbelief, keep reading.Duing a dream sequence, a booming voice informs a Goku that he has been given a cybernetic eye to replace the one he lost.  He wakes up, inexplicably, on a park bench and soon realizes that it wasn't a dream.  The eye is, quite frankly, shit-hot.  Not only can it access any computer in the world, it can CONTROL them.  Suddenly, Goku is practically invincible.Why was he given this eye?  Who gave it to him?  Where did the technology come from?  Pfft.  If you're the kind of viewer who gives a crap about these kind of details, you probably wouldn't be watching this show in the first place.  Suffice it to say, he wants revenge, and goes about it in the most manly way possible: by jumping from a helicopter and using his infinitely extendable staff to pole-vault through a window several thousand (possibly) floors high.I'm a huge fan of Kawajiri and his unique style is evident throughout Goku: Midnight Eye.  Like his earlier Wicked City, the show takes full advantage of his ability to create a dark, oppressive, gothic urban environment, and it's populated with a cast of elegantly designed characters.  The animation is similarly impressive, with fluid action scenes and minimal reliance on shortcuts.  The cheesy 80s synth music, however, does little but ratchet up the camp factor, which may or may not be a good thing.  I can't quite decide.So what do we have?  A stoic, indestructible hero.  Unspeakably evil bad guys. Plenty of random nudity.  Gorgeous design.  Yep, it's an 80s OVA, it's great fun,  and it's the kind of show that doesn't get made any more.

The storyline starts a bit predictable but evolves into further dark background and some very mysterious charac., villians with some that are introduced fast while others have a more bigger role. the main person in here is definetly no wimp, and it proves it by the fightingstyle,  so is the more marure animation with some good late 80´s sketches, i really was totally...into the story at loads of scene´s , with ofc enjoyable music. into the story at loads of scene´s , with ofc enjoyable music.', 'THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS.SUMMARY: If you love cheesy, goofy late 80s anime shlock with a genuinely well done cyberpunk/noir setting, this is the OVA for you. If you expect an actually good or deep story that doesn\'t go totally off the rails, look elsewhere.Goku Midnight Eye is a 1989 OVA based on the manga of the same name. There are two OVA episodes made, this being the first one, and in my humble opinion far and away the better of the two.Fair word of warning: I\'m a big, big fan of B-movie type stuff, cheesy shlock and all sorts of things that are...unintentionally hilarious. With Goku Midnight Eye, I personally feel like I\'ve landed a real hit for my growing list of material for B-movie nights. As a result, if you expect a review that takes this OVA 100 percent seriously, then I\'m afraid I can\'t help you.On the surface, Goku Midnight Eye has all the makings of a really solid action romp. The animation, courtesy of Madhouse, looks fluid and outright impressive at times. The 80s Cyberpunk setting is very well done, and it\'s no wonder clips/gifs from Goku Midnight Eye show up in a lot of 80s aesthetic collections. Some scenes and moments really do look great, and have a great sense of color and mood. Some of the music also works quite well to round this out.However, and I cannot beat around the bush any longer ... Goku Midnight Eye is also complete and utter cheesy nonsense that I found impossible not to laugh at. I\'m a huge fan of serious Cyberpunk stuff and man, this OVA is not it. It is however genuinely great fun, especially with friends, if you are open to a lovably goofy time. (Bonus points if you pick the dub for this)The story is about a smarmy, dirtbag noir cop utterly coated in cliches who thinks of himself as the coolest dude in the universe. He tries so hard to seem like a total badass, and I thought it was hilarious. The dub only cranks this feeling up to 11, because in typical 80s OVA fashion it adds a ton of swearing and goofy language.Our ""hero"" investigates a dangerous case, comes across a sexy gal and an evil villain, things get violent, then midway-through the story acquires the titular ""Midnight Eye"" implant as a, spoiler, *literal gift from God*. This is never explained. Gods and other such powers were never even mentioned up to this point. It just happens, and is never discussed again. It allows our protagonist to literally hack anything in the world. It\'s as goofy and incredible as it sounds, and just one of many moments of fun action paired with hilarious cheese in this OVA.I\'ll not spoil anything more, especially not the villain\'s master plan which is easily one of the funniest and most incredible villain plans I\'ve ever seen. At some point, there is a fight against a naked woman that is half motorcycle. If that doesn\'t make you want to watch this, nothing will, really.BOTTOM LINE: I overall give Goku Midnight Eye a 5, since on more objective levels I just don\'t think it\'s a particularly well executed OVA. The story explains very little, the characters are cliches, particularly the English dub has a ton of smarmy one liners. There is nothing of real substance there. However, it\'s also such good silly fun that it gets laughs out of me every time. A great watch for similiarly minded friends.CONTENT WARNINGS: Strong violence against women, bunch of exposed boobs, moments of gore, assorted 80s sexism. It all comes across as more harmless and dumb than anything else, since the subject matters aren\'t treated with any sort of depth, but it still felt worth mentioning. unintentionally hilarious.

Still, it perplexes me how subtle and restrained this cyberpunk world feels despite featuring laser firing quadruped android redheads complete with kinky motorbike handles attached and the nature of the titular midnight eye. It seems that once you take away the relentless in your face dose of the far out occult or gorgeous mechanical art that Yoshiaki Kawajiri is so well known for, his equally distinctive atmospheric metropolises bite very close to home; to our own bustling yet uncaring and distant cities.I would dig...deeper into this subtlety but it does not seem intentional as the plot is about as standard and ass kicking as Cyber City Oedo or Wicked City are.My only complaints are its lack of resolution, especially when the two aforementioned ovas are such tight, well crafted packages. Neither the Midnight Eye's benefactors nor the fate of the heroine is made clear, as if these threads were inconsequential, which is frustrating. Even the heroic deaths that female characters often get in Yoshiaki Kawajiri's other works would have given so much closure.The lesser emphasis on standout bizzare/aweing sci fi or supernatural imagery means Midnight Eye does not quite attain the legendary status of other Yoshiaki Kawajiri works but because of this, presents us with the purest form of his badass wisecracking hero prevails over insanely bizzare death encounters formula; and its absolutely top notch entertainment.

What I have watched of him are not necessarily masterpieces like those of others, but I love his style. Unimportant scripts and situations, but an aesthetic that is a fucking blast with a visual mastery, way of ""shooting"" and editing that are solid gold.His films have charm and sparkle, 80s tacky elegance, always developing during nights, in hotels, pubs, discos and strip clubs.

He finds out that these deaths are all connected to one person: a wealthy businessman named Hakuryu, but there's no evidence.This is where things get weird. As Goku digs deeper, he sneaks into the bad guy's base, which is complete with a giant, a half-naked dog-like motorcycle-hybrid woman who shoots pink lasers from her mouth, and robot mosquitoes equipped with anesthesia....Meanwhile, elsewhere, there is also a naked woman with peacock feathers that have eyes on them which hypnotize people, and a guy who has a bunch of the robot mosquitoes stored in his head. Goku is almost hypnotized by the peacock woman, but he gouges out his eye, and then he is saved by some mysterious benefactor for mysterious reasons. The benefactor replaces Goku's eye with a mechanical eye that can control every computer, satellite, and otherwise any mechanical device, and also gives him what is basically some sort of magic stick that can do stuff when paired with the eye. Goku then summarily goes all out and kicks butt in a series of extreme, yet highly entertaining, action sequences.Besides the plot being an absolute cheese-fest, the one-liners Goku gives are gold. He seems to always know the right thing to say at the right time, with deadpan delivery. The voice actor for Goku only had a few other roles, so I guess he wasn't very experienced. At times it sounded like he was just reading straight from the script, which actually made his lines funnier.Technical aspect-wise, this OVA is decent. It has nice animation and character designs, and nice voice acting (except for Goku), especially for the villains, who were played by popular voice actors. The music is good, particularly the ending theme. Some of the sound effects seemed a little off, however.The story, despite its outlandish cheesiness, manages to have a beginning, middle and end, which is more than can be said for a lot of these '80s OVAs. There is virtually zero character development; however, in this kind of show, character development isn't really necessary (and good character development doesn't usually happen within a 50-minute timeframe, anyway). The two female characters in this OVA are both topless for long periods of time, so this is difficult to recommend to the average viewer, but it's definitely watchable and enjoyable.Recommended for people who like a good dose of cheesy action, if you don't mind the outrageousness and the nudity.

Interestingly enough, this season's focus isn't as much on tomb raid/guarding and instead has alot of political manuvering. That said, this is still an enjoyable watch, the fights are...good and the plot is quite interesting. Some of the plot threads in the previous seasons get expanded/resolved here.

Mahou no Idol Pastel Yumi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3660/Mahou_no_Idol_Pastel_Yumi,"['English is not my language.Mahou no Idol Pastel Yumi, one of the pioneers of Mahou Shoujo in the 80s.Well, the anime is a lot of fun.The story is about a girl who loves flowers, and one day two little animals appear to her, Kakimaru and Keshimaru.The anime follows an episodic pattern, focused more on comedy.It\'s fun to watch. Every episode has a plot, in which Yumi usually uses her magical powers to help herself or someone else....It can be quite repetitive, but it\'s worth it because it\'s funny.The comedy is really good. Early on, Yumi is late for school, and she decides to wear a costume made with magic to go to class, but the magic has a time limit (not set, which generates script conveniences), and the costume disappears and she leaves. running only in her panties on the street (looks more like a diaper haha).Another example is your grandfather ""fighting"" a gorilla who escapes from the zoo.Characters usually have a small plot in the story. Most are pretty cool, even if it\'s nothing grand.My biggest problem with this anime is magic. As it does not have a time limit, it is conveniently used. For example: sometimes the spell ends too quickly, and sometimes it takes a long time.Another thing I didn\'t like was some episodes that used flashback to recap. It was boring to see the same thing with another character telling what I\'ve already seen. As it\'s kind of a recap, it lasted a long time in the episode.The ending wasn\'t so good either. It\'s very convenient and also has inconsistencies in what was going on.Anyway, it has its positive points and its negative points like every anime. But as a whole it is good anime episode by Mahou Shoujo. It can be quite repetitive, but it\'s worth it because it\'s funny.The comedy is really good.

While it's not the best in the genre it's definitely worth your time and remembering. Especially from the art style point of view. Sweet piece of animation for kids but I can say it's easily for anyone who like this type of animes. Pretty problematic piece to review again - but we all like it. It was quite funny journey this time...STORY: 5Quite low, I know, but it's bloody mahou shoujo from the mid of 80s, from the guy who brought one of the best in genre - Magical Emi, just...look at the characteristics in art and characters. But goin' back to the story.Yumi is a sweet, nature-loving girl that always takes care for it, especially the flowers. One day she meets two flower fairies who touched by her commitment for the flowers gave her magic power, the magic cane and the beautiful pedant.  When she uses cane to draw, anything she draws becomes real as long pedant is not flashing, because after it starts to flash there's only about 30 seconds before the magic power dissapears. And that's the main source of the gags. It's quite mediocre story about clumsy, sweet girl that receives magic power and has to deal with the responsibilities and everyday life. The good thing is that the series is only 25 episodes long. What back in 80s was a quite short series.ART: 8That's the best part of the show. Especially as the creators were working on few other mahou shoujjo animes before, especially mentioned already  Magical Emi. There's a lot of similarities and and cuteness known from that anime. The colors are beautiful, full of pastels and beautifully drawn backgrounds, not to mention godly presented main character. Of course please keep in mind we talking about mid 80s anime. So art was great 30 years ago, but hardly can be called good in 2019. Keep that in mind.The animation is quite smooth itself and there's not much downs with it after all. Moves and details are decent so are characteristics and anatomy.SOUND: 5Weakest part of the series but nothing uncommon back in the day AND today especially as the copy I get wasn't quite... good. Main seyiuu was good as well as some of the characters but music was forgettable, voice and sound quality very, very poor, sometimes I had problems with understand dialogues because of poor recording quality. But as I said - I'm used to it and I'm sure u can find better quality or even some subs/dubs.CHARACTER: 6There's only one character that is worth to mention, Yumi, the main. Everything is about her, her character development is quite decent but nothing much original or over the 'mahou shoujo' style. Reliable building and backstory combined with lovely character design and writing gives fair, sweet girl that anyone can love.ENJOYMENT: 9And that an hella high score, I know. Apart fromo all downs that the series have the enjoyment os godly. Gags and jokes typical but keeping u smiling all the time, story is bit mediocre but for some reason keeps u by the screen episode after episode, main character becoming ur best friend in a second. Art style, beautiful setting, colorful world and sweet mc gives u no other choice but love it. And love a lot.OVERALL: 6Can ask after that review: ONLY? Yeah, 6 is an fair rating for this anime. Considering all it's flaws and downs, sound and story  especially I'm suprised how well the anime is maintaining to keep you interest through the whole 25 episodes so by the end I was actually suprised that is end already. As responsible writer I need to mention again - it's VERY typical mahou shoujo anime, mostly for genre maniacs like me, but I can actually suggest it to anyone with open mind and viewers who want to know something more about japanese animation itself.It's a good piece of anime, hovewer, have troubles with the time passing. Nothing to be scared after all. It's sweet story for basically everyone, especially kids.Dear mal users, really, this anime should be remembered. Not with 344 users ratings, but at least with ten times that amount. Go for it guys, it's still available to watch. Go for it before it dissapears forever. look at the characteristics in art and characters.

Mushikago no Cagaster,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38663/Mushikago_no_Cagaster,"[""First impressions are crucial to how we make decisions. It’s therefore no secret as to why many will choose to avoid watching this show. It’s true that it leaves a lot to be desired visually, but there are positives underneath its rather unattractive surface.Set in a barren post-apocalyptic future where most of the population has transformed into giant CGI monstrosities in the form of insects. The remaining population struggle to survive in fortified, self-governed cities. Where the people live in constant fear of their neighbour or loved one turning into an insect-like form and devouring them. To stop the insectification from spreading, there are exterminators...who take care of the pests. One such exterminator is Kidou. A young man with a troubled past who found his purpose by fighting the insects. That is until he gets the task to escort a young girl back to her mother, somewhere in the dangerous wasteland.The setting is the show's most prominent characteristic and the first half is used to develop it. It dragged a bit but the second half became more enjoyable because of it. The insects are set-up as a real threat to the people, and they are taken with the seriousness they should. However, there are a couple of things that tells you otherwise. For example, in the first half we spend most of the time in a city that’s protected by a massive wall. But since most of the insects fly, it’s pretty much useless. Some parts like this could've been better explained, although with only twelve episodes of runtime I’d say they did well enough. By the end it’s wrapt up nicely and the characters are well realized.Kidou is a man who pushes people away from him to not grow attached. As his job could mean having to potentially kill a person close to him. Almost his whole life has gone towards his exterminator mission, which has taken its toll on him. But it starts to change with the arrival of Illie, the girl he decides to help. She felt like a very shallow love interest in the beginning. But she helps Kidou grow as a person, and is a crucial part of the second half and her backstory is one of the show’s most engaging parts. They both have a certain level of depth to them that sadly the rest of the characters don’t have. But since most of them have very little contribution to the story, it’s understandable.The soundtrack didn't stick out much and it's contribution wasn't all that memorable either. The voice performances on the other hand tuned out to be of higher quality. Kana Hanazawa especially knocked it out of the park in the role of Ilie. Some other were a bit tacky in their line delivery, but not to a distracting extent.All in all I found it to be serviceable. Largely because I have a soft spot for settings like this. But also due the main leads, who were more engaging than I expected going in. The visuals are this show’s biggest downfall with the robotic and stiff movements, making it hard to recommend. Thankfully the first episode will give you a good idea as to what you can expect going forward. If you don't like the first episode then you should skip the rest.Now if you would like something better with a similar premise then watch Nausicaä. If you for some reason would like to watch something shittier then watch Island of Giant Insects. who take care of the pests. One such exterminator is Kidou.

From the screenshots alone I thought I wouldn't enjoy the animation and art style and was going to skip watching this, but I decided I had enough free time and started episode one. Next thing I knew, I was hooked.The story starts off slow in the beginning, so you have to be willing to wait a few episodes in before it begins to get interesting.The fight scenes, between the bugs and humans aren't as...intense as you would expect, but the sound and voice acting is top notch and helps the scenes flow smoothely.The is a wide variety of characters, but overall the development of Ilie, Kidow, and the rest had me emotional and guessing what would happen next after each episode. Overall I believe you would be able to rewatch this anime several times and discover something new.I would recommend this anime to anyone who is willing to try something new, and hopefully you too will discover this gem of an anime on Netflix. intense as you would expect, but the sound and voice acting is top notch and helps the scenes flow smoothely.The is a wide variety of characters, but overall the development of Ilie, Kidow, and the rest had me emotional and guessing what would happen next after each episode.

Kidow is an insect exterminator that in the opening scene happens to be escaping from a huge swarm of flying worms. When he strives to survive from that swarm he finds out that despite him and his friend - he's not the only one person trying to escape. Unfortunately for the other escapists - the car droved by them meets with accident in which driver dies. It turns out that these car passangers are father and daughter. Father dies - begs...our MC to deliver his daughter to her mother and that's how the story begins.Kinda cliche i have to admit, but later on in the story it turns out that that's not some random kid and her father wasn't some ordinary father. Saying something more than that could be considered as a spoiler so let's just skip it and say that despite on focusing on the kiddo abilities - the plot is also about creating a strong bond between Illie (that's kiddo name) and Kidow.Nothing outstanding about the story, however there are some stupid moments like one character dying for at least 2 episodes if not more and saying that it's his end for tenth time already.5/10Art:*KNOCK KNOCK*-Who's there?-It's Netflix CGI again, surprise!I'm not a CGI fan (i doubt anybody is) however i've seen many worse CGI anime and this one isn't that bad. I mean it's still bad but as a CGI - this one is okay.6/10Sound:I have no complains there. Music was good, voice acting was the same.7/10Characters:They are bad. Kidow is a typical edgy boy that turns out to not being edgy behind the edgy mask later on. However, some of his actions are so stupid that it doesn't convienced me to like him. Actually not only Kidow actions are stupid. There are many stupid characters in the show. Like a scientist that claims that science is his top1 prority so he doesn't have any remorse to use his family in experiments. But then later on you see in the flashbacks that he actually cares for his family only to find out later that he really don't. Then again it turns out that he actually does. But maybe he doesn't? I don't know myself. I doubt any of the viewers knows. If some of the characters aren't stupid then later on it turns out that they're not interesting either. It was barely possible to me to name more than three of them after show ended.Oh, I almost forgot. In the first couple episodes there was one awesome death. It was really well made. It was only a shame that creators didn't focused more on dead character and didn't postponed his death to late series. I didn't cared when he died because it happened too soon. Kinda wasted potencial that death was, but what can I say? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯4/10Enjoyment:Despite stupidity, bad characters and CGI animation I've got to admit that it was still enjoyable. Not to the point that i'd sink in but it's a good show to watch when you have nothing to do, not much time and don't want to think much over something. Just sit down, watch it and forget it.6/10Overall:5.5/10 but MAL doesn't allow to give halves so i'll stay with 5/10 our MC to deliver his daughter to her mother and that's how the story begins.Kinda cliche i have to admit, but later on in the story it turns out that that's not some random kid and her father wasn't some ordinary father.

It brings me great pleasure to be one of the few who might actually understand the masterpiece behind this anime.Story: 10Art - 8Sound - 9Character - 10Enjoyment - 8Overall - 9Starting from what is considered ""bad"" about the show, the 3D CGI may put off a lot of people, but that is easily overlooked when considering everything else the show has to offer. Personally, I also believe Cagaster of an Insect Cage is one of the few shows that pulls off CGI extremely well. The...Cagasters are big and creepy, and the large 3D models only help to solidify the creepy atmosphere that the bugs carry around them. By taking advantage of the CGI animation, the fight scenes are well choreographed and have an insane amount of detail to them.Music is something that can make or break an anime, especially when it plays during crucial moments. You won\'t really remember Cagaster\'s OST after watching the show, but you will definitely notice it while watching. It is one of those soundtracks that perfectly adds to the show when it\'s most needed, while not standing out in any way. The soundtrack fills it\'s role well, but no more and no less. However, an OP and ED song that pan in during important cliffhangers at the end of an episode are all an anime needs to hype. If you haven\'t already, I highly recommend listening to the OP and jamming out. It is an absolute banger of a song!Now for the real review (Spoilers from here on out!):Cagaster of an Insect Cage\'s story and writing design are what truly makes this anime so great. When analyzing how well put together a story is, I take a look at the technical aspects of the writing and the weight that previously planned plot points have. Much like Violet Evergarden (another amazing anime), Cagaster uses the first few episodes to build up the characters, by introducing Ilie and the characters that revolve around her past, as well as Kidou\'s history of becoming an exterminator we get an idea of how the setting and antagonists react to them, and why their personal reasons for doing what they do. When people talk about ""character development,"" they refer to how much a certain character has improved individually. But when I talk about character development, I look at how the characters and their relationships develop with each other, and how those relationships can affect their morality. SPOILERS: When Kasim died, we see just how much he cared for Naji and the other children. He blames himself for destroying their home and helps them as much as he can to make up for it. As an individual character he is finally able to be forgiven, and dies with contentment. However, the relationships he had with both the children and Kidou are where the writing design truly shine! The way his death affects the children push them to move forward past their clutches of the destroyed community, while for Kidou it has the opposite affect. As Kasim died by turning into a Cagaster, Kidou was forced to execute him due to his job of being a heartless exterminator. They were close friends, but Kidou still had to do it, for the sake of Kasim. Kidou grants him peace, while taking on the hatred of Kasim\'s loved ones for killing him. This reminds Kidou of his role as a cold exterminator and decides to pursue being a killing machine once more.In an attempt to become closer to Lazarus, Kidou spent most his life practicing extermination techniques and destroying his own humanity in order to kill more effectively. However, when Lazarus reveals that he is still reluctant to exterminate and his own morals, Kidou feels betrayed. This is also seen in Franz and Acht. Franz wishes to understand his deceased father and goes to extreme lengths to do so, while Acht struggles against himself and whether or not he is a human or monster. All three of these conflicts are mirrored in another character or more.The entire moral of the story and where the real juice stems from, is the hint of humanity, morals, and the past in the characters. Lazarus\' indecisiveness passes onto his son, Kidou. At least, it should have. Kidou lies to himself constantly, as one would need to in order to kill monsters that were once humans. To throw away your humanity in order to do so, and for what? To become closer to somebody that is already dead and who betrayed your morals right before dying? Kidou faces these problems and this dilemma of whether to be held by his past and something he no longer believes in, or to change for the future after regaining his humanity through other characters, like Kasim and his legacy.In the end, Franz and Tania are finally reunited in death while their eternal love is reflected in Kidou and Ilie\'s own relationship. Very early on in the story, Kidou mentions meeting a god who saved him. The entire show we are tricked to believe this is Lazarus, but it can actually refer to Acht. Somehow Acht must have impacted Kidou\'s own morals back them, but Acht also had to been affected. Their fateful meeting stems deeper, as Acht searches for Kidou to kill him. Acht struggles with being a monster, and so it would be fitting for Kidou, an exterminator, to be the one to kill him.What I\'m trying to say is that everybody\'s fates and morals are all affected and intertwined with one another. This is something that is very hard to accomplish well, especially because it requires copious amount of planning from the very start.All the characters find their own resolute meaning to life, after being crushed by their morals and dilemmas previously. By meeting the characters needed to do so, they move forward in life with a different meaning than the one forced upon them by their past generation. Infact, in many cases their resolution is also the answer to the past generation\'s problems. Ilie is an insect queen, while Kidou is an exterminator who kills insects. This ironic contrasts of characters and how when Franz finally realizes his love for Tania, Kidou himself realizes his own love for Ilie. Through his battles between Acht and being influenced by Ilie\'s own struggles, Kidou finally decides to move past his lie of being a cold exterminator, and gives a new shot at being human with his newly kindled love for Ilie.There is so much deep mirroring and contrast in each character\'s own morals that I can\'t even begin to fathom. All in all, Cagaster of an Insect Cage is what I would call an, ""experience."" It is truly an experience which will change the way you view yourself as a human and the things that make or take your humanity. Cagasters are big and creepy, and the large 3D models only help to solidify the creepy atmosphere that the bugs carry around them. By taking advantage of the CGI animation, the fight scenes are well choreographed and have an insane amount of detail to them.Music is something that can make or break an anime, especially when it plays during crucial moments.

To throw away your humanity in order to do so, and for what? To become closer to somebody that is already dead and who betrayed your morals right before dying? Kidou faces these problems and this dilemma of whether to be held by his past and something he no longer believes in, or to change for the future after regaining his humanity through other characters, like Kasim and his legacy.In the end, Franz and Tania are finally reunited in death while their eternal love is reflected in Kidou and Ilie\'s own relationship. Very early on in the story, Kidou mentions meeting a god who saved him. The entire show we are tricked to believe this is Lazarus, but it can actually refer to Acht. Somehow Acht must have impacted Kidou\'s own morals back them, but Acht also had to been affected. Their fateful meeting stems deeper, as Acht searches for Kidou to kill him. Acht struggles with being a monster, and so it would be fitting for Kidou, an exterminator, to be the one to kill him.What I\'m trying to say is that everybody\'s fates and morals are all affected and intertwined with one another. This is something that is very hard to accomplish well, especially because it requires copious amount of planning from the very start.All the characters find their own resolute meaning to life, after being crushed by their morals and dilemmas previously. By meeting the characters needed to do so, they move forward in life with a different meaning than the one forced upon them by their past generation. Infact, in many cases their resolution is also the answer to the past generation\'s problems. Ilie is an insect queen, while Kidou is an exterminator who kills insects. This ironic contrasts of characters and how when Franz finally realizes his love for Tania, Kidou himself realizes his own love for Ilie. Through his battles between Acht and being influenced by Ilie\'s own struggles, Kidou finally decides to move past his lie of being a cold exterminator, and gives a new shot at being human with his newly kindled love for Ilie.There is so much deep mirroring and contrast in each character\'s own morals that I can\'t even begin to fathom. All in all, Cagaster of an Insect Cage is what I would call an, ""experience."" It is truly an experience which will change the way you view yourself as a human and the things that make or take your humanity.', 'This is my first review, so it might be a bit flawed, but we all gotta start somewhere I guess. Here we go:Story:Mushikago no Cagaster, or Cagaster of an Insect Cage is a Netflix original, and takes place in a post apocalyptic world, where humans are facing extincion after a disease (or something idk) turns some humans into massive, human killing insects. And we watch as Kidou, an executioner who\'s job is to deal with infected people, and Ilie, a girl that kidou saves and promises to take to her mother, the story then goes on, and we get more dept into these characters,...and also get intoduced to some other characters who also has some backstory that connects with the other ones.The story is what caught my eye when I was scrolling through Netflix. I love post apocalypse shows, and the idea of there being giant killing insects that does it made me jump right into it. Sadly, most of the time they are mainly only seen for lore reasons, and we don\'t get to see as much action as I wished with them.The story doesn\'t finish, which makes me believe that we\'ll get a season 2 in the future, and allthough I didn\'t get as much insect vs executioner action as I wish I got, the story was still very interesting and had some cool twists and backstories were for the most part fun and interesting. 7/10Art:Now for me, the art was super inconsistent. Characters are full CGI, while the background is mainly drawn, something that resulted in that characters looked completely off compared to the backgrounds. Now fully 3D characters can be done and look well if done right (just look at Beastars), but for me, not only did they often walk in a very weird, robot-like style sometimes, but often, they would look so emotionless, like, well, robots!Luckily, the backgrounds look stunning and sometimes I would just look at it and be like ""woah, that looks cool!"" And fighting animations, are for the most part really well done and entertaining. So even though it stays very inconsistent, I still think it was alright in the end. 6/10Sound:Now I didn\'t really pay a lot of attention to the sound of it, and that\'s both a good thing and a bad thing. It\'s good because it means it fit the circumstances, but it\'s bad because it didn\'t really give me that much extra. I would\'ve given it a 6, but it so happens that the opening song was actually pretty damn good in my opinion. It\'s like one of those ""the more you listen, the more you enjoy it"" type of song. So it lifts the sound rating up to 7/10Characters:Now, the characters for me were pretty basic, but still decent. Kidou is your average emotionless killer with a tragic backstory that then slowly start caring about people.Ilie, is a bit up and down for me, I can\'t reallty say alot about her without spoiling, but she also has some backstory, but i can\'t say alot more.Then there\'s the side characters. I won\'t say anything on characters that come later because I ain\'t spoiling anything, just trust me when I say most of them are allright/decent.Jin is allright I guess, he\'s basically a treasure hunter with barely any screentime.Mario is awesome, really cool, and funny character, not really what you expect but yeah, awesome 10/10 would reccomend.There is also another character that we don\'t get to see until a little before half way I think, I\'m not gonna spoil anything but he\'s a really cool character with an interesting backstory, I\'m not gonna say his name, but you\'ll definetly know who I\'m talking about if I say he\'s a bit different from the others.In general, good characters. 7/10Enjpyment:Allthough I didn\'t 100% get what I wanted, I still enjoyed watching the show. Fight scenes and story was really nice, and allthough everyone looked like robots trying to act human, they still were able to give some nice face expressions here and there in dull situations that made me laugh. Nothing I went out of my way to watch, but it was fun. 7/10Overall:In the end, the show was pretty damn average, I really wanted it to be a suprise hit, and allthough it was good, it didn\'t offer a lot of the good stuff people want when they watch the show.I would reccomend it, if you just wanna watch a nice, decent show with some nice story, fight scenes and, you know, INSECTS! It\'s not something I will force down people\'s throats, but if you come up to me and say: ""I wanna watch this, what to you think?"" I\'d say: ""It\'s decent, you should go for it"" But don\'t expect something groundbreaking that sends you through the atmosphere, and you just wonder how something so amazing wasn\'t published before Feb 6 2020, because it won\'t live up to anything, it\'s decent, but nothing special!I give it a 6.8/10, which rounds up to 7/10 and also get intoduced to some other characters who also has some backstory that connects with the other ones.The story is what caught my eye when I was scrolling through Netflix.

Maybe Mario was okay but that\'s it. But don\'t worry, it won\'t really matter cause the desing and animation are so bad that you could HARDLY tell a couple characters apart. They also pull a ""oh I bet you didn\'t think this person was gonna come back like this"" and you\'re just there like.. ""who??

Who will win?Story & Characters: Cagaster of an Insect Cage takes place in 2125, when a terrible illness known as the Cagaster starts to infect large populations.  This disease morphs the inflicted into gigantic, savage insects.  These insects are large, fierce, and kill on sight, sporting large sickles and hard bodyarmour-like shells.  Kidou is a professional exterminator, very adept at killing these insects with his quick thinking and strong physic.  While on a mission one day, he stumbles upon a damaged car with a dying parent, who pleads Kidou to take his daughter, Ilie, to find...her mother, as they\'re stuck in the middle of nowhere.  Taking his request, Kidou takes Illie to live with him in his base of operations where he vows to help track down this mother, with very little to go on.  In this town, we see how bad it\'s gotten due to the Cataster outbreak and how humans eventually turn on each other when things get desperate.  This, along with the Cagaster nest that\'s discovered, bring about much tension for the audience.  Or so the series tries to do anyway.On the face of this all, I wouldn\'t mind the story so much if it wasn\'t executed so poorly.  It\'s suppose to make you on edge at all times because of these ferocious insects, and they spoil any opportunity to do so.  There\'s so much in-town strife that, really, doesn\'t involve the main problem at all.  Lizzy, who we meet about halfway through, is taking care of orphaned kids and the entire thing adds very little to the overall plot.  My guess is that it\'s there to serve as a reminder of the effect that these insects have on kids\' lives, but it really didn\'t speak to me.  I think part of the problem is that we are always ""told"" of the damage that both the virus and the resulting insects do, but we\'re never really showed much of it.  While you never want to show death after death all the time, it serves to tense your audience and this series sorely needed more of that.Kidou seems to care pretty deeply for Illie, but he forces himself to show no care for her when he can.  He\'s just a mindless puppet that seeks to kill.  And while I love me some killing machines, that\'s literally all Kidou comes off as.  Ilie is a slightly better character in that she tries to toughen up and show Kidou that she \'can\' be useful, but her weak physic does get in the way more often than not.  It feels like plot armour at times.  That being said, she does have some backstory that\'s revealed to us a little later on, and while it\'s a decent, again, I just don\'t feel like they execute anything around it very well.  It\'s suppose to be tense, but I just found myself bored.Side characters are pretty meh all around.  Franz is a scientist that gets introduced to us a few episodes in and following his agenda of ideas is confusing at the best of times.  He makes weird decisions leading to problematic outcomes so you can never really get what his motivations are.  Acht is a confusing character as well, as he has motivations and that decently laid out to us, but the conclusion of his story seems so random.  You get why they left him off where they do, but what was the payoff for him? Mario is a bar owner, which houses Kidou.  I loved Mario.  Highly excitable, acts on words and hilarious to top it all off.Despite the fact that the show wanted us to feel tense, there just weren\'t enough high moments to offset the frequent talking and lack of action.  I expected an apocalyptical chaos-driven story, but this lacked that at so many corners.  (Story: 4/10, Characters: 5/10)Art: For being full CG, this looked really ugly at just about any time that didn\'t include the insects.  Now, I love the designs for these insects.  They looked dangerous, ferocious and would have probably me feel like I was watching God Eater or Attack on Titan, if we showed in action more than they were.  However, most everything else looked pretty flat and boring.  (6/10)Sound: The OST was decent here, but blank at others.  Most times, I only really ask for that.  The OP and EDs were fine, though I kind of wished three of them weren\'t by the same band.  Voice work was mostly fine.  I really don\'t get the appeal as to why Aleks Le (Kidou) has been getting these main roles lately, but I haven\'t been a fan of his work lately and his work here left me wanting more.  Most of the other VOs were solid - Todd Haberkorn (Franz), Griffin Burns (Acht) and Kim Strauss (Mario) are all worthy of praise.  I\'ve always been on the fence with Ryan Bartley\'s work (Ilie), but she was decent here.  (7/10)Overall Enjoyment: Cagaster of an Insect Cage really leaves more to be desired.

(5/10)', '*No Spoilers*Summary:Cagaster of an Insect Cage is a sci-fi anime based in a post-apocalyptic world in which some humans are turned into massive insects that murder people. The protagonist, Kidou, fights these insects for a living. In the first episode, he saves a girl who becomes central to the story later on. Overall, the story is interesting and not too hard to follow along with. The theme of what it means to be human in this apocalyptic world is well explored, and, if you are new to this genre, I recommend it as a starting point.Story: 6/10The story overall is above average for this genre...of anime. The characters play a big role in the plot instead of everything just happening to them. Overall, the pacing of the story is appropriate, and the world-building is interesting. The plot is somewhat predictable, but I believe this would be a good sci-fi anime for someone who is new to this genre.Art: 5/10The art is sufficient, although some scenes do have strange walking animations. Overall, the backgrounds and world as a whole are well-designed. The characters are also neatly dressed without any terrible color choices like some anime have.Sound: 5/10The soundtrack, openings, and endings are slightly above average in terms of anime music. There’s nothing too memorable about the music, although the ending theme is pretty catchy. Some scenes have very fitting background music. The voice acting is definitely above average for a Netflix original anime, which I am going to weigh heavily for this category.Character: 5/10Characters are above average in the anime. Some characters are written like simple plot devices and others are more fleshed out. Unfortunately, we know some traumatic experiences of our main characters, but not too much about their interests. With that said, the main character’s backstory does an excellent job leading to his character development throughout the story and does explain his aggressive behavior. Luckily, the characters’ goals are fairly clear, and the characters aren’t wishy-washy like in many anime of this genre.Enjoyment: 5/10There were some scenes that were rather appalling due to the main character’s treatment of another character, but overall, this was an enjoyable anime. I don’t think I would watch it more than once because it is relatively straightforward, but this was far more enjoyable than many other Netflix original anime.Overall: 5.2/10 of anime. The characters play a big role in the plot instead of everything just happening to them. Overall, the pacing of the story is appropriate, and the world-building is interesting.

Some characters are written like simple plot devices and others are more fleshed out. Unfortunately, we know some traumatic experiences of our main characters, but not too much about their interests. With that said, the main character’s backstory does an excellent job leading to his character development throughout the story and does explain his aggressive behavior. Luckily, the characters’ goals are fairly clear, and the characters aren’t wishy-washy like in many anime of this genre.Enjoyment: 5/10There were some scenes that were rather appalling due to the main character’s treatment of another character, but overall, this was an enjoyable anime. I don’t think I would watch it more than once because it is relatively straightforward, but this was far more enjoyable than many other Netflix original anime.Overall: 5.2/10', 'This anime has everything. I found that a lot of the Japanese animes are either too silly or too serious, this one fits right in the middle. I was mostly attached to the romance part. Our main girl, fourteen Elie falls for our seventeen somewhat edgy protagonist Kidow. People complain about she being too young, but nothing happened, just innocent puppy love. There was a happy ending, I’m now hoping they’ll make a sequel. I love to see how their relationship will develop, but of course they’ll have to be a few years older.This is definitely worth watching. The artworks and frighting scenes...were amazing. It’s definitely underrated, I’ll rewatch it when I have time. were amazing. It’s definitely underrated, I’ll rewatch it when I have time.', 'ok so.. uhm.. I actually have nothing to say about this piece of ""art"". It\'s okay. No like that\'s really it. It\'s neither good or bad. The animation has some flaws (but thats cgi I guess I don\'t really expect something out of it). I really do like the character designs tho!  The big Insects actually looked scary sometimes which is great! I mean they kill humans and are Insects.. they are supposed to be scary. I really just don\'t like that we\'ve seen 3 different types of insects in this anime like 95% of those insects are wasps and it just gets boring...over time. I really can\'t say something about the soundtrack because I literally forgot how it sounded like which is bad of course but I guess it can\'t be so bad because I wouldn\'t have forgotten it. (I think this was the most failed sentence in all english history holy fu-) I personally had fun watching this anime and that is the most important thing. 6/10. over time.

No full body paragraph essay here.The animation style isn't my thing. It's awkward and could've been better BUT, BUT, the storyline was pretty great. I was I instantly hooked on it and binged the show. I liked the characters and the uniqueness of the story. The development between the characters were good. I guess the only 'negative' thing would be the animation. It wasn't good, period. Though if you can see through that you'll enjoy the anime. At first glance I was like 'what the heck is this' and I wasn't going to watch until some inner voice...told me why not give it a try. So I did. You'll either hate it or like it.

The beginning of the spread and causes of outbreaks still unknown, or rather i must believe unexplain. Yet the story start with new era of the insect-human hybrid called Cagaster, so why go to past to study the reason? Thats what the author believe for this show. After the outbreaks, all scientist just gone crazy, and think to control Cagaster by making some of the queen. What a story, i shall say weird. Why need queen? Th bug move individually so why need colony, and more over why need the queen? Idk, too simple, so the show just...make the whole story parts feel unrealistic and failure to the logical senses.I can't blame more. This is how the show pointing out the drama near the end of the world full of the huge insects. Even the little girl and a lame guy acts like, they both can easily lived together forever. Because they just saved thousand times by plot armour, which is somehow make me sick. More over to the whole millitary and leader parts of the story. Or even to the technology. Since this is the future, i dont see nice tech for the tanks, even M1, M4 tanks were too dumb for this future, man. I know human in crisis, there. However, when they can create huge megapolis cities like City E 01 (by now), or even the past city like E 07 (demolish and being an insect cage, and the City of Far East (gone as an insect cage), why dont they bring the tech to the weapons only creatures to distinguished the bugs? The millitary here were just a dull and a complete useless, because they are too traditional to even called as a future people.Those logical failure really irked me at the end, especially for the SciFi elements. Sighed. They even cant explain to that thing, in well performed, or rather i called it, an ignorance. They still believe to the audience, that the tech only for the Franz ideologism, which is a bad plot for the good story. Sadly for the people on that era, they be induced to go back to the stone age again, and fight the whole huge insects horde with only Ak-47 and dumb tanks. Even some people only use knife? Just crazy story telling, there. Facepalmed.I may complain another parts, because too many shitty confussion confict happen everywhere. Especially with the fact that this series adheres to the understanding of insect colonies, such as bees, and so. The confussion questions, like, why Tania was only the only queen appear? Why the colony only happen when human created them? Even the reason of controlling the Cagaster feel nonsense and unacceptable. Ffs. If this series still hanging for the simple adventures and survival show of the wild worlds full of insects, i kinda make this show some nice scores. But, with the mess to the story sections, i kinda negate all of the possitivity. Hell, even the drama romance between young lady with the late teenage can not save my point for bad review. However, since im a good people, i make an exceptions.Especially if this included for my favourite VA HanaKana, i will never give such a bad review for my beloved lady, never. Then, for the sake of that, and even plus to the nice sound tracks and backsound, i give this plus 3. So my final blow goes to 7 points per 10.To the details, as states above, the story sections got my worst summary. Even i shall take my 1 for that story shit. This is serious. Next for the sounds music, its good, rather i say 8 maybe. To the art, tho, since i dont really quite enjoy the 3G animations, i give 6 for my maximum point for this show. Characterization feels dull and boring to me. So i create with no more than 7 for the series to show my respect for Ilie cute moments and HanaKana choice of characterization. Ah, too long for me to listen the angelic sounds of HanaKana, lol. For that, the enjoyment shall be enough to put at 8 points for the max.Thats all my short review summary. I cant give a long-run write while i am in a bad mood and stucked mind of writing. Gladly this is over so i can continue to watch another show.

The plot is different and not cliché, but the execution is overused. The art is a hit or miss depending on the viewer, while the sound is decent but nothing special. Characters are sterotypical and lacked a solid lore. The anime is hard to binge-watch due to dull enjoyment.The story revolves around an infectious disease that turn people into cagasters (insects.) Think of a typical zombie movie such as World War Z, but instead of human corpses consuming other humans, its giant insects. This is an interesting...concept, but the execution fails. There are many routes the anime could have taken to add a more unique experience, but instead, bland. The way humans tenfold in size becoming an insect is unrealistic, and its annoying how all bugs appear the same; in the twelve episodes, there were no more than three to five types. Then there are two factions, the Allied Army and Exterminators, vying for power to be the main resistance force to counter this plague. Instead of working together, the two constantly have inner-fighting and betrayels that take away from the original concept; it feels more like a squabbling war than an actual human versus bug war, which the anime pushes for originally.The art can be considered amazing or poor depending on the viewer. For someone that enjoys 3D games, such as the anime role-playing-game ""Genshin Impact,"" its phenomenal art. If a viewer prefers a modern take of anime, then watching this anime can be painful. In regards of sound, overall it was fair. There are no issues with the voice acting, but the sound effects were disappointing. Three examples include: cagasters sound like an annoying house fly buzzing around, discharged weapons sound like pellet guns, and explosions sound like a generic ""boom"" audio file pulled off youtube.There are two solid main characters, and a vivid side cast, that viewers can connect to; however, their lores are vague and jumbled. The backstory of Kidow, male lead, is weak and sterotypical; rough childhood that turns him into an emotionless killer. Ilie, female lead, has a forced backstory shrouded by confusion that ties with her parents and brother; the anime does not take the time to clarify her, nor her family\'s, backstory and tries to justify it with vague remarks involving lab experiments gone wrong. Ilie\'s personality is also stereotypical; a clueless and whiny girl who ends up being the solution to everything towards the end of the story. Some side characters are given too much screen time, especially with the lack of backstory; they were used more to fill-in screen time. The bar owner, Mario, is the biggest culprit of this; viewers will find the original introduction of this character interesting, but lack of character backstory will leave them scratching their heads.A majority of anime out there is considered ""binge-watch"" worthy, but this one is not. Viewers will have a hard time watching several episodes in a row without becoming bored; anyone that can passionately watch all twelve of these episodes, non-stop, would be surprising.Overall the anime is average (5/10) and not worth prioritizing.

You already know from the rating that this show ultimately failed to make it to even baseline quality; allow me to elaborate.The limitations of budget 3D animation are all too apparent in all of these 3D anime; in this case, tragically so. Cagaster actually looks surprisingly good at times. Some of the character models aren’t...bad, about on par with JRPG characters from the 2010’s scaled up to HD. But like every 3D title I’ve seen thus far, the budgeting goes too far and you get choppy animations and poor visual effects. Occasionally an action sequence looked good, but far too rarely to really help the show.In Cagaster’s case, it’s particularly sad because some of the staff that worked on this show are legitimately talented. The direction overall is surprisingly solid, with decent pacing within individual episodes as well. Everything else was sub-par except for maybe the english dub performance, which was acceptable.It’s hard to tell if the manga has the same issues in its narrative, or if the numerous weird little writing issues are from the adaptation. Regardless, while there weren’t any particularly serious issues with the plot, there were a concerning number of small writing errors everywhere. Inconsistent characterization, mild edginess throughout, a lack of proper character development for main guy and an over-reliance on generic sci-fi character motivations all plague the script of this anime.I genuinely like the concept here, even including most of the characters. The execution, which is always key, was lacking for this one, big time. There was legitimate potential for a decent anime here, but between the excessive budgeting and the messy writing, there’s just no recommending this rather interesting but flawed apocalyptic sci-fi to anyone. The manga, perhaps, may have some merit.Directing you to some better apocalyptic anime is actually rather tricky, as I haven’t seen many good ones. If you like chaos, apocalyptic scenarios and fan service, go for my favorite anime called Highschool of the Dead. Gosick is a mystery thriller that, while not in quite the same vein, is similarly structured and also has an excellent, complex narrative. Soul Eater is a high fantasy anime, but if you want a strong narrative with strong lead characters you might consider that one.I’m basically just throwing darts at a board here, since the only anime I’ve seen that was similar to this one was none other than Guilty Crown, a show I personally didn’t care for. You can still try it if you’re brave. As always, good luck with your animu. bad, about on par with JRPG characters from the 2010’s scaled up to HD.

I'm used to having about 100 episodes to have to sum up-- or sometimes twice or three times that amount. And these 24 episodes feel a little oddly placed... But they were pretty good, and a lot of important things happened. I'm not really sure where to start... so I guess I'll just go in order.I really liked that they brought Dawn back for a little adventure with the new gang. Continuing on in Unova, I missed Diamond and Pearl more than I'd expected to. Though that little adventure was brought down a bit by Meloetta... the...Mary-Sue Pokémon. I know Japan has a thing for idols, but she just... annoyed me. This powerful, important, damsel-in-distress legendary that everyone just can't help but fall in love with? Gag me. But the conflict with Meloetta did finally reveal Team Rocket's big plan, which was also... interesting. I mentioned that I liked what they were doing with Team Rocket in the past season-- portraying them as a formidable villain for once, and I was glad to see that come together. But it does feel a little strange that, of all places, in this season that hasn't even been particularly good... this is where Ash finally meets and confronts Giovanni. Who's on a quest to summon the dumbest-looking legendaries this world has ever seen. The episodes were handled quite well, but... I don't know. It just didn't feel right. And I'm wondering where this defeat leaves Team Rocket now. They all went back to Kanto together. Will the writers try to play it off as if their brief success was totally inconsequential and revert Jessie, James, and Meowth back to their usual pathetic selves? (Is it too much to hope that they'll just disappear for good, never to be seen again?)Anyway, as this season reached its midway point, I was fairly pleased. There were a lot of things these 24 episodes did well. I surprised myself by really liking the episodes dedicated to developing Iris. I think she now has the most depth of any Unova character, and my opinion of her might just be softening a bit. And then we moved on to the Unova league and, as with the first conflict of this season, I'm about half and half when it comes to enjoyment.There have been a few things the writers tried to do differently in Unova, and I've approved of most of them. (Especially because lack of originality was one of their biggest shortcomings starting out.) And while I appreciate switching things up a bit... I mean, do I even have to say it? There's a reason you don't write the match against the important rival as the very first qualifying battle of the tournament. I really like how much Trip seems to have grown since their last encounter, but I wish we'd seen a lot more of it. The final battle against the big rival of this season as just a one-on-one match? Not satisfying at all, in my opinion. I just didn't really care about any of Ash's other rivals, so after beating Trip and getting to move on, it was sort of inevitable that whoever he did end up losing to was going to be disappointing. Especially because the writers ended up going with Cameron, who's just stupidly strong. As well as being just stupid, period. Like, his strength does not make sense to me. But I digress...The next season is even shorter, but I think I'm okay with that. Best Wishes redeemed itself a little... But I don't anticipate missing Unova like I missed Sinnoh. The time to move on to X and Y, which I've heard is really good, cannot come soon enough. Mary-Sue Pokémon. I know Japan has a thing for idols, but she just... annoyed me.

(Especially because lack of originality was one of their biggest shortcomings starting out.) And while I appreciate switching things up a bit... I mean, do I even have to say it? There's a reason you don't write the match against the important rival as the very first qualifying battle of the tournament. I really like how much Trip seems to have grown since their last encounter, but I wish we'd seen a lot more of it. The final battle against the big rival of this season as just a one-on-one match? Not satisfying at all, in my opinion. I just didn't really care about any of Ash's other rivals, so after beating Trip and getting to move on, it was sort of inevitable that whoever he did end up losing to was going to be disappointing. Especially because the writers ended up going with Cameron, who's just stupidly strong. As well as being just stupid, period. Like, his strength does not make sense to me. But I digress...The next season is even shorter, but I think I'm okay with that. Best Wishes redeemed itself a little... But I don't anticipate missing Unova like I missed Sinnoh. The time to move on to X and Y, which I've heard is really good, cannot come soon enough."", 'Meloetta arc is what makes this season great. The Unova league part is lame.In English Version, the season ends at Meloetta arc and serves as a season finale where Ash and his friends fight against team rocket. This has only been done in this season and the previous season.A more structured season is made instead of just ending it anywhere. This entire arc is well written and fun to watch. Melloetta is adorable. Piplup and Oshawott are even more adorable.Everything about the league sucks. Ash vs. Trip is a 1v1 battle instead of a full 6v6 battle.New characters are introduced just before the league....One of these characters ends up winning the league. What about all of the characters that worked so hard from the beginning of the series? None of the league battles are memorable. One of these characters ends up winning the league. What about all of the characters that worked so hard from the beginning of the series? None of the league battles are memorable.', 'Pokemon Best Wishes! Season 2 was an interesting ordeal, it focusses on the time after ash has collected 8 of the gymbadges needed to play in the Unova league.Story:Well story wise this part of the show is not much different from the indigo league, Ash participates and does not win once again, after the unova league is over the story shifts to meloetta and was not memorable enough for me to write more about it. Therefore I rate it a 6 for being ok, sticking closely to the pokemon formula but still dabble with some kind of plot arrangement.Art:The art of pokemon in black and...white overall has been better than ever! The move animations stick closely to the game counterparts, even improving upon them! The pokemon look sharp and nicely animated as ever, Ash\'s design is ok, not worse than before but I feel like while he is 10, he looks a lot older in this season. Honnestly would not mind a remake of the original few seasons in this quality... Speaking of which! They show some scenes from the original show, flashbacks, or reminders, which almost seem re-mastered or just made again!Sound:I\'ve got nothing special to say here, the soundtracks are great, if you have been watching pokemon like me, I usually put it on in the background while i\'m doing housework or alike, the soundtrack for me has started to fade into the background in general.Character:Oh boy here we go...I did not particularly like Iris and Cilan to begin with but it just gets worse with this... Yes in at this point in the series you do get to know Iris a little better, like where she\'s from and what her ""goal"" is. Cilan however is just incredibly frustrating, he replaced arguably the best character pokemon had seen, and does so in a smart ass kind of way. I think I\'d like the show more if they just left him out as a main character in general, ash\'s main character-ness has been reduced enough already.And have you noticed how both Iris and Cilan repeat things so many times??? Its more annoying than team rocket ever could have been, and to be honest, team rocket is actually full of character this season cause they are moving up the corporate ladder.Enjoyment:Even though I rated the show a 6, this is purely because of the art improvement. the lack of consistency of the main characters really took a toll on me, hopefully the new mc\'s in X and Y aren\'t as bland. white overall has been better than ever!

Pokemon: Odoru Pokemon Himitsu Kichi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5529/Pokemon__Odoru_Pokemon_Himitsu_Kichi,"['‘The Red Shoes’ was a fairy tale by Hans Andersen, and just like his other stories, it had his characteristic gruesome and morbid imagery. It told the sad tale of a girl, Karen, cursed by an angel with a pair of red shoes that doomed her to dance for all eternity. In her sheer desperation, she asked an executioner to chop off her feet. However, to her horror, the shoes danced before her – with her amputated feet still inside them. She prayed to God, asking for help, but that same angel reappeared…and caused her heart to burst.While no one dies in ‘Pokémon Gotta...Dance’, it too tells the grim tale of beings condemned to dance due to an evil object – the dancing stick.‘Pokémon Gotta Dance’ is, without a doubt, one of the darkest Pokémon shorts. A trio of Whismur get abducted to play maracas for a mob boss. Pikachu polka dances near a cliff’s edge, a step away from certain death. Treecko, visibly in pain, tries to resist the power of the dancing stick, but eventually succumbs to it. And by the end, Meowth muses depressingly that music ruined his life. There might not be much to the plot, but this Pokémon short is one of the very few that did not bore me to tears.It’s obvious that this special was a labor of love from the animators. Colors are bright and cheery, one of the last Pokémon shorts that used traditional hand-painted cels. The scenery is rife with coy references to other Pikachu shorts. Animating all those Pokémon to dance must have been a gargantuan task. Ever wanted to see Meowth and Pikachu tango together? How about Mudkip doing some sick pirouettes? Or Wobbuffet hula dancing – grass skirt and all? Choreography, technique, and performance are on point. Contestants in ‘Dancing with the Stars’ could learn a thing or two from them.I sure hope you liked the second ED in ‘Pokémon Advanced Generation’, because ‘Polka O Dolka’ is played. A lot. Thank God it’s catchy as hell. For anyone who isn’t a Pokémon nerd, this song is an upbeat melody played with xylophones and a shamisen – a traditional three-stringed Japanese instrument. While I did not feel annoyed by its excessive use, I would wholeheartedly understand anyone feeling irritated by the third time around.Recommended to anyone who wants to watch cute Pokémon dancing against their will.

Deep Sea is one of 2 major agent factions that have gone into hiding after a long war to protect humanity (I think it was this) against monsters and/or evil factions. In this academy, Lin Xiaoshuai along with 8 other students compete to get access to Deep Sea's exclusive Gene Lock system that allows users to inherit physical and psychological traits of past legendary agents. Lin Xiaoshuai's parents are missing and he suspects...it has something to with their past lives as agents so he stays in Deep Sea to find answers on their whereabouts.Story: 6/10The story begins with a future scene where Lin Xiaoshuai and 2 comrades fight until a mysterious lady appears and crushes the trio. It then fades away to reveal that the event is 1 year from the actual beginning from the story. I honestly despise this kind of progression because it fuels inspiration to watch it yet spoils the entirety of the story devaluing the events leading up to it. Eventually, I came to terms with that spoiler beginning but it still was annoying to see; the Deep Sea academy is a training arc where Lin Xiaoshuai trains alongside comrades in a virtual training environment until he is ready to set off on missions as an agent.  It's an ok season 1 story but the ending was very violating.Art & Sound: 7/10 & 5/10The art and animation was pretty decent for an older chinese donghua. However, it still suffers with population density and character texture. Sometimes I'm astonished at how good the art and animation is like the opening scene of Deep Sea Academy's underwater headquarters but most of the time it feels like I'm watching a mobile ad because of how poorly textured the characters are. The camera angles this series has also doesn't change it either.Over the rainbow is a recurring audio in the series with the female MC singing it as well as Lin Xiaoshuai listening to it on his earphones. It also plays during the 'real' mission Xiaoshuai and his team are assigned on when he defeats the scarab robot. I don't think this style of music suits the tone of this series; it feels like the song was thrown in it to add emotional attachment but it just deferred it.Character: 6/10I like the characters and how they eventually go from rejecting each other to cooperating and accepting each other like in the virtual mission where Liana is shot on the plane. However, this series has some weird character design: The main character is a high school age yet his character is designed to look like a try-hard shounen character and the female MC Ling is a legit rip of sailor moon with the blonde hair blue eyes foreigner-wearing red tie white shirt Japanese navy uniform in a Chinese donghua. It honestly makes no sense and I don't want to understand the character design decisions but all the characters have a quirky personality and over the top design like Xiaoshuai and Ling.Enjoyment & Overall: 6/10I did enjoy most of the first season; some scenes were filler so of course the rating reflects my personal viewing experience of the series. I've also just finished season 2 of the series and I don't think I'll waste time to submit a review for it - basically it's just a circle jerk of enemy factions trying to capture Xiaoshuai and wanting to have access to the gene lock system Deep Sea has. it has something to with their past lives as agents so he stays in Deep Sea to find answers on their whereabouts.Story: 6/10The story begins with a future scene where Lin Xiaoshuai and 2 comrades fight until a mysterious lady appears and crushes the trio.

MC almost exact replica of Squall only opposite personality.  Children/young adults taken in by some military organization and trained to be secret agents.  Smoking hot,...bombshell of an instructor.  Live combat excercise that involves battling many enemy soldiers and running for lives from a giant mecha spider. All of which happens in FFVIII as well.SpoilerAs enjoyable it was, the story was really lacking in the first season.  It does the usual showing of a future scene in the opening of the season, flashes back 1 year and build up back to that scene by the end of the first season.  Then, End of season. lol  Any answers you had and wanted don't come until the next season.  Of which events then unravel so quickly you get a little lost for a while before you start piecing things together.  Either way, is definitely worth a watch.

Nihon Chinbotsu 2020,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40515/Nihon_Chinbotsu_2020,"[""It’s fitting how this show is called “Japan Sinks”, as my expectations for Japan’s animation industry seemed to sink lower and lower with each passing minute that I viewed this train-wreck.Japan Sinks is undeniably a poor work, but what truly prompted me to fully mull over this cesspool of incompetence and juvenility was how fascinatingly abysmal it truly was. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill Netflix-commissioned anime schlock, this is a show created under the eyes of the renowned Masaaki Yuasa. Science SARU (Masaaki’s own studio), was at the helm here, and while they’ve been fairly hit-or-miss over the past year or so, they also created Devilman:...Crybaby back in 2018, a show that shook the earth (pun intended) with its experimental flare and masterful use of controlled chaos. Many -- including myself -- had high hopes for a similar situation in which culture would be completely shocked, hopefully creating a work as impactful and year-defining as that was. Everything has been lining up to its release, I mean, 2020 is the year of endless possibilities for controlled chaos -- just look out your window. A show as dark in tone as Devilman coupled with a more realistic edge released in a year of actual disasters was clearly a recipe for true success. It would be foolish to wonder “what could go wrong?” in a year that continually proves to be the antithesis of that philosophy, but the answer to that sadly lined up with the established pattern of our beloved 2020.In Japan Sinks, we follow a family throughout a period of seemingly-endless suffering, all triggered by a few gargantuan earthquakes. There’s not much to say about this family, because they’re more so based off of the archetypal roles of a modern family, rather than being real people with genuine motivations and personality traits. This issue is also extended to the numerous friends they meet along the way. Because of this, none of the characters in this character-based show feel real. In a story in which Japan literally sinks, it’s unsurprising that there’s going to be loads of death and destruction, but the way the characters handle all of these incidents proves to be frustratingly alien. Nobody seems to care all that much when a man is blown to bits by a bomb or when a child is brutally crushed by a falling building: they instead tend to grieve for a few minutes, then move on with their comedic-hijinks directly after to lighten the mood. The pace isn’t so rapid and dizzying to send a suffocatingly-bleak message along the lines of: “this is your new reality, people perish like that!, and after that it’s time to move on.” No, far from it. It feels more like the creators were too apprehensive around the idea of fully committing to a despairing atmosphere, so they instead opted for the most extreme version of tonal-whiplash possible. After the first few episodes, we’re clearly shown that these non-characters will be killed off out of nowhere for the sake of creating a dramatic cliffhanger at the end of each episode, so why should the viewer care? They have no unique identities to assume outside of their most basic character descriptors, (Mom. Daughter. E-boy.) and their passings aren’t convincingly grieved over by the rest of the cast, so why should we care?The characters are already bad enough, but even worse are the situations that they’re thrust into. Japan Sinks has to be one of the only one-cour (actually, even less!) shows I’ve seen in which multiple episodes felt like complete filler. It’s hard to understand what the show was going for in the middle portion in which the cast find themselves entangled in a cult, but these episodes completely eradicated any suspension-of-disbelief I attempted to latch onto at first. The show transforms from what seems to be an intimate family drama to a total cluster of tonally-conflicting concepts, truly making you wonder what the show wanted to say. The fact that the most famous YouTuber in all of Japan decides to ride around with this random family after a chance encounter is inadvertently hilarious in and of itself, but are we truly supposed to take that seriously? How much in this show is supposed to be taken seriously at all? The realistic edge I presumed it would have seemed to be absent following the first few episodes, as fantastical elements such as spiritual mediums who can speak to the dead as well as a travel YouTuber a la Logan Paul having a kind heart began to ruin any sense of thematic consistency it started with.Visually, it’s a nightmare. It hurts to say that seeing as Yuasa is one of the most visually-inventive directors in the medium, but it’s the sad truth here. The character designs are fairly basic, yet they rarely seemed to stay on-model, and this was increasingly apparent within the middle segment of the show. It’s clear that a large part of it was outsourced to places it shouldn’t have been, but keyframes are constantly missing nonetheless, which leads to scenes that should be able to deliver some kind of impact falling flat and often airing on the side of hilarity. There’s moments where Yuasa clearly did have his influence with his strange use of color and anatomical fluidity, but they’re few and far between. The messy transitions from these visual peaks back down to the horrific rest of the show harshly broke immersion, and had me promptly recall, “oh, I’m watching Pyeon-Gang again,” every single time. The bitter feeling of squandered potential truly stung in those moments.There’s an awful, awful choice made regarding the voice-acting throughout the entirety of this catastrophe that made this one of the most unintentionally hilarious shows I’ve seen in a long time. In a moment of pure genius during production, someone realized in order to truly immerse the viewer in the cultural-diversity of the cast, (seeing as it follows the aftermath of the 2020 Olympics), characters should shout out miscellaneous phrases in English...usually at the worst possible times. At least this aspect made this train-wreck somewhat entertaining. The son who’s not a fan of Japan and its culture compensates for his disdain by often randomly blurting out Engrish jumbles of words in the middle of horrific moments, like “What the! That is cwazy! No!” anytime anything that could be considered “shocking” occurred. The absolute peak of the show was when he unironically said “live, love, laugh!” like a 50 year old white woman in the midst of what should’ve been a scene of pure emotional catharsis. After that, I was simply waiting for him to screech “bazinga!” after stumbling upon a mutilated corpse. There’s also a stereotypical caricature of an American man who claims to be British despite there being no indication of such being the case, (Well, I mean, I wouldn’t be opposed to distancing myself from America in 2020 either, so I don’t necessarily don’t blame him), and he also speaks in this way, but at least it fits his identity? Ok, well that’s actually no excuse, because he cried out “hasta la vista baby!” during what the show wanted to be a dramatic climax, and I think I lost a solid number of brain cells upon hearing that. Really, what am I supposed to feel throughout all of this? All of these choices are constantly at odds with a story that should’ve fully embraced its tragic circumstances.These are all separate pieces of a puzzle that simply don’t fit together. The vision of the creators is present, but what message does this show actually want to deliver to its audience? During its conclusion, it takes a pseudo-nationalist stance, campaigning for the idea of loving your country no matter what and endlessly supporting them in times of need. Ok. Interesting message (if not somewhat tone-deaf to reality), but where was it for the first eight episodes? Not to mention this message feels shoehorned-in in the most banal, trite way imaginable. The characters are too one-note to get attached to, the timing of both the comedic and disastrous moments are both so poor that they blend in together eventually, and the “inspirational story” backing it all up that should have mitigated a number of these glaring flaws is too flawed in and of itself to take seriously. The fascination that captivated me around this show wasn’t from a source of awe like when pondering Devilman, but instead came from seeing something that had so many things going for it disregard all of that and fail in such a calamitous way. If I, a highly-sensitive crybaby found myself laughing at what should’ve been devilishly disturbing, then you know they messed up on this one. Honestly, the real 2020 disaster was this show's existence itself. Crybaby back in 2018, a show that shook the earth (pun intended) with its experimental flare and masterful use of controlled chaos. Many -- including myself -- had high hopes for a similar situation in which culture would be completely shocked, hopefully creating a work as impactful and year-defining as that was.

The son who’s not a fan of Japan and its culture compensates for his disdain by often randomly blurting out Engrish jumbles of words in the middle of horrific moments, like “What the! That is cwazy! No!” anytime anything that could be considered “shocking” occurred. The absolute peak of the show was when he unironically said “live, love, laugh!” like a 50 year old white woman in the midst of what should’ve been a scene of pure emotional catharsis. After that, I was simply waiting for him to screech “bazinga!” after stumbling upon a mutilated corpse. There’s also a stereotypical caricature of an American man who claims to be British despite there being no indication of such being the case, (Well, I mean, I wouldn’t be opposed to distancing myself from America in 2020 either, so I don’t necessarily don’t blame him), and he also speaks in this way, but at least it fits his identity? Ok, well that’s actually no excuse, because he cried out “hasta la vista baby!” during what the show wanted to be a dramatic climax, and I think I lost a solid number of brain cells upon hearing that. Really, what am I supposed to feel throughout all of this? All of these choices are constantly at odds with a story that should’ve fully embraced its tragic circumstances.These are all separate pieces of a puzzle that simply don’t fit together. The vision of the creators is present, but what message does this show actually want to deliver to its audience? During its conclusion, it takes a pseudo-nationalist stance, campaigning for the idea of loving your country no matter what and endlessly supporting them in times of need. Ok. Interesting message (if not somewhat tone-deaf to reality), but where was it for the first eight episodes? Not to mention this message feels shoehorned-in in the most banal, trite way imaginable. The characters are too one-note to get attached to, the timing of both the comedic and disastrous moments are both so poor that they blend in together eventually, and the “inspirational story” backing it all up that should have mitigated a number of these glaring flaws is too flawed in and of itself to take seriously. The fascination that captivated me around this show wasn’t from a source of awe like when pondering Devilman, but instead came from seeing something that had so many things going for it disregard all of that and fail in such a calamitous way. If I, a highly-sensitive crybaby found myself laughing at what should’ve been devilishly disturbing, then you know they messed up on this one. Honestly, the real 2020 disaster was this show's existence itself."", 'Japan Sinks 2020 - An anime about ""earthquakes"" that start to happen in an uncontrolled way, and can sink Japan, in this dangerous scenario, we accompany a family that so much finds a way to survive in the face of all this chaos.The first thing worth mentioning about ""Japan Sinks 2020"" is how earthquakes are not the main focus of the anime. The notable presence is in the huge variety of subjects discussed all the time about JAPAN. If you came expecting an anime ""about natural disasters"" you were probably disappointed, but this is not the anime\'s fault, it\'s about the expectation created about the...genre. Yes, it is an anime about natural disasters, and the events have consequences, but they serve more as an ornament for the central events of the anime, so much so that the first earthquake happens very quickly (of course, with your degree of concern, put it’s still an earthquake), but throughout the series, what’s really worth noting is how the main characters fit into the allegory that the anime builds.It already begins VERY characteristic when we see both a different hue coming from the central characters, the design as a whole that tends to stand out from the vast majority, nothing has been chosen here. This is all going to be related to the 2020 Olympics that would happen this year, but later on I will get to that. The form and decisions made by the characters are somewhat doubtful, the anime almost always manages to surprise by anticipating the thoughts of the viewer. For example, (Spoiler) the character Kouichirou (Father of the family) who gives the impression that he can be killed by a wild boar, and it does not happen, only to then die by a mine / bomb buried in the ground. This anime at all times shows tiny choices, which can always have big consequences, and this is the anime\'s way of holding us until the end of the series. Already a feature that differentiates it from other animes in this regard, but that does not mean that because it is different, it is good, it could go very wrong, if the anime did not also focus on the visual factor of the world that it created, that if it does in real life, but with its own established rules. The destruction events are very random and with huge consequences, just like the decisions made by the characters, so everything is very connected, and yes, everything works right from what was established.Masaaki Yuasa\'s direction, as always incredible, decides to give a greater brightness to the space where his events occur, and not so much in his characters. Here, different from other of his animations, he focuses more on the amplitude of his scenarios, which besides being very beautiful and detailed, are also frightening and distressing due to the representation of disaster so well achieved. The way the anime is framed reminds me a little ""Tokyo Magnitude 8.0"", that we also have its simplest characters and maybe less animated than it should, but it also focuses on the immensity of the destruction, it creates this real feeling very well that we are in that medium, and tries as hard as possible to represent the situation passed by the characters. But like everything else I said, about anime creating its own reality to talk about its main subject, which is not natural disasters, this is also reflected in scenarios and animation. The scenarios are real, but it is a reality within Japan Sinks 2020, it is not meant to be a situation of almost 100% real destruction as in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, the goal is to help further illustrate events and decisions made by the characters, and the consequences of their acts that are often extreme.This would be the year of the Olympics if it weren\'t for the pandemic problem, and the anime was originally scheduled to be released in October, even closer to the event. We know that an Olympics brings together different people from all over the world, people of different skin, religions, beliefs and everything that our world can provide with differences. Usually, people who do not live in their country of origin tend to create very vague judgments about that place that does not live together, and a lot of anime may reinforce this stereotype, but ""Japan Sinks 2020"" does it differently. Firstly, showing problems that are not widely discussed in other countries, but that actually exist anywhere in the world, as generous actions that are also not very expected, sometimes even cause distrust, showing foreigners in a strange and sometimes strange way. different, but reliable, friendly and heroic too. At all times we can see the anime breaking some stereotypes and using them in its allegory.The goal is to try to generate a concept very close to: ""we are not just what the media shows, or how our image is sold, we have the same problems and quality as you and yet we have our culture"". The anime shows a little resistance all the time of the older and more conservative there are people from other countries. The whole world would meet in the country this year, so this is perhaps an anime more aimed at the ""Japanese"" audience, both foreign characters and other naturalized Japanese but of mixed races tend to be generous with others, and sometimes the opposite too. (Spoiler) The old man at the convenience store who hates foreigners, spectacular scene from Episode 9 where they rhyme and the last minutes of the Final Episode are almost like a ""summary"" that kind of helps to understand a little of this problematic created by anime in a genius way. That\'s why I said at the beginning of the review that the earthquake is not the main focus of the series, but what it does between the lines that is so great.""Japan Sinks 2020"" is an anime with such important moral importance, and above all, making total sense within the world established by itself where it manages to reach its social criticism very well. genre.

Nuances aside, Japan...Sinks 2020 is not only written for amateur viewers, but is directed by an amateur creator, Pyeonggang Heo, who decided to cope with his obvious lack of experience with some truly artless cinema. While the phrase “amateur” can hold many connotations depending on who you’re asking, I personally try my best to use it as modest critique toward aspiring artists with clear potential as opposed to a condescending insult toward the incompetent. From Akira Amemiya to Rie Matsumoto, there’s so many young directors I can name who have more passion and creativity than even they know what to do with, and while anyone could watch something like Kyousou Giga or SSSS.Gridman and jadedly dismiss either one as an unorganized mess, I can’t help but see them as the creative output of geniuses who are simply unpolished in their craft. Unfortunately, I see none of this in Japan Sinks 2020. Heo’s direction feels as book-learned as that of an undergraduate film student, and just in case you had any hopeful reservations regarding Yuasa’s possible involvement, the self-seriousness of the show is absolutely suffocating in a way he would never let fly in a work he had any intimate involvement with whatsoever.A story about barely surviving a cataclysmic natural disaster isn’t the kind of story you’d want or expect to be particularly comedic or upbeat, don’t get me wrong, but there’s still something to be said about letting your audience have a chance to breath with anything other than aimless, themeless, tensionless meandering which populates the entirety of this show not drowned in drama or spent in an obviously destructive cult which the characters should’ve left immediately. This isn’t a high-minded masterpiece like Texhnolyze which actively seeks to smother its viewers in a dreadful tone, it’s simply an obtuse melodrama like Anohana which ascribes to the filmmaking philosophy of Michael Bay, figuring if one explosion gets the theatre roaring, then surely two and a half hours of nonstop explosions can’t possibly get boring! Our melodramatic cast of teenagers, whilst more than justified in their stress, are the same pouting anime characters you’d see in any PG rated drama, and while their struggles are certainly relatable, the manner in which they are relatable is so vast, they come across as being completely manufactured. Desperately worrying for the well being of your family, of your fellow man, of your country, of the direction of your life and aspirations following this catastrophe, or the post traumatic stress any human would undergo. Every problem which any cast member struggles with over the course of the show is so sympathetic as to be utterly impersonal. You’d have to be as much of a fundamental outlier as me to not find such basic humanistic concerns upsetting, and should you actually be as numb to humanity as I am? Then nothing which this story and its characters present to you with teary eyes and ruffled clothes will mean anything to you, and the entire experience will come across as banal normie cry porn at best, and disingenuous mass-market emotional manipulation at worst.My abrasive wordage aside, this show obviously had nothing but good intentions, just little creative means to make me care. If generic melodrama can put you in tears so long as those on screen have the same waterworks streaming down their faces as you do, then you may find this to be surprisingly engaging, but alas, I could not. The problem with seating your narrative’s emotional ties to its audience in genre staples like family and love is when you garner the attention of a misfit who’s estranged from even these basic moral and spiritual values, they’re left with nothing to latch onto. But, hey, that’s a me problem. If I wanted to more fairly criticize Japan Sinks 2020 in a fashion which wasn’t so intensely personal, I could look any direction and be faced with a frankly atrocious animation production. Despite how much I prayed for this nightmare to never find its way into reality, this show ended up being comparable to Hands off the Motion Pictures Club, a show filled to the brim with flat gradients, shadeless coloration, misshapen modeling, progressively barren background art, and clunky animation all-around, all of which was obviously the result of the crunched scheduling they likely put upon themselves by over-producing an unequivocally beautiful first episode, only Japan Sinks 2020 doesn’t even have that gorgeous debut as an excuse and somehow gets even worse, not even touching the visual fidelity of Science SARU’s previous Netflix commission, Devilman: Crybaby, which itself was blemished with a fair amount of inconsistency and cost-cutting as well. And speaking of which, Kensuke Ushio returned to compose the score, and while his sound will always be beautiful, it is becoming very repetitive, and I’d challenge anyone to try and differentiate any ambient track herein from those of Koe no Katachi or Liz and the Blue Bird, standouts notwithstanding.I expected inconsistency to be the name of the game, but what I didn’t expect was having to witness these enthusiasts of personalized artistic stylization resort to some truly garish CGI in absence of the time or manpower to consistently hand-draw vehicles, nor did I expect this show to be worth calling ugly as early as episode three. While I appreciate the fact this show continues Masaaki Yuasa and Eunyoung Choi’s commitment to experimental animation direction, even if I think the messy line-work is a bit much, I think the design team on this project ultimately took it one step too far with the character designs, and more specifically, the facial designs. Variation in facial animation has always been a thing in the industry, and whether someone like Hiroyuki Okiura is using the unshakable attention to detail and unmatched production values of Production IG to do it with photorealistic blinking and lip definition, or whether Yuasa himself is unapologetically taking advantage of the awesomely exaggerated Taiyo Matsumoto art style over the course of his entire career, variation in facial structures is nothing new. However, no matter how famous the creative lead, sometimes a misguided, poorly practiced, or downright bad production will leave such experimentation without unanimous praise. That’s right, if you thought Isao Takahata’s dimples in Only Yesterday were jarring, then nothing in this world will prepare you for the hideous yet hilarious neck rolls in Japan Sinks 2020. Needless to say, it is quite difficult to take the sorrows of these characters seriously when you can barely even look them in the eyes without their neck lines distracting you from the matters at hand, and even if you find this critique to be as dumb as it sounds, the atrocious animation will still do your immersion no favors. I mean, clunky key animation, missing in-betweens, and off-model artwork made even an attempted rape scene laughable.Thrashing the production values is righteous enough when they’re this pitiful, but I fully recognize my thematic complaints are as personal as my cinematic complaints are unfair. Japan Sinks 2020 will leave you with the same uninspired emotions any other half-baked disaster movie ever has, but the fact it can leave you with any feelings at all speaks to its passable writing at the very least, and while the essence of the story will tread no new water, conclude in an astronomically corny and outlandish fashion I didn’t even afford myself time to discuss, and even alienate you should you be as desensitized to human nature as I am, it will still pander to the average viewer’s average emotions and make them feel something as opposed to nothing. While Yuasa’s position as Chief Director gets more and more set in stone in the face of his recently announced departure from Science SARU, director Heo isn’t inept, and while you’ll certainly be missing the cinematography of the master, his understudy here won’t disappoint anyone with adjusted expectations. And while the neck rolls, by far the stupidest of my critique, will remain as disgusting and discomforting to look at as the rest of the show already is, they will also remain completely in the eye of the beholder. This story of a family fighting against an unfair fate is your typical headline of tragedy not complicated by a villain or thematic challenge which is only newsworthy thanks to its ability to reassure the bleeding-heart normies they can continue to live on without feeling the guilt of the unfortunate, so if the fact the cast is, indeed, a picturesque and politically correct family of four is enough to invest you in their artless narrative despite the fact they’re cardboard cutouts who are scribbled onto the screen uglier than roadkill, then just know you have my jealousy. ""Normieness is next to godliness,"" as a wise man once said, and I’m going straight to hell.Thank you for reading.

Therefore I'm gonna try judging this series as fair as I can.Earthquakes are scary. The Japanese society, culture, and many other aspects of the nation has been affected by Japan throughout the history and creation of Japan. This anime is another disaster earthquake anime in which Japan gets hit by a giant earthquake and many, many people die. At least that's what it seems like it was like until it turned into some crackheads appearing every...episode.Story - 3/10Nothing worse than a badly done, over the top unrealistic story which they tried making realistic. All of Japan sinking? At least try keeping it realistic to a certain point! On the other hand, this anime does a mediocre/good job of portraying survivor's guilt and other psychological problems. I am going to pretend I never saw it become a fiery bullsh** because it seems as if I can't put negatives down.Art - 6/10Drawing and animating is really hard work. The art in this anime would have been really good if done correctly. You could see parts from time to time in the art and animation that was off. Animating building collapsing and humans getting crushed and twisted realistically is also very hard, making the animation more clunky and off.Sound - 5/10I'm not an expert in this stuff but I'm gonna try. The intro was average... just average. The sound effects were good. Everything was fine except one thing. English. I don't know about you but personally I hate it when the English is pronounced really badly over and over and over.Character - 4/10They honestly did a pretty good job with the characters. Or maybe since everything else was so bad, it looked better. Either way, they did a great job portraying the psychological effects on the characters.Enjoyment - 5/10Did I enjoy it? The answer is Yesen't.Overall - 4/10Honestly, the story might have been good and they could have done better.Do I recommend this anime? I honestly recommend the first 3 or 4 episodes. Then the series just burned, got mauled, feel off a cliff, hit a landmine, blown to shreds, and then yea you get the point. episode.Story - 3/10Nothing worse than a badly done, over the top unrealistic story which they tried making realistic.

I stumbled upon the trailer of this anime on YouTube and thought it looked fantastic. I was really looking forward to it but now I can honestly say this was my biggest disappointment after watching any piece of media in my life. Yes, it was that horrid.The funny thing is the first two episodes were quite good with great animation and art. Then, it just went south after that to a point where I was just lost for words. The tonal shift was so abrupt and jarring. The quality of animation dipped so badly some scenes looked like it...was animated at 5 fps. Characters never had any real development and deaths were completely pointless and for shock value.The worst part of all of this is that many scenes were unintentionally funny. The broken engrish between characters on top of an abrupt tonal shift made this a funny watch indeed. I would’ve given this a higher score had it keep that kind unintentional satirical humor but no the show switched gears dragged itself towards the finish line. It was like a train wreck, a bad car crash that you can’t help but look despite being absolutely repulsed by it.It was a miserable experience. was animated at 5 fps.

I would’ve given this a higher score had it keep that kind unintentional satirical humor but no the show switched gears dragged itself towards the finish line. It was like a train wreck, a bad car crash that you can’t help but look despite being absolutely repulsed by it.It was a miserable experience.', 'TLTR; it\'s the worst Yuasa\'s work without any doubt.Oh man... I remember how much I was waiting for this anime to finally air, Yuasa\'s last work as a member of Science Saru, how can we not be hyped? It took 2 episodes to let that hype...sink (sorry).-First of all, what the hell? Seriously, this was supposed to convey any sort of emotion? It looked like a ""Final Destination"" rip-off where chaos after chaos occurred and NONE of the characters gave a shit about, SPOILER ALERT! My dad died? let\'s keep walking! One of the girls almost got raped? No problem! If the characters themselves...don\'t seem to care, why should we?- I couldn\'t stop laughing my ass off when that mini arc about the religious sect, how many topics do you wanna cover? it was so dreadful and had literally 0 impact in the rest of the series, what was even the point?. Oh, and they inserted a 15 seconds sex scene and people smoking joints to ""make it more mature"" o justify the +16 on Netflix.- I won\'t extend this much more, it\'s easy to say that art-wise this was very bland for Science Saru/Yuasa\'s standards and the OST was forgettable at best.WAIT, almost forgot, THE GODDAMN ENGRISH, the lil boy speaking english mid-sentence was stupid, unnecesary and it hurt my eardrums.That\'s it. don\'t seem to care, why should we?- I couldn\'t stop laughing my ass off when that mini arc about the religious sect, how many topics do you wanna cover? it was so dreadful and had literally 0 impact in the rest of the series, what was even the point?.

An ordinary family tries its best to survive as a series of earthquakes destroy the islands of Japan. It shows their struggle while moving up west and how the city continues to tremble and cause more damage. Even with this the family continues to make memories with each other on their way. I think this story is a real eye open to appreciate whats happening in the moment because you never know what the future brings or who you’ll gain and lose in life.Art 6/10For me the characters styles...are bland. For the most of it their drawn okay but they could of definitely been better designed. Like in most series the backgrounds are drawn wonderfully. I found that a lot of the frames went from being well drawn to just awful, some times it was hard to look at it because of how bad it was. It’s understandable from occasion because a lot of work goes into animating but I feel like it’s constantly seen throughout the series.Sound 8-9/10The music in the series is definitely emotional, for me whenever I hear the music I always think of a silent voice, after looking up the composer I found out that it is the same for this series and a silent voice.i found that the music for both is very similar. For some people this could be a downside for the resembles which I understand a lot but even with that it still sets the scene and brings the emotion.Characters 6-7/10In this series there is a nice range of characters even for side characters of the show. Ayumu is a character who seems to have a hard time to adjust to the situation which is happening around her, unlike other characters in the series she seem to keep a lot of morals like how she didn’t want to steal any food or clothing from the shops. I think there is a strong development in her as the story goes along as she goes through more pain she continues to stay strong.Her farther is shown to be a very strong character, he takes on the role to protect his family *spoiler * until he comes to his fateful end * end of spoiler*. The same goes for their mother, she is also another strong hearted character who does what she can for her family, whenever I saw her she always reminded me of a Disney princess who didn’t need to be saved by a prince.Ayumus brother go is also a strong point to their family, through his character it shows the events happening through younger eyes, he’s often protected from seeing a lot of the darker things that happen in the show but even with that he’s mature and isn’t petty like I’d imagine younger characters being like.The honorable mentions for side characters would be the ones you see the most of like Daniel, koga, kaito and kunio. There character are well scripted and gives us another insight of their emotions and beliefs for the situation at hand.Enjoyment 7/10Compared to a lot of summer animes so far I’ve enjoyed this a lot. Right from episode 1 this series has been very entertaining, unlike the rest it’s a full release and we don’t have to wait every week to see the next episode. For me the biggest downsides of this show are some poorly scripted scene and animation but if you can look past that and see the good elements of the show I think it is something most people would enjoy. I think for me at least it will be a series I’d like to re visit again in the future.Overall 7/10I’d definitely recommend anyone to watch this if you have Netflix (or if you can find it else where) it’s definitely one of the better series that they have on, with its unique compelling story people will definitely be hooked on it from the start. it’s packed with a lot of emotion scene in it which you can easily emphasise with the characters, I managed to cry a lot during some episodes even with being a not very emotion person. I always think shows are usually good when they can bring home the emotion even if they are not the best scripted or animated.As a note I noticed on Netflix that the series was rated 15 which I can somewhat agree to disagree on. I found that some scene in this series seemed to be suited for a mature audience of probably +16 but I could be totally wrong. are bland.

The first two episodes were an exercise in good story-telling and great character building. It was off to a fantastic start. And then starting from EP3, I'm still not sure what happened, it was just pathetic.Every single character just decided to become a psychopath with the empathy of a rock. I've never seen a quality drop like this in any show ever. It's just truly upsetting watching this show play out. No superlative I use here will be enough.But you know what? Watch this show. Just watch from EP1 to EP5 to...get a sense of how bad something can be. get a sense of how bad something can be."", ""A show that marketed around Yuasa's name that has nothing to do with Yuasa's works and his brilliant direction, let alone writing.The amount of disdain I ended up having when I finished the last episode kind of forced me to make a review just to share with the world how disappointed I am with studio SARU and Yuasa in general. They could have easily skipped all episodes except the first one and the last two and nothing would have changed. Actually, I probably would have enjoyed this show more.From the mastermind behind PPTA, The Tatami Galaxy, Devilman CRYBABY, and so on and so forth...we are getting this absolute pile of dregs? Absolutely senseless.I won't delve into the specifics because the show doesn't even warrant a thorough analysis and/or discussion. They wasted all the budget on the first episode which is actually a quite decent one. After that everything goes south, unfortunately.The music is somehow bad, tracks don't match the scenes and feel anonymous and without charisma.Characters are cardboard placeholders, they die like flies, sacrificed on the altar of Shock Effect. They don't even care about each other, not even when they are blood-related or long time friends, they just move on because whoever wrote them is terrible at his job and should probably be fired.And then there's Daniel. I have no idea who thought that having a buffoon running around with not even lame jokes but annoying lines was a good idea.For some reason, we have a gamer kid who spends half of his screen time talking in English. And this is where most of my enjoyment of this trainwreck (or shipwreck, given the series) comes from: people doing or saying dumb shit.I cannot for the life of me care about the protagonists when the scene is completely ruined, each fucking time, with some weird English line thrown around to make it cooler.The main theme was a sci-fi cataclysmic disaster that is basically left to rot until the last episode to have a senseless ending thrown together to give some kind of... closure? They also waste entire episodes with filler stuff that doesn't have a place in this kind of work. And when you feel you are wasting time with filler episodes in a 10-ep series, you know something is seriously messed up.The story as a whole is terrible. Its main premise is thrown away after the first 2 episodes, random stuff happens, and then we get LE PROFOUND SOCIAL CRITIQUE that has the same depth of a puddle. Yes, nationalism bad, but also proud Japanese people have gone through worse and will muddle through this shit too. Great social commentary guys, I feel enlightened.Whenever they try to adapt a novel that was written in the past (1973 to be precise) while trying to modernize it by making it take place in the 2020 (the same thing that happened with Parasyte and because of that they fucked that adaptation too), weirdly enough they fail hard.Pretty sure Yuasa had nothing to do with the series as a whole, perhaps some brief supervision, and maybe he was the reason behind the incredibly cringe, vomit-inducing rap dubstep scene during the second-to-last episode, since we know he loves these kinds of things. we are getting this absolute pile of dregs?

People die and we are given less time to take in those moments.The best thing about this show is its music, Oh that good old soothing music.Sadness and sadness and misery is all we get to see, reminding me of Titanic.I don't know why...but this series felt kind of unoriginal to me, i kept finding similarities to many show/movies.

Despite the catastrophically negative reception among friends and the similarly dismal scores the show has, I still had hope that it could be at least entertaining in some regard. Even an Inuyashiki tier “so bad it’s good” title would’ve been enough to be satisfying, if still ultimately bizarre given how this is treated as a Yuasa work...more on that later. Unfortunately, this ONA is just an abject failure...in almost all regards, and outside of some moments in the second half, is a dull and frustrating slog.If we’re going to start anywhere, might as well do so at the visuals to get some things out of the way. The name “Masaaki Yuasa” most certainly got thousands to check this show out, as he’s one of the most acclaimed directors of the 2010s for his work on hits such as Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong The Animation. Unfortunately, it’s a name that isn’t as baked into the show as with most other titles he is involved with, as Korean first-time director Pyeonggang Heo was the series director. Needless to say, it really shows when the only other credit Yuasa had for this show was storyboarding for 4 episodes. Those episodes have a few genuinely nice shots, even if they aren’t anything special by his standards. However, even in those episodes, the artwork in this show can be rough, to put it generously. While there are moments that look nice, such as when two characters are playing fighting games or when one of the characters is in a dream sequence that looks like an MMORPG, the show’s main art style is generally unappealing, The artwork rarely stays on model, and it all just comes off like a discount Devilman Crybaby. The animation often feels incredibly choppy, and that’s when it doesn’t become a slideshow or otherwise feel standard at best. For the first half of the show, there is almost no awful CGI outside of some of the water in the show, but that’s not exactly praise, now is it? Then we get to the second half where the already subpar production plummets below the earth’s surface. There are a few decent shots with our characters at sea in episode 8, but the artwork consistently dips through the floor and is where most of the meme screenshots come from. The abysmal CGI grows more rampant by the episode and the choppy visuals get even more stilted. The slideshow moments and other cost-cutting techniques increase as well, indicating that in an already likely outsourced production, the latter half received considerably less attention and time than the first half. Science SARU is still listed as the production studio for this show, but this is a far cry from even their less visually stable works prior to this.The production values are far from the only baffling thing about the show. There’s a disturbing number of scenes where I don’t know that the aim of them being there was apart from filling time. The lack of handling regarding the show’s tone further accentuates the issue, as I generally don’t even know how I’m supposed to feel during most scenes. I get the idea of the show being how one must persevere and have hope in the face of adversity as that’s the only way to get through. However, it just feels like characters have no time to grieve and instead just become happy go lucky mere moments later, forgetting about any trauma entirely. Immediately after one of the main characters dies in the second episode, the third is just everyone walking while being slightly mopey. Whenever someone dies in episode 8, the survivors get sad for less than a minute before riding off in a motorboat while someone screams “LET’S GO CRAZYYYYYYYYY” in glorious Engrish, and upbeat electronic music plays. This is followed up by a rap battle, by the way. It doesn’t feel like the characters are lifting their spirits organically, and more like death is never a lasting consequence on anyone’s psyches or mood outside of one character moping on occasion. As a result, it’s difficult for these deaths to stick as impactful for the audience either. It doesn’t help when episodes just start introducing off the wall concepts and plotlines out of nowhere like when our characters are enveloped into a cult or when a bunch of people are having a mexican standoff over a vault of gold where a medium between life and death pulls out a katana on everyone. Are we supposed to take this show seriously and address the supposedly realistic elements like characters scavenging for food and water, or go with these fantastical concepts and ignore things like the MC receiving a laceration on her leg until it’s convenient for the plot to make her stumble? By the time an old man started 360 no-scoping people on a wheelchair with a bow and arrow, I stopped being sure about anything anymore.Yes, this show’s writing and structuring are abysmal, and that’s not even the half of it. Even outside of the aforementioned example, the show is so absurdly contrived that in the first episode, we get an out of nowhere plane failure that coincidentally happened alongside the earthquake, and the convenient path of colored trees the main lead and her mom found afterwards that let them know the dad was alive without us being given any reason at the time to assume there was any correlation. This is just so they can have complications and then meet up. In episode 3, poison gas coming out of the ground is sprouted for that scene only, and it’s so they can unceremoniously kill off and immediately replace a character that was close to our main leads with a Youtuber. Japan Sinks also pulls a Devilman Crybaby and introduces cliffhangers for shock value and then immediately disarming them or forgetting about them at the start of the next, rendering them entirely pointless. After instilling a somber yet hopeful tone for the last few minutes, episode 1 decides to end on a random helicopter crashing as bloodied corpses fall from the sky and onto a bunch of civilians, including our main characters. Episode 3 has it even worse, with one of our main characters getting shot in the heart area where his gaming handheld is. In the first 2 minutes of the very next episode, they pull it out of the gadget and all that happened to him was that he hurt his head a little and needs his green PS Vita repaired. Perhaps even more insulting than all of that is something I’ve never seen any piece of media do until now. Whenever a character is dying or a building related to them is crumbling, we’re given flashback dialogue in order to manipulate the audience into feeling for a character’s death or the destruction of something related to them when often times, this is the first we’ve even learned anything about why these people and places are special. The only exceptions are the deaths of two characters in 8 and 9 where we learn things about them in advance, only to still get these verbal flashbacks. Oh, but don’t you worry. You’ll get your precious visual flashbacks in the 20 minute epilogue 10 minutes into the finale. Hope you don’t mind all the slideshows and how most of the time, we probably could have been shown things about the characters’ pasts and attempts to grieve rather than told about them several episodes later! Enjoy the endless suffering as you barely know what’s going on, why certain characters are here, why things are even happening, or why you should even care about any of these characters beyond half of them being family members and some of them just being sometimes kind people! It’s not like character establishment is important and that several scenes in the first half could have actually expanded on the characters and dynamics beyond the shallowest of traits!Oh yeah, that’s right. We should probably talk about the characters now. Ayumu is our main lead. She’s a daughter, one who whines sometimes and gives people water only to be taken advantage of. There’s not much to her beyond that outside of being the stupidest motherfucker to ever get a cut that never hurts until she needs to be crippled for a moment. She never examines or tries to treat it even after working at a hospital in the middle of the show, and no one else seems to notice the pretty deep wound she has until moments before the epilogue. You’d be surprised how much that can get under a viewer’s skin for 10 episodes, which, I remind you, is the show’s entire run time. She gets into arguments with her mom in conversations that resemble a toddler saying “I hate you” to her mom and the mom parroting it to shove the kid’s childishness back at them. The dialogue barely even feels human or genuine, doubly so when random Engrish is plastered onto tense scenes all the time. Speaking of the mom, we have Mari. She’s dependable and has her own secrets, making her the most complex character in the show, for what little that’s worth. She sometimes feels like she has genuine human interactions. I don’t know why there’s a track star turned NEET named Haruo here outside of the fact that they need a character to develop in the middle of the show, as forced, out of nowhere, unearned, and immediate as it is. There’s also the son, Go, who hates Japan and blurts English phrases. That’s about it for him. I guess there are other characters such as the pragmatic YouTuber (KITE) who ends up being probably the best character, but outside of him and the survivalist dad, just about no one else matters or is worth talking about. There are less than 5 scenes where characters have genuine and charming interactions to make them seem remotely fleshed out and alive. There’s virtually nothing to them, and almost no redeeming qualities about some of them, including the worst/main character, Ayumu. As the eight deadly words of TV Tropes go: “I do not care what happens to these people.”I guess the least awful aspect of the show is the music. I needed some faint semblance of positivity before losing my mind, so I’ll say that the opening sequence was a nice and tender song. Kensuke Ushio’s OST has some decent ambient tracks to convey a sense of emergency or tragedy, even if they aren’t particularly memorable. The episode 10 ED isn’t absurdly terrible...oh wait, that’s it.Japan Sinks 2020 might be the worst work with Yuasa’s name on it, and a crushing directorial debut for Pyeonggang Heo. What went wrong here?! Was there not enough time for Yuasa to do any more hands-on work or for episodes to get refined visually? What happened here? Did the writers not have a decent understanding of how to adapt the 1973 novel of the same name while modernizing it? Either way, what we got was a disastrous waste that will probably be but a miserable footnote for Yuasa and the industry in the coming years. Oh God, I didn’t even talk about the gaudy rape attempts or the shark scene. I didn’t even talk about the “That’s a video gamer for you” line which ranks up there with FLCL Progressive’s “tsundere routine” line as one of the worst pieces of dialogue I’ve ever heard, either! Jesus, this show sucks! in almost all regards, and outside of some moments in the second half, is a dull and frustrating slog.If we’re going to start anywhere, might as well do so at the visuals to get some things out of the way.

It’s not like character establishment is important and that several scenes in the first half could have actually expanded on the characters and dynamics beyond the shallowest of traits!Oh yeah, that’s right. We should probably talk about the characters now. Ayumu is our main lead. She’s a daughter, one who whines sometimes and gives people water only to be taken advantage of. There’s not much to her beyond that outside of being the stupidest motherfucker to ever get a cut that never hurts until she needs to be crippled for a moment. She never examines or tries to treat it even after working at a hospital in the middle of the show, and no one else seems to notice the pretty deep wound she has until moments before the epilogue. You’d be surprised how much that can get under a viewer’s skin for 10 episodes, which, I remind you, is the show’s entire run time. She gets into arguments with her mom in conversations that resemble a toddler saying “I hate you” to her mom and the mom parroting it to shove the kid’s childishness back at them. The dialogue barely even feels human or genuine, doubly so when random Engrish is plastered onto tense scenes all the time. Speaking of the mom, we have Mari. She’s dependable and has her own secrets, making her the most complex character in the show, for what little that’s worth. She sometimes feels like she has genuine human interactions. I don’t know why there’s a track star turned NEET named Haruo here outside of the fact that they need a character to develop in the middle of the show, as forced, out of nowhere, unearned, and immediate as it is. There’s also the son, Go, who hates Japan and blurts English phrases. That’s about it for him. I guess there are other characters such as the pragmatic YouTuber (KITE) who ends up being probably the best character, but outside of him and the survivalist dad, just about no one else matters or is worth talking about. There are less than 5 scenes where characters have genuine and charming interactions to make them seem remotely fleshed out and alive. There’s virtually nothing to them, and almost no redeeming qualities about some of them, including the worst/main character, Ayumu. As the eight deadly words of TV Tropes go: “I do not care what happens to these people.”I guess the least awful aspect of the show is the music. I needed some faint semblance of positivity before losing my mind, so I’ll say that the opening sequence was a nice and tender song. Kensuke Ushio’s OST has some decent ambient tracks to convey a sense of emergency or tragedy, even if they aren’t particularly memorable. The episode 10 ED isn’t absurdly terrible...oh wait, that’s it.Japan Sinks 2020 might be the worst work with Yuasa’s name on it, and a crushing directorial debut for Pyeonggang Heo. What went wrong here?! Was there not enough time for Yuasa to do any more hands-on work or for episodes to get refined visually? What happened here? Did the writers not have a decent understanding of how to adapt the 1973 novel of the same name while modernizing it? Either way, what we got was a disastrous waste that will probably be but a miserable footnote for Yuasa and the industry in the coming years. Oh God, I didn’t even talk about the gaudy rape attempts or the shark scene. I didn’t even talk about the “That’s a video gamer for you” line which ranks up there with FLCL Progressive’s “tsundere routine” line as one of the worst pieces of dialogue I’ve ever heard, either! Jesus, this show sucks!', ""Stay away from reviews that told you the director of this masterpiece is a bad director ! They probably don't understand a thing about it !From the same director of devilman crybaby and keep your hands of eizuken, this is the newest anime (jul 2020) of masaaki and heo ( ping pong, death note and durarara). Nihon chinbotsu is an anime that always keep your heart at your mouth! Every episode makes you waiting for the worst and the best at the same time !Every speak and action has a meaning and a consequence.All the characters are well built, we care and cheer...for them, there's no evil or good. They are just motivated by their history,the environment and their believes.Art is not the best one , but it's used wisely. It show's the horror of the landscape and characters.The music is there, but is not something magnificent, it don't add to the anime.A masterpiece of direction you must watch ! for them, there's no evil or good.

It show's the horror of the landscape and characters.The music is there, but is not something magnificent, it don't add to the anime.A masterpiece of direction you must watch !"", 'Okay, so like what the frick?Imma just dive in real quick, spoilers are ahead, you’re warned. This show gets a 3/10.Story: Please stoooopIt’s just one of these stories that jumps from one accidental occurrence to another. Like every step just feels random. Oh, a hidden mine field? Guess someone has to die. Let’s put toxic gas here, haha another one bites the dust. Uh, a city that is for no reason not damaged by sinking Japan? Not anymore, let’s kill all the citizens. But before that let’s party and pretend like Japans just fine.Yeah, another thing, you might realize. Every episode there has to die...at least one character cause I guess that’s fun. It’s like in one of the last episodes, no one had died yet and they had restored important knowledge in a sd card or sth. The brother held the chip in his hands and let it slip. Maaan, nobody had died in a long time, let’s make one of the characters retrieve the card while dying in the process. Sure. It just takes the shock and drama out of people dying. It’s just used to remind you that Japan in fact is sinking and it’s not the adventurous journey of a random group of people through Japan.. Sure people die when there’s a disaster but they don’t die in patterns. The deaths didn’t feel written in a natural way but forced.Also about this Japan sinks thing. Like nobody saw it coming but this random scientist. And he knows like every detail of when which part and where Japan is supposed to sink and also when it’s supposed to pop up again. Sure, there is only this one person in this whole universe that saw it coming and also can predict Japans future. Maybe it’s his doing..Last thing: mood swings. Like is this show trying to be a happy adventure like ‚yeah Japan sinks, let’s paaarty‘ or does it want to be a bloody, dramatic piece of weirdness. In one moment everyone’s crying and dying and in the next they have a rap battle about equality. Like literally, I’m not even lying.P.S. the plot is freaking predictable. The mc cuts her leg like in the first episode and doesn’t get it treated - why are you so stupid just talk to people. I was just rolling my eyes like boy it will get infected, she will lose her leg. Congrats, she did!Characters:These characters are so unlikeable and unrelatable. They feel so unreal and behave like they’re on their period the entire show. How am I supposed to get emotional? That’s it, there’s nothing left to say.The conversations feel so unorganic like two apathetic potatoes would talk to each other. And the urge to take photos of everything? Like boy, Japan is sinking and you have nothing better to do than to take a photo? Wait, maybe that’s the only behavior that’s making sense.Also there is a scene, where the cast joins a dude with a car. The dude is being a horrible jerk and forces himself on one of the ladies, the others kick him, steal his car and leave him behind. I guess one character even said something like ,That felt good‘. Wtf, human decency, anybody? Tie this jerk up and take him or put him somewhere where he gets a chance to survive? No, let’s kick him, steal his car, feel good about it and leave him to die while the country goes down.Art:It’s decent most of the time but sometimes the characters have like these creepingly big swollen hands and warped faces.Sound:Sometimes nice, most of it was forgettable.Overall:This anime dragged itself and made me wonder why I watched it. I loved Devilman Crybaby directed by Yuasa, Masaaki and I had hopes that he would manage to direct something nice again but boy was I wrong. The idea of having a disaster and putting a cast into it can totally work but rather than the show telling about a disaster it was one itself. Sad thing tho, it wasn’t the kind of bad where you go ,it’s so bad, I can actually enjoy it‘. It was just bad. at least one character cause I guess that’s fun.

There is a nice range of characters but they always felt off. the kid is always saying some english shit which adds nothing to the story and just feels way too out of place. their fucking dad dies and after two scenes everything is back to normal like their dad never existed. There is no reference to his dad whatsoever. there is no emotional harm done except for our main girl who doesn't show it after said two scenes....These people are not people. These people are not people."", 'This is a spoiler-free Review!Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 is not an anime about a disaster, it\'s a disaster anime!Let\'s start with the FAQIs this show similar to -Tokyo Magnitude 8.0?- - Yes, they both have earthquakes here and there, and  obviously some tragedies occur here and there, but that\'s basically all the similarities there. In terms of quality, Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 is simply - Awful - and if you haven\'t seen both of them, I\'d recommend watching -Tokyo Magnitude 8.0?- over this abomination - 100 times out of 100.1)Art - 1/10From the get-go you realize that the art isn\'t the strongest point of...this anime. There are lots of scenes where the scenery and people just hold still. You\'re basically watching a very poorly made drawing for up to 5 seconds, while listening to some background noises, or characters talking. Many of these ""people"" are basically sketches an elementary-school student would draw better.In some scenes there\'s literally copy/paste Photoshoped elements of the environment, such as damaged  cars,  barrels and so on. It\'s painful to the eyes and makes you wonder whether the creators of this show had a very low budget to work with, or whether they were simply too lazy to give a better effort! I\'d say that both are true here.2)Animation - 2/10Perhaps just as bad as the art, but there are several moments when you feel that the animators made an effort not to make the scenes downright pathetic. Still, the animation is so abysmal that sometimes you\'d want to cry. I can\'t still forget one moment for example, when a landslide began while the characters drive away in the car. The animators basically used CUT option from paint and sliced off a part of the drawing of the mountain and simply dragged that perfectly sliced piece down - to leave an impression that the landslide happened and the hill is going down!In the scenes when the vehicles are moving, you are left with desire to throw up - it\'s just that bad.Oh god...Throughout the series you\'ll be asking yourself if this show was made by amateurs, a lot. Perhaps my overall score would have risen if i knew that this show was a school project and some inexperienced children made it with very limited resources available to them. Sadly, that\'s not the case.When it comes to art and animation, I, and a lot of other people are eager to forgive the show if the plot and characters are decent at least. Are they?3)Characters - 3/10No...The characters in this show are incredibly cliche, boring, undeveloped and quite often - downright annoying.3 out of 10 might be too generous, but still, i\'ll give credit where it\'s due. There are moments when certain characters actually resemble human beings and act like them. 3 female characters, in particular the MC, certain girl -Nanami, and the mother, as well as the father, are the only characters i sometimes felt sympathy towards and could relate to and feel sorry for them.The rest of the cast, that consists of 5+ characters do nothing but ruin the mood of the show, are forgettable and too fictional to make you feel anything for them.4)Story - 2/10Oh boy...Here we go.So the story, as the title explains, is about Japan going to the bottom of the ocean. It\'s your typical disaster/apocalypse story where we follow certain characters, see their struggle and how they overcome certain obstacles and change personalities when making decisions. With the poorly-made main characters out of the way, we have the world to deal with, and sadly it\'s filled with every possible cliche imaginable related to this genre.We have rapists, anarchists, awfully bad people who forgot about morals and decency the moment the quakes began and act like animals, racists, supremacists, cultists - you name it!Typical for a poorly scripted story, it\'s filled with conveniences and characters being incredibly lucky, especially towards the end.The reason I still give this abomination a 3/10 is that the start of the show was somewhat intriguing and the ending of the ending has a message about ""what it is to be a citizen of a certain nation"", ""what it is to be a human"", ""why acceptance is important"", ""why it\'s important not to cling to the past and keep moving forward"". The final message kind of redeems the episode to a certain degree, but sadly that\'s not even remotely enough to redeem the whole show.Honestly, in the end i was left with an impression that the author knew how to start and end the show, but didn\'t know what to do with the 90% of the story in-between the start and finish, thus they/he/she filled it with random shenanigans that makes no sense and is basically a -waste of time!- I\'m talking about a certain arc in the middle of the show that made me want to drop the series, several times.When it comes to the whole ""will Japan sink one day?"" theory; I personally have doubts that it can submerge underwater in just a couple of days! I\'ve read a certain manga that involves a similar scenario, but the outcome, even though it was just as apocalyptic and world-shattering, was much different and realistic. -Dragon Head-What makes Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 a terrible story? - The poor execution! Quite often you will be asking yourself ""what the heck am i watching?!"" Randomness of certain events completely ruin the atmosphere of the show and makes you distance yourself from the characters and the plot. Considering that the art, animation and characters are awful, there is very little that keeps you attached to the show and i barely watched it to the end, considering dropping it at least 8 times - and the series consists only of 10 episodes!5)Sound/voice acting and soundtracks - 4/104 - meaning decent, but not mediocre. At least something was done right. The sounds and voice acting was done the best in the show, even though there\'s not much to be proud of. There is a lot of ""Engrish"" spoken in the show that annoyed me a lot, but overall it still sounds the way an average Japanese person would sound when speaking in English, so that\'s that.When it comes to music, I always soften up a little. I can\'t just ignore the fact that there are at least 3 soundtracks in the show that are good, and I liked them. Usually, having a decent soundtrack is enough reason for me to give +1 or more points to the overall score of the show, no matter how terrible it might be. So congratulations to the sound team.6)Enjoyment - 2/10As you most likely guessed, I didn\'t enjoy the show. There really is not much to enjoy in it, and i mean I\'ve read and seen a lot of disaster/post-apocalypse books/movies/anime/manga and by far this was the worst experience for me. Certainly would recommend avoiding it like a plague, unless you\'re, like myself, obsessed with this genre and has already seen everything else. For this very reason that i love this genre, i forced myself to watch this atrocity to the end, and overall, I\'ve decided to give this show a-3 out of 10- in the end.1 for the genre, 1 for the soundtracks, 1 for the drama and how certain characters made me feel something other than disgust.Thank you for baring with me to the end! this anime.

However, in all aspects this series still managed to fall terribly short of what I would consider a shred of hope compared to any of the series I'v e seen. In short, Tokyo Sinks 2020 is an poorly structured, lack of common sense based story with unnecessary character bloodshed.The members of the Mutou family deaths are used to add shock factor when the story runs dry of action or intense internal conflict. All the characters lack general cognitive problem solving capabilities and judge...their situation leading to a pile of dead characters that slowly accumulate as new characters are introduced.TL;DR Not worth the watch, too illogical and lazy plot progression & character development.Story: 4/10There are a large amount of plot holes that weren't cleared up as the story progressed, most likely due to the continuous chronological events. The story  was too ambitious and tried to cram a lot of content in 10 episodes which was such an unsatisfying experience. When the story was on track about the sinking of Tokyo, it became interesting but content addressing that was like finding a needle in a haystack. Almost all the events that occurred throughout the story were irrelevant to get the ending anyway which made the filler content redundant.Art & Sound: 5/10Most likely one of the worst Netflix anime art & animation I've seen to date and I think I am generous to make it inclusive to anime licensed out by Netflix. If you froze an action sequence, you'd understand the depth of detail maintained in the character design in Tokyo Sinks 2020 - It looks like a completely ripped/rotoscoped style of design. The faces, body structure and even color palette of these characters were in the form of a webcomic/webtoon which I wasn't expecting, maybe the budget dropped mid production and inbetween animators were on a crunch to pump out the series in time for the deadline. Generally, the art style is garbage but the animation fluidity wasn't 'bad'.Sound was an average, nothing spectacular.Character: 2/10It terrible I can think of over 10 supporting characters that were blatantly killed off to add shock value to the series. The deaths ranged from digging in a minefield, drowning (x2) to being shot because of a stray bullet on a boat because a passenger panicked and falling to their deaths.  Character development was this series worst notable aspect out of all the aspects because they were excessive and as the story progressed the deaths became insensitive. Adjusting to the characters dying became easy since the cliffhanger of most of the episodes involved characters dying or on deaths door which made it an unbearable watch.Also, Dr. Onodera is underrated; his persistence made the show bearable because his predictions were accurate.Enjoyment: 1/10Waste of time, This series was simply overhyped from the beginning if the characters were fated to die how they did.Overall: 4/10 their situation leading to a pile of dead characters that slowly accumulate as new characters are introduced.TL;DR Not worth the watch, too illogical and lazy plot progression & character development.Story: 4/10There are a large amount of plot holes that weren't cleared up as the story progressed, most likely due to the continuous chronological events.

This roughness and imperfection are what makes it good.Pros:- A lot of people are writing about unrealistic characters and their reactions. I can\'t agree with that at all. It\'s really common to be seemingly in high spirits after a death of...a person close to you, to joke and smile a lot etc., especially when you\'re in such a stressful situation. It\'s just a protective mechanism, you know, so you don\'t lose your mind with grief immediately. Scenes like the one where mom was cutting Ayumu\'s hair show that in such situations people deal with grief later.- The same can be said about characters. Yeah, people IRL are often annoying, cheesy, cringey, they make stupid jokes all the time, insult each other, are being insufferable weaboos like Go, get into unnecessary arguments with their parents or children, show their worst side when faced with extreme situations and so on. But they also help each other, genuinely love each other, overcome the difficulties and grow. I think the show mostly managed to portray both of these sides well.- I\'m pretty empathetic and can sympathize with characters even in really generic shows, but the impact is not the same every time. Some deaths in this anime were a bit forced or didn\'t happen at the right moment to have the necessary impact, some made me really sad, and Mari\'s death actually made me cry a lot. I don\'t cry at every even remotely sad scene in every anime I watch, but I can\'t just shrug off children trying to save their mother with all their strength, and I don\'t give a crap about the fact that it\'s generic, has been done a thousand times everywhere, cheesy, badly animated etc.Cons:- A lot of plot conveniences, not going to argue about this one. But as long as I still cared about the characters, it\'s fine. I guess I could describe the characters as mostly realistic and the plot as mostly unrealistic (excluding sudden stupid deaths, that\'s not really unrealistic, you could expect that in every disaster).- Yeah, it\'s really predictable most of the time, like the moment Ayumu\'s leg was infected you could guess that she would have it amputated and then perform at the Olympics with a prosthetic in the last episode. Or you could easily predict how Haruo will die. It\'s not necessarily a bad thing. A good show doesn\'t have to be completely unpredictable, it could be just good old predictable things that are done right and still have impact.- Some things felt like they were really just there for shock value, like the scene where seagulls are eating the fisherman\'s body was good and emotional enough, but the shark after that was really unnecessary. It broke the mood sometimes, but as I said most of the deaths ranged from okay to really strong and emotional to me.Overall: solid 8/10 for me. It\'s fairly predictable show about simple people and simple things. Yeah, Japanese culture like any other culture deserves to be protected and remembered. Yeah, people often have conflicting beliefs and world views but they can achieve great things if they overcome it. Yeah, we go through a lot of sadness and pain in our lives, but if we live through it all, it will probably help us grow. So what is so bad about the anime that tells about these things in kinda generic but emotional and impactful way? Ah, yeah, ""ugly animation"", lol. a person close to you, to joke and smile a lot etc., especially when you\'re in such a stressful situation. It\'s just a protective mechanism, you know, so you don\'t lose your mind with grief immediately. Scenes like the one where mom was cutting Ayumu\'s hair show that in such situations people deal with grief later.- The same can be said about characters. Yeah, people IRL are often annoying, cheesy, cringey, they make stupid jokes all the time, insult each other, are being insufferable weaboos like Go, get into unnecessary arguments with their parents or children, show their worst side when faced with extreme situations and so on. But they also help each other, genuinely love each other, overcome the difficulties and grow. I think the show mostly managed to portray both of these sides well.- I\'m pretty empathetic and can sympathize with characters even in really generic shows, but the impact is not the same every time. Some deaths in this anime were a bit forced or didn\'t happen at the right moment to have the necessary impact, some made me really sad, and Mari\'s death actually made me cry a lot. I don\'t cry at every even remotely sad scene in every anime I watch, but I can\'t just shrug off children trying to save their mother with all their strength, and I don\'t give a crap about the fact that it\'s generic, has been done a thousand times everywhere, cheesy, badly animated etc.Cons:- A lot of plot conveniences, not going to argue about this one. But as long as I still cared about the characters, it\'s fine. I guess I could describe the characters as mostly realistic and the plot as mostly unrealistic (excluding sudden stupid deaths, that\'s not really unrealistic, you could expect that in every disaster).- Yeah, it\'s really predictable most of the time, like the moment Ayumu\'s leg was infected you could guess that she would have it amputated and then perform at the Olympics with a prosthetic in the last episode. Or you could easily predict how Haruo will die. It\'s not necessarily a bad thing. A good show doesn\'t have to be completely unpredictable, it could be just good old predictable things that are done right and still have impact.- Some things felt like they were really just there for shock value, like the scene where seagulls are eating the fisherman\'s body was good and emotional enough, but the shark after that was really unnecessary.

So what is so bad about the anime that tells about these things in kinda generic but emotional and impactful way? Ah, yeah, ""ugly animation"", lol.', 'Japan Sinks 2020 has a lot of hype behind it. It’s an adaptation of a seminal disaster novel from 1973, updated to modern day by Masaaki Yuasa and his studio Science Saru. This is the same team that struck lightning by similarly updating the classic Devilman manga into the now-just-as-classic Devilman Crybaby, and Japan Sinks 2020 very much feels like it wants to recapture that magic. Here, again, is a ten-episode Netflix Original anime series with moments of intense violence and sex. Here, again, is a modernization of an old classic that diversifies the cast with all different skin types and nationalities, making extensive use...of modern digital technology. Here, again, is composer Kensuke Ushio, turning in a very similar dark synth electronica soundtrack to the one he graced Crybaby with. Here, again, are characters who run track and field, with running and passing the baton both very prevalent motifs. There’s even a scene late in the series where the characters engage in a rap battle. This series wants to repeat the success of Devilman Crybaby so badly it’s palpable.But there’s one critical difference that sets Japan Sinks apart: Yuasa isn’t the series director. That role falls to Pyeonggang Heo, making his directorial debut after a handful of episode directing credits across the past decade or so. The scriptwriter as well is different, trading veteran Ichiro Okouchi for the incredibly inexperienced Toshio Yoshitaka. I didn’t discover this information until after I finished this series, but in retrospect, it makes sense.Because that’s the only explanation I have for why Japan Sinks 2020 is just as big a disaster as the one it’s named after.The story starts out well enough: Japan, nation of earthquakes, is hit with its biggest one ever. Over the course of the first episode, we follow four individual family members as they find their way to each other across the city of Tokyo. It’s actually a pretty clever structure, as we’re not told why these four people are important until they start reuniting and we realize they’re all part of the same family, so we’re allowed to be introduced to them organically. But once they’re all together, the news drops: this earthquake is only the first. Japan is going to be rocked by seismic activity until the entire island nation sinks under the Pacific Ocean. And with most of the airport runways already rendered unusable, the entire population of Japan is left scrambling to find a way to safety. Thus, the Mutou family- dad, mom, older sister, younger brother, and a couple of neighbors- sets off to find a way off Japan before the whole thing goes under. Along the way, they run into all sorts of colorful characters and odd scenarios, lots of people die, and everything very quickly starts to fall apart. And unfortunately, the “everything” in that last statement refers to far more than Japan itself.The issues start cropping up early once the death toll starts to rack up. I won’t bother spoiling who lives or dies (or tells your story), but it becomes clear very quickly that this series has no idea how to handle death. One of the family members is gruesomely killed right in front of the others, and it takes about six minutes for them to go back to acting like nothing’s happened. This will become a depressingly common occurrence as the show goes on. Someone dies, or something awful happens, there’s a moment of horror as our central cast reacts to it, and then they’re back to wacky hijinks in the next scene. No one in this show acts like they’re in a crisis situation; it feels like they’re just on a very long, very nonsensical road trip. Maybe the attempt was to try and lean into those road-trip sensibilities and just be a sightseeing tour of interesting people and places with the disaster as a backdrop, but it’s still so wedded to the reality of that disaster in its realistic presentation that the tonal whiplash becomes exhausting. You end up staring slack-jawed as these characters bumble through unnatural situation after unnatural situation, wondering why nobody’s reacting in anything close to resembling human pathos.But things only get worse from there, as this show quickly reveals itself to have one of the most haphazard, unfocused plots I think I’ve ever seen. The story careens back and forth between completely unrelated concepts, tossing in ideas out of nowhere just to wipe them away in the very next moment. One moment we’re in a survival road trip scenario, the next we’re spending three episodes living in an Earth Mother cult while an old geezer in a wheelchair infiltrates a high-security complex with 360 no-scope bow-and-arrow shooting. No, you didn’t misread that, there is an old geezer in a wheelchair who shoots arrows at armed guards while spinning. What, and I cannot stress this enough, the fuck. Forget breaking suspension of disbelief, this is so utterly moronic it just about shatters the concept of disbelief itself. And the show just keeps tossing weird shit in with no buildup and expecting you to accept it. There’s a weird foreigner who somehow makes his eyes and ears bulge out like he’s doing magic tricks. How? Never explained. Why is there a random sex scene with the cult leader and her husband? Never explained. Why is there a random bank robbery involving two characters we’ve never met before and both die pretty much right after? Never explained. How the fuck is this cult leader somehow capable of actually speaking to the dead? Never explained. Why do so many characters just choose to stay behind and die despite having perfectly usable means of escape within reach? This isn’t even a case of not enough room in the boats or whatever, they could have easily survived with no ill effects. They just decide, nope, I’m cool with being crushed to death in the most ecological disaster of human history.It is shocking how poorly thought out this entire show is. Nobody acts like a real person, nobody reacts like a real person, and every decision just makes less and less sense, to the point where I started slapping my forehead in stunned disbelief. One character gets a nasty cut on her leg and doesn’t bandage it for the entire show, despite having plenty of opportunities to do so. It ends up getting infected and turns into a big plot point, and none of it would’ve happened if she had just fucking grabbed some random piece of cloth and covered herself like someone with more than one brain cell. A famous Youtuber shows up out of nowhere and decides to pal around with this family for some unknown reason, which immediately gets their minds of watching yet another close friend die before their eyes. There’s an attempted rape scene that has no effect on anyone and could’ve been completely cut without changing anything. Characters find out information just because with no forethought or foreshadowing. There’s this whole running subplot about a mad scientist and his paraplegic partner who somehow predicted this disaster, but it’s so poorly explained that it feels like it belongs in an entirely different show. And seriously, take a step back and look at this rap sheet. Natural disasters, cults with actual magic, mad scientists with secret mountain labs, and fucking parachuting Youtubers? There is no consistency to this show’s world, and it doesn’t have the slightest idea what kind of tone it wants to set. The final episodes try to tie a neat little bow on things with this big montage about the Japanese people and the character of the nation, but if this show was supposed to be about the concept of Japan, then it owes Japan an apology for depicting it so fucking nonsensically.Even more frustratingly, not even the technical merits are enough to distract from how godawful the script it. There are moments of great animation in Yuasa’s traditional loose and flowing style, but most of the time this show just looks ugly outside of the gorgeous backgrounds. Characters are constantly off model, facial expression warp and distort to inhuman shapes, so many key frames are dropped to the point where it looks like the characters are teleporting every other step at times, and there is no consistency to the blocking or editing of scenes. This is why I’m inclined to place the blame more on Heo than Yuasa, because the directing is just flat-out abysmal. There’s no shape to scenes or moments; they just come and go at random intervals, cutting off shots at the most awkward moments and randomly panning the camera across the screen with no consideration to what would best highlight the emotions of the scene. It’s a cluttered, unfocused, often confusing mess, and most of the scenes trying to be dramatic are instead rendered comical by unnatural dialogue, grotesque parodies of human movement and expression, and a complete inability to grasp the concept of dramatic timing. The one consistently excellent part of this show is Ushio’s score, and even that’s treated with so little consideration and precision that it all starts melding together into audio soup that makes the already unfocused scenes even more chaotic and tonally confused.Japan Sinks 2020 is an unmitigated fucking trainwreck. For all the talent and pedigree behind it, it just keeps making the most wrongheaded, counterproductive choices over and over again until it suffocates itself. It’s the kind of show you don’t so much watch as gape at, wondering how any functioning human being could’ve possibly thought this would work. It almost feels like storytelling by Mad Libs, but at least Mad Libs is funny and random on purpose. This show wants to be a profound artistic statement to be Taken Seriously(tm), and that only makes its baffling incompetence all the more infuriating. If you’re eager for a “family survives an earthquake” anime, just go watch Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. That show is ten thousand times the show Japan Sinks 2020 will ever be. of modern digital technology.

Many parts of the story are quickly thrown in just to thrown out (people falling from the sky).The anime tries to add many themes (culture, family, earthquakes); however, with only 10 episodes there was no way to expand on these themes so it all becomes a convoluted story.Murphy's law was also in play in this anime. Characters quickly introduced would be just as quickly killed off.Art (5):Sometimes the animation becomes...terrible and laughable. The art style is similar to other shows from Science SARU such as Ping Pong the Animation.Sound (7):Some OSTs were really good, however I feel some were out of place. Cheerful music would be used after a character dies and serious scenes throwing off the mood of the scene.Character (5):Some of the characters were really annoying and their motives were confusing.Go, one of the main protagonists would keep throwing in random English words in his speech, sounding like cringe weeaboos using Japanese words like desu, senpai.Ayumu another protagonist was also annoying always complaining about something.Kite, the number 1 YouTuber suddenly decides to join the protagonists without ever knowing knowing the reason why.Haruo was one edgy kid who barely talks in the anime, having a sudden change of personality half-way through the anime.Enjoyment (3):I spent a good amount of time laughing at this anime, despite it supposedly being serious. I couldn't take it seriously as I did not feel any emotional attachment to the one dimensional characters.Overall (3):If you turn your brain off and do not take it too seriously you'll enjoy it. I should've dropped it after episode 3, but it was so bad I had to keep watching it to see where the ending would go. terrible and laughable.

I should've dropped it after episode 3, but it was so bad I had to keep watching it to see where the ending would go."", 'You won\'t get bored with this anime, but the arguments, the lack of emotions in some crucial points of the story, the unreal behavior of the people makes you think ""Why am I watching this?""The characters are really bad constructed, and as I said before, they do not react as a human being when for example dies someone close to them. It is really painful to watch that moments.I liked the art, not my style, but it\'s good to get out of the routine sometimes. The sound is normal, nothing amazing. And at least the story is crap, I didn\'t like it at all. ', 'I really don\'t know how to describe this without including the words ""What the hell was that?""(Spoilers in this review) Japan Sinks: 2020 had a standard premise, which if built upon right could make a solid story. Disaster hits, individuals deal with losing loved ones. And this is what happened, for maybe the first two or 3 episodes.To begin, the story of this show was all over the place. It jumped from the city, to the countryside, to some sort of cult camp, to the coast, in the ocean for a while, and then they are saved. I can understand the choices of...losing loved ones throughout their journey, but these deaths felt empty, and inconsequential. Some of the characters, (I\'m looking at you, mother) had absolutely NO reaction to the death of her own husband for several episodes, for the reason that ""you must repress your emotions."" Yeah, uh no, that is not how emotions work. This, along with so many other reactions to similar deaths, made the characters feel hollow, but I\'ll touch upon that later. The story somehow manages to have an entire third of the show be filler, with our group living in some cult. (what else could it be?) They stay they for a stint of time, acting as if their lives are not in grave danger because the ground they literally stand on is at risk of collapsing at any time. After this the story takes a 180, with now the number one priority being to save the crippled doctor\'s research, which is apparently important? And somehow everything turns out okay, ignoring that 3 quarters of the cast died.Discussing art, the quality of the character design and animation is barely watchable at best, and completely illegible at worst. This ONA has none of the charm of the artstyle of so many anime, replacing it with crude drawings with no real character. Sound in this is something that is very skipped upon, looking back. Sound, and in turn music, helps to set the scene for plot points, such as deaths or moments of joy. Japan Sinks fails to meet the mark for many of the deaths, with no buildup at all to them.The characters in this are absolutely godawful. I don\'t have the next week of my life to go into depth on all of them but I will try to touch upon the most important points in my view. So many of the character deaths in this show are pointless. The mother, who they ALL know has a heart condition, volunteered to dive underwater to get their boat free? Dead. The guy with the hat and glasses, who was literally IMPALED with a piece of metal, who after it was wrapped up and specifically told NOT to mess with it, up and running and grabbing things fine, no problem. The daughter, who cut her leg on what I can guess is some metal, NEVER had the thought to, you know, CLEAN the wound maybe? Bandage it? The daughter here must be mentally disabled or something, specifically when her and her brother were in the lifeboat just floating in the ocean, they saw the man they were with literally eaten and taken away by a shark, and you know what she did literally days, if not hours later? Just stuck her head underwater to look under the lifeboat, not a care in the world. The only slightly redeeming character is the son, who is kind of a gigachad.Overall, this show is something like a trainwreck in motion. It\'s terrible and you should look away, but you keep watching to see how bad it could possibly be. I would not recommend this to anyone to be honest, there are several other disaster anime that one could watch and get much more enjoyment out of. losing loved ones throughout their journey, but these deaths felt empty, and inconsequential.

I would not recommend this to anyone to be honest, there are several other disaster anime that one could watch and get much more enjoyment out of.', ""Minor spoilers ahead, but let's be honest, you won't care to read this review if you are actually planning on watching this show. TL;DR further down.Short rant:So! Japan sinks 2020 wasn't short of a dreadful mess of a story that was awfully put together, where even in the first episode I was already quite sure how the rest of the anime would play out.(But I somehow still managed to finish the show, which I will give them a bonus point for(JK not really)From a weird cut in the first 10 minutes of the episode to not explaining anything about that what could have...possibly happened until 7 or 8~ episodes later which was, let's be honest, really half-assed.(The mother is apparently a really good swimmer that can avoid a tsunami but struggles to keep her breathe for more than 20 seconds in a later episode, and have the plot armor stronger than any of your typical Isekai MC's)Story: 3Here is why I somehow enjoyed it, I love this kind of genre, but this was extremely poorly executed. It just all felt so random, I couldn't feel a flow of what was going on with it, each episode was quite decently set up structure wise, but the story was just weird, random and somewhat confusing.Art: 3From CTRL C CTRL V trees in the 2nd episode to 3 framed blurry scenes and shaking effects to very off-putting CGI (I can usually tolerate a bit of CGI) it wasn't looking very good for the art part.Though, I do quite enjoy the way it is drawn, from having certain scenes being quite stunning to a 7-8 score but then having other scenes being barely a 2 and more close to a 1, especially when it was the majority of the show. It did end up bringing the score down for me.Sound: 5I actually enjoyed the OP song quite a lot, melancholy feeling I guess, and the 2nd episodes ED was very well used. Though it was the only two memorable things with the sound for me.Rest of voice acting it was quite fine, I can't really judge it too well though as I am not fluent in Japanese. And I think that most is to blame on the director for it either way.Other than that I can't say that I am too impressed with the sound but not disappointed either.Characters: 1Here is the biggest flaw for me, AWFUL character development and design.The characters are not short from being as unrealistic as possible, I couldn't relate to any of them.The constant thrown in English was so painful to hear. I GET IT, KID! YOU ARE A GAMER! (The young brother is a HC Gamer)The biggest issue I had with the show was the characters reaction to loss, I couldn't understand any of their reasoning or reactions at all. They are faced with absolutely terrifying things you'd expect to see in a extremely dark and tragic show (which catastrophic shows should have) this was actually quite extreme in my opinion, but not in a bad way honestly... IF IT WASN'T FOR HOW THE CHARACTERS JUST DIDN'T CARE.Second episode in an we get to witness a main character to the family go game end, yet it is as if nothing happened. CMON! There is blood and gore even, yet it doesn't feel like we get to see any of their emotions from it.Yes we all experience tragedy differently but this just for some reason seems like the most unrealistic take they could have used.Enjoyment: 4Yes, the show isn't good, and far from perfect.BUT it did have it's moments, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. As I said previously it is one of my favorite genres.Overall: 3It wasn't good, it was hard to enjoy it without sometimes even outright sigh at what I was watching.I wouldn't even recommend this to someone if they did have time to watch something, but either way it just boils down to my opinion, I can already see that a lot of people enjoy this show quite a lot. So don't take my word for it and watch it if you really want to!TL;DR:It's bad, other shows have done this way better in my opinion, like Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, where I actually got really emotional compared to this where I feel like I should have been more affected because of the horrifying scenes they have in it, but in the end I wasn't.Make up your own mind and watch it though if you really, (Like really really really) want to. Otherwise I'd pass this one! possibly happened until 7 or 8~ episodes later which was, let's be honest, really half-assed.(The mother is apparently a really good swimmer that can avoid a tsunami but struggles to keep her breathe for more than 20 seconds in a later episode, and have the plot armor stronger than any of your typical Isekai MC's)Story: 3Here is why I somehow enjoyed it, I love this kind of genre, but this was extremely poorly executed. It just all felt so random, I couldn't feel a flow of what was going on with it, each episode was quite decently set up structure wise, but the story was just weird, random and somewhat confusing.Art: 3From CTRL C CTRL V trees in the 2nd episode to 3 framed blurry scenes and shaking effects to very off-putting CGI (I can usually tolerate a bit of CGI) it wasn't looking very good for the art part.Though, I do quite enjoy the way it is drawn, from having certain scenes being quite stunning to a 7-8 score but then having other scenes being barely a 2 and more close to a 1, especially when it was the majority of the show. It did end up bringing the score down for me.Sound: 5I actually enjoyed the OP song quite a lot, melancholy feeling I guess, and the 2nd episodes ED was very well used. Though it was the only two memorable things with the sound for me.Rest of voice acting it was quite fine, I can't really judge it too well though as I am not fluent in Japanese. And I think that most is to blame on the director for it either way.Other than that I can't say that I am too impressed with the sound but not disappointed either.Characters: 1Here is the biggest flaw for me, AWFUL character development and design.The characters are not short from being as unrealistic as possible, I couldn't relate to any of them.The constant thrown in English was so painful to hear. I GET IT, KID! YOU ARE A GAMER!

Literally 90% of these are wrong.I suggest watching this for yourself to experience what it's like to truly persevere through any situation no matter the disability you have.This was an amazing short series that no matter what was thrown at them they knew in order to keep going they had to move on. If anything these characters have a strong will to survive. The cultural and political inputs that were made in the series gave us a glimpse of what the creator shows what it's like to be a mixed or foreigner in Japan and their view of the nation as...well as how Japanese view their ideologies.. They also added some modern elements as the kid loves e sports and youtube, which I don't know why any one would find that cringe when in this day in age that's a pretty popular thing lol. This is a show about a human resilience and a lot of these air head elitists missed that. well as how Japanese view their ideologies..

I\'m not going to pretend that I\'ve had my fair share of any. People have been through far worse than I could ever comprehend. Yet, I get by. I know it\'s an arrogant thing to say, but it\'s the truth. Everyday I ignore all the bad things that happen in the greater world. Wars, poverty, depravity and death. I compartmentalize, I tell myself that the bad things aren\'t happening to me. These things exist, and there will be people to overcome those adversities when they inevitably knock on their doors. But what happens when you can\'t run away? What happens when it\'s...time to face the music? What happens when those doors come crashing down, and your whole life along with it?I just binged Japan Sinks: 2020 (JS), here are my thoughts. This review will be mostly spoiler-free, but feel free to check out my Tl;Dr if you wish to go in blind. Also, I\'ll be referencing Devilman Crybaby quite a bit, as I feel that both stories showing up in director Masaaki Yuasa\'s filmography and their thematic parallels are too important to ignore in this review.8 minutes. That\'s all the reprieve you get. During this time we meet the Mutou family, the characters whom we\'ll be experiencing this journey with. Ayumu, the family\'s 14 year old daughter, is a track-and-field athlete and the anchor for an upcoming meet. Her mother Mari is on a plane about to land at Haneda Airport. Kouchiro is the breadwinner, working his day job in construction. The son, Go, is an epic gamer with his bright eyes set on the future. Set in present-day Japan, life goes on the way you\'d expect: the unremarkable hubbub of daily life ensues. Even when the first earthquake hits, most of the populace remain undeterred. People pull out their smartphones and break into excited discussion, as if some mere celebrity scandal got Trending on Twitter. In a place where earthquakes and other natural disasters are almost commonplace, life goes on as usual.Here\'s the thing about earthquakes: the first wave isn\'t the most dangerous part. It\'s the aftershocks that hit the hardest. After 8 minutes, all hell breaks loose throughout Japan.If it hasn\'t been made apparent by this point, JS is not a show for the faint of heart. The island country is rumored to sink underwater from tumultuous seismic activity, and the scale of this threat looms large in every episode. The elements are a ticking time bomb for Ayumu and her family, as they race to find an escape from the chaos. The Mutou\'s race against time is powerful and devastating; the tension had me tugging at my hair on multiple occasions. Science SARU\'s latest outing looks surprisingly grounded (this isn\'t a pun I SWEAR), and this change from Yuasa\'s signature art style is fitting for what the show is going for. JS looks detailed and immaculate, with painstakingly well-crafted imagery of the ravaged cities and countryside. But occasionally his idiosyncratic free-flowing animation and pronounced facial expressions find their way into the show, wringing every bit of emotion from several big scenes. Former Yuasa collaborator Kensuke Ushio scores the show and complements those moments with both tense and soft pieces. These elements form a medley in service of hitting me with some of the most devastating moments I have ever experienced in my time with anime. I won\'t go as far as to say the show is pure nightmare fuel, my momma didn\'t raise a wuss. However, what I watched felt uncompromising and honest in its depiction. It\'s not just gratuitous torture porn for four hours, but rather a fully immersive experience which pulls me under the weight of such a disaster.Audio flashbacks are played at several points in the show. Wildly at odds with the havoc taking place, these monologues serve to demonstrate where the show\'s real focus lies. JS, while dark, is a tale about human nature. The show unflinchingly puts humanity front-and-center. Conflict in JS can easily go from the external to more inward. It captures people with a variety of ideologies and goes to lengths to show several ways people respond to the world shattering around them. Much like ""Devilman Crybaby,"" JS isn\'t afraid to show the depraved places people can go to under adverse situations. But while Devilman\'s take on these ideas were nihilistic, JS acknowledges this capacity for immorality and responds with hope. Even amidst despair, we are given glimpses of this hope. The capacity for kindness, perseverance and love. Tears and loss make their way into many key moments, but they allow for each small victory that follows to mean so much more. Tragedy hits hard, yet it\'s often punctuated by brilliant showcases of resilience. JS pulls at your heart and fills it up again. It was a tiring experience binging this, but also one made worth it by that hope.JS is not short of pitfalls, and those faults (I really need to stop with the puns) do make this amazing work a tad harder to sit through. The first big issue that would affect your watch is, as I said before, the disturbing imagery and content. While purposeful, it can be really hard to stomach at times, especially during the few instances the show goes unnecessarily overboard. This ties into my next qualm, which is that of doing things for shock value. Some scenes feel like jump-scares and leave far weaker an impression than so many of the carefully built-up climaxes. JS can also be pretty frustrating with its cliffhangers, and there\'s one or two I found particularly frustrating. Not just \'cause they were cliffhangers, but because the story could have functioned perfectly fine without them. I also find that certain elements regarding the sorrow in the show could have been portrayed better. For starters, I know the score is superb, but maybe don\'t blast hype Devilman Crybaby music over characters dying? Also, how characters react to some of these deaths feel somewhat disjointed. We don\'t get a whole lot of grieving in between these moments, which then come across like mere plot points that need to be checked. Saving the worst for last, probably the biggest complaint I could lodge against the show would be its middle stretch of episodes. Our main characters don\'t have much to do in that arc, and it felt like a footnote happening behind the scenes instead of incidents I deeply cared about.Tl;Dr: Japan Sinks: 2020 is not easy to watch. Suffering and loss, amplified with strong visuals and sound design, permeate the show throughout the journey. JS holds no punches demonstrating the massive scale of such a disaster. But when I watched the show end I wasn\'t thinking about the earthquake. I was thinking of what we do when the bad things happen. And what we humans do is carry on. There are still things to learn, people to love, futures to strive towards. The human spirit has gotten us through troubles time and time again. There\'s no stopping what we can achieve, not even if you take the ground away from our feet. 7/10~STRAY RAMBLINGS (SPOILERS):- A small disclaimer: I\'m not all clear on exactly how much of the show as a whole I can attribute to Yuasa. He\'s a co-director in the project and I\'m not clear on how much creative influence he had. But the parallels between JS and Devilman Crybaby seem pretty clear in my eyes, which is why I felt it was right to make those comparisons.- Yuasa\'s adaptation in Devilman Crybaby added the running motif to the original story. Seems like he\'s a big fan of track, \'cause he brought it back here.- In Ep 2 the date shows 18 Sep 2020 on the KITE\'s Youtube video where Okinawa sinks. Fingers crossed that this year doesn\'t get any worse :sWhy do they keep making Go speak English every now and then? I kinda see the point, but speaking basic English doesn\'t make you more of an epic gamer or anything.- As detailed as the backgrounds are, the characters don\'t look dirty enough in most scenes. I know I sound like a nitpicking prick but it kinda takes me out of it when a disaster of such scale is occurring and their clothes look like they\'re fresh out of the dryer.- Smoking in a gas station is straight-up dumb, no two ways about it.- Ayumu needed to get her leg checked out like, 30 mins into the show.- I was super scared for some weird shit to go down when I saw dance lights in Ep 5. We all know what happened the last time Yuasa did a scene in that setting…- Credit where credit is due, the Shan City subplot is interesting on paper. Ultimately pointless however, Ep 6 is so far removed from the rest of the show. The stuff that went down felt really pointless, I didn\'t care that much for it.- That photo motif breaks my heart. Almost every time a pic is taken, it spells death for a character. Breaking out that Polaroid only got more painful the further into the show.- KITE became a V-Tuber. Absolute legend.- The first episode is probably my favorite. It told the entire story of the show in 20 minutes. The setup before the incident was expertly done, with the most impactful detail being that of Ayumu\'s track partner making an unfulfilled promise to our anchor runner. I got chills down my spine.- BEST GIRL: I don\'t wanna, not for this show :\'(- Thanks so much for making it this far! I apologize if the review isn\'t completely up to stuff, I usually take more time to prepare. Penning this review was an enriching experience, and I look forward to doing more in future.

It's not perfect as they could have made some things better and Ayumu less annoying but too sad this website is full of Edgelords the ironic thing is that everyone talk about how the animation is trash but the yare the same ones that simp over Devilman Crybaby, made by the same studio with the same style and even same director and EVEN same OST composer, what a joke. :) i recommand to peoples to give it a try instead of listening the edgelords bellow. "", 'I just want to start by saying that the intent of this review is not to justify the score I have given Japan Sinks, but to discuss why I think that many have under-appreciated it. I think the show is very good and one of the better things I watched this year, though with very noticeable flaws. However, I think people have over-emphasized these flaws in order to justify their opinion of it, while demonstrating an inability to engage with the show more deeply so that\'s what I want to talk about.Let\'s start with politics. A full discussion of the role in politics would be...too large to fit in a post like this and different literature critique philosophies emphasize politics at different levels. All stories revolve around a character who has to make an impact on the world or develop in a particular direction and this process is an inherently political one. We may not agree with the conclusions offered by the creators, but we judge the work by how well it formulates the discussion, not by how much it aligns with our personal beliefs. Some people have disliked Japan Sinks believing it to be too ""SJW"", but I would ask that such people don\'t stop their critique there and move on: explore how the show portrays its ideas and what arguments for change it sets forth.The Japan Sinks franchise started as a novel in a post-war, boom economy 1970\'s amid massive cultural shifts, from an imperialistic war-focused country to one that embraced technology, many Western values, and structural changes. This left a large cultural rift between generations. The original book, according to some accounts, invited the reader on a search to find a national identity and the 2020 anime continues that dialogue from a more modern perspective. where youths are increasingly globalist and contemptuous of traditionalist values and the elderly  remain disdainful of foreign powers. These ideas merge with Yuasa\'s philosophy as expressed in Mind Game as all being beside the point: what matters in life is your drive, ambition, and the joy of doing what you love, not where you\'re from or where you\'re going.The characters of Japan Sinks are reserved and preoccupied. Their ideals and philosophies are constantly at odds with the harsh world surrounding them and there is very little time to process what has happened before the next catastrophe strikes. They are constantly hungry, tired, and dehydrated and the show\'s pacing is unrelenting as we fallow them through their ideals.Some criticism has come from characters acting irrationally or without emotion and I think that people may be unused to how the characters are portrayed in this show: realistically. Typically, you\'ll have a lead male protagonist who may not be as physically strong as everyone else, but is intelligent, logical, and gets everyone out of trouble while leading them to safety. When a character experiences strong emotions, they will break down and have long monologues about how they feel. In Japan Sinks, characters hide their emotions, knowing that dread and fear are contagions that will endanger the group. This is directly demonstrated in a confrontation between a mother and daughter over how to properly greave. These aren\'t anime heros who think rationally all the time and say the right things, using the right words, they\'re humans who make mistakes left and right, but are always trying to learn and do better.The art is where I think the fairest criticisms lie. Yuasa and Science Saru\'s superflat style has always been just off enough to seem artistic and experimental, but Japan Sinks really wants a down-to-earth style that drives its realism.  It\'s still generally consistent enough to be visually pleasing and provide depth and volume to the characters, but not to the same standards which other, even B-tier, anime typically achieve.Overall, I think Japan Sinks is a great work of art, but definitely not something whose value is derived from the pure enjoyment of consuming it. The pacing is relentless and sad, often in direct opposition to traditional story telling devices. Dreary sections will drag on long after your brain started screaming for them to end and intense sections are so packed together that you and the characters will have little time to gleam their deeper meanings except in retrospect. It challenges the viewer; never guiding them towards a philosophical idea or explaining each characters motivations in depth, it wants you to think for yourself. It really should likely not be binged.For those who do not see much beyond the surface, this show will appear random, chaotic, sad, and unnecessary. It\'s hard to say who will come out with that impression because it may have little to do with their literary analysis skills and I don\'t want it to sound like I\'m saying ""if you thought this, you\'re bad at literature"" because I don\'t believe that. Our subjective perspective will impact the ways in which we interpret media and there are shows that I know are good and deep, but that I find very little intellectual content. What I would like to propose to readers, in closing, is that just because you can\'t see it doesn\'t mean it\'s not there. too large to fit in a post like this and different literature critique philosophies emphasize politics at different levels.

What I would like to propose to readers, in closing, is that just because you can\'t see it doesn\'t mean it\'s not there.', ""Lmao people really out here writing essays on why this show is bad.Story 10/10 - It's not perfect but it kept me intrigued enough to binge through the show.Art 2/10 - The artstyle leans on realism over the pretty anime shi, harsh on the eyes and the animation is dreadful.Sound 6/10 - Some songs really helped with the emotion more than the visuals here did.Character 8/10 - I liked em and got attached, just the right amount of bravery and faults....Enjoyment 10/10 - It brought out a variety of emotions that most anime don't.Overall 9/10 - Give it a watch if you can relate to the themes presented, you've got nothing better to do anyways.

The show\'s tone fluctuates massively and often even every episode. The beginning is built up to be a struggle-filled journey for survival. This is further compounded with very events that show the characters suffering emotionally. However, this grim tone is heavily undermined by all the poorly executed humor and lucky coincidences that get the characters out of bad situations. After weeks into the disaster, the group is suffering and some new characters are added and they work together to survive. Unforgettably the entire setting is hilariously neglected...when the group of characters finds LITERALLY PARADISE. It is at this point where the entire setting of ""Japan Sinking"" is put on the back foot while creepy non-sensical fantasy elements are introduced and the characters are dancing around. Overall, the story is filled with loose ends, bizarre transitions, absurd coincidences, and more appalling details.The art is practically the same as Devilman Crybaby. If you could tolerate that art-style, you can watch this. For those who have not watched Devilman Crybaby, know that the animation is very rough but still captures emotions well.Sound is similarly reminiscent of Devilman Crybaby. For those who have not watched Devilman Crybaby, the soundtrack really sounds like experimentation.The main character, Ayumu, is emotionally damaged by the tragic events around her and suffers from an injury. However, while her emotional state is well resolved her injury has almost no mention throughout the series. That being said, Ayumu is the most interesting character in this show due to her receiving the most screen time and showing distinct change in character as the story progresses (also she makes stupid decisions and learns from them). Most of the other characters aren\'t shown enough to be interesting characters (Koga/KITE) or just don\'t seem to really be fazed by the disaster (Go).I expected a gritty fighting to the tooth and nail survival story from the synopsis but only around half of the show could be feasibly be considered a survival story. My biggest gripe was that the characters\' situation fluctuated from dreadful to optimistic far too much.Did I come into the show with pre-concieved notions? Absolutely, and I think this greatly affected how much I enjoyed the show.If you come in watching this show with the mindset of a slightly cheesy adventure story, then you can enjoy it much more than I did. when the group of characters finds LITERALLY PARADISE.

A score as 8 is too high even for me! But it\'s just the way how this short anime made me feel through the entire anime.(I guess it is in the way your eyes sees the anime or the way the mind wants to see it, that makes one either like it or detest it)[spoiler]People called those sudden death as a ""shock impact"" and ""completely pointless"", but does a death really has to bring/have a point? That was the first...thought that passed through my mind. In the beginning I was also haunting for a reason, like why did the father die? what does this lead to? what is the point with this?! But in the end when I saw how the daughter reacted I realized that the answer was NO. Real life isn\'t like that, people do die suddenly, that\'s how life work, it\'s full of spontaneously. A death doesn\'t even have to have a point or bring out anything good from someone. It isn\'t like that irl either, irl it only brings loneliness and sadness. And the way she handled his death was something that probably everyone found pathetic, like me, but I also found it really pure and realistic. Because a death often doesn\'t make you stronger and willingly, it makes one weaker. In the way you must pretend you are strong but you are actually hurting yourself by doing that. Some could just cry it out, become unmotivated but that\'s also tough. The daughters reaction portrayed a teenager trying to process her fathers sudden death, (that is what I could see and feel at least) by trying to understand why this happened. But in the end because she couldn\'t find or see any point of the death she snapped and tried to find a guilty one. That is what I believe at least based from the feelings I got from those scenes.  And the same goes for the other\'s death. We will never know when someone will die, and why on that specific time or moment because that is life. It\'s unknown. And a death doesn\'t always have a reason/bring a point in others life.I don\'t even know how, but they did make me feel attached to most of them, and only in 10 episodes! I did cherish for them and in such a short time too.But the most wonderful part (in my opinion) is the end, because the daughter realizes that just because a lot of close people died, it doesn\'t mean that her life ends t0o. And so is it in irl  too. Even though peoples death makes one sad and lonely, life doesn\'t end there.  This is a sadly a part of our life and if we can\'t accept it then we won\'t survive in this meaningless world (bc it\'s so when u think about, we only live to work in our whole life). That is why her mother always told her to do what makes her most happy. Because in the end it is only that, that will matter in the end. All those happy memories you have created with your family, friends and in the work are the things that you will always cherish. And that is something I believe we need to have in our life, to being able to continue living, bc in the end the death is something we will always encounter in our lifespan. AND YOU WHERE TELLING ME THERE WAS NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Well what the daughter went through was a character development if you ask me, because in the end she realized what life is and what really matters. This is something we will all experience once in our life, coming over the hard ships life brings on.All those weird, sad and strangely happy emotions I felt (when i laughed to the non ""attentionate"" funny scens) made me able to reflect and think about all that I wrote above. In just 10 episodes, and I think that is why I gave it such a high score. In the end idk if it was the storyline or the emotions that awakened in in me, that made me like it. I guess both parts are very crucial and have a connection to each other. But if I didn\'t feel any of that I felt I would have given the storyline 6/10 points. I do tho believe that the story line has a part of it being able to feel those emotions and reflect on life.I don\'t even know if the storyline was intended to wake up those feelings. If it is so, great then, but if it isn\'t like that then it sucks and I was lucky:)Ps: I do agree the animation art went from badder to badder but in the end it\'s the emotions that wakens within me that matters for me. thought that passed through my mind.

Well things didn\'t go exactly as I expected from the 10 episode ONA. It had some ups and downs but I somehow managed to binge it in two goes.Story 5/10The story is pretty simple that Japan is sinking and we follow a certain family on how they survive this ordeal. The start was a strong one with the animation of the first episode and it got through...to the audience with the devastation of a catastrophic event. From that point on, it was incoherent following weird set-ups which led the cast nowhere. They tried too cram in too much and eventually making most the events irrelevant. It had a simple start and we just somehow made it to the ending which actually was pretty decent.Art & Animation 7/10The background animation was really good throughout the series. The backgrounds were able to truly capture the disasters caused by the earthquake. Other than that it was classic Yuasa style but there were many occasion when the animation lacked. The character designs, well I was expecting more since they were pretty generic.Sound 6/10For the most part they picked the right music but occasionally the choice of the music was really terrible. Like in one scene a character dies with a weird somber music playing and with the next scene, a cheerful music is playing. Other than that, the music during the suspense scenes was good. The opening was really good and was soothing to listen to.Characters 3/10The weakest part of the story were the characters. That\'s how it went in certain cases, ""Hey look, a new character. Oooh wait, he fucking dies in two episodes in a meaningless way."" The main girl was mediocre for most the time, doing annoying stuff in a few episodes and sometimes doing reasonable stuff.The regret for the characters was a good part but it was nerfed due to the fact that they were all cheery the next scene after a death due to cramming too much stuff into those 10 episodes. There were some decent characters here and there. If a few characters were to be kept alive, the story could have been better. In the end, not a big fan of the characters.Enjoyment 6/10I enjoyed the start and ending of the show with one or two decent episodes in-between. The background animation was one of the most enjoyable aspects to the show. Somehow still managed to enjoy it more than I expected even with the negatives.Overall it is a 5.5-6/10 for me, I would recommend the Yuasa fans to watch it but don\'t expect anything extraordinary and keep your hopes low.Now, it\'s time to look forward to the next movie project from Science Saru, ""Inu-Oh"" for which the legendary Taiyo Matsumoto is doing the character designs, so I guess we wait and see how that turns out but I am pretty positive that it would be something extraordinary judging from the people that are working on it and the premise of the show. to the audience with the devastation of a catastrophic event.

The animation reminded me of The Girl Who Leapt through Time. Naturally, I expected it to be full of emotional moments between close characters who are desperately trying to survive through an apocalypse. And, instead, what I got was random passing characters who appear out of nowhere and die just as quickly.The first episode was great. It set the mood for what was about to come, and the intensity from the first few moments until the end of...the episode didn't drop. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there. Since the story was going to center around the family, I had expected it to focus on their relationships and how the apocalypse was going to test them. Instead, unnecessary characters were mixed in and I could feel their desperate attempt to make us like each one of them. Especially that fucking cult arc, man, what the fuck was that??? Also, Ayumu had time to work at an infirmary AND party during her stay in the cult, but didn't think to treat her big ass wound???? She worked at an INFIRMARY for fuck's sake!!The last episode would actually have been a good ending if Episodes 2-9 went towards a decent direction. Needless to say, I didn't feel any sort of attachment towards the characters (maybe except Kite because he carried the whole group to survival). I didn't even feel a thing when Ayumu was crying on her hospital bed. Not even during the montage of all their happy moments. Nothing. The character designs were decent, don't get me wrong, but they lacked so much buildup that I didn't feel any sense of connection or importance from them at all. In fact, the characters themselves were so indifferent whenever someone in their group died that I eventually got desensitized to all the deaths as well. Like, oh, her mom died? That's sad, I guess.Honestly the only things that stood out to me in this show were the soundtrack and the fire rap battle. Those were the only things that made it enjoyable.[TL;DR]Me: Oh shit an apocalypse show about Japan centered around a family!!

Spooky ghosts, outdoor tools of any kind-wielding maniacs, or murderous tires on a rampage all have done a proper job of scaring me silly.When I think of what horrifies me however.  What stays with me for hours, days, weeks, after viewing, is when I can visualize the reality of a fictional piece.  Tsunami\'s, Volcanoes, Asteroids, and Black Holes are all real things (Yes anyone can be an garden equipment psycho...but c\'mon).  Real things that, even with technological advancements, may happen at any fucking moment.  You could one second be shopping for a new fuzzy sweater for your rat-sized shit you call a dog.The next, poof.  Gone.  The end.  Swallowed by a plane of space-time.Rough.Equally as terrifying is the humanistic element.  When tragedies occur, the worst of humanism is unearthed.  Evidenced by the pandemic, you see those immediately rising to fight for that last roll of toilet paper in King-Of-The-Hill style combat.  It is apart of our beings to defend for ourselves and our loved ones.  To do whatever to survive.  Even if that means stepping on those below you.  While our morality may clash against that notion, in the prospect that your country was on the verge of a cataclysm and sinking into the ocean floor, what would you do?This is what initially incepted my interest in Japan Sinks 2020, the new anime licensed by Netflix, based on the legendary novel (that I will totally not bullshit you by saying I have read) by Sakyo Komatsu.  A novel that took nearly a decade to complete, winning a multitude of awards, and sparking various adaptions over the years through different mediums.In this adaption, an earthquake of country destroying proportions, well, destroys the country.  This triggers event after event of natural disasters that would make the movie 2012 about, well, 2012, jealous.  We follow the Mutō family and those they meet on their journey as they desperately attempt to survive a country that is literally falling apart.In my preview of Summer 2020 anime (which one can view here), I mentioned this was one of, if not my most anticipated show of the season.  For the very same reasons aforementioned about horror, I thought this should resonate to my core and elaborate on philosophical concepts of survival and ethics.  In a season marred by delays and ecchi, this would be the bright spot.Well I was wrong.Where do I begin?  This was an atrocity.  When Netflix had stated they were simulcasting this, my thoughts jumped initially to the company testing out changes to their distribution platforms.  If this series went well, more and more shows had the potential to escape from Netflix Jail/Prison/Hell.  While I was watching this however, I remembered another anime that was simulcast just last year by Netflix, 7 Seeds.  Coincidentally, that anime also blew balls.Screw a coincidence, it\'s conspiracy time.  As with 7 Seeds, they could see this project wasn\'t going anywhere, so they rushed the hoohah out of it, throwing it out there as soon as possible to limit the money drain.  They don\'t give a rat\'s prostate about the viewership experience, they just wanted to save a few bucks.Back on track.With regard to the actual show, I want to start with the aesthetics.  Typically, I choose not prattle on about art.  It is indeed subjective, and Science Saru, the studio in charge, is infamous for their unique animation.  Ping Pong, Devilman Crybaby, and Eizouken all look weird as shit.  However, in each, the style compliments their conceptualizations, granting the creators greater freedoms to illustrate their ideas (Eizouken being the best example of this).  Here, everything just looks and feels ugly.  The backgrounds are simple, and the characters have very little consistency.  The CGI scenes are insipid and reminiscent of the medium\'s potential in the 1980\'s.  The inability of the studio to have any dynamic movements actually made for a few giggles.  In particular, there\'s one ""kick"" where I had to rewind just to make sure my monitor hadn\'t glitched.  This feels at best rushed and at worst incomplete.  My conspiracy lives on.The music did no favors either.  The OP&ED are forgettable, but where my confusion lies is with the OST.  There were quite a few scenes when the soundtrack would portray the complete opposite emotion of what (I suppose) I was trying to feel.  At multiple points throughout the story, where tragedy strikes, such as a character death, there is this one upbeat, adventurous, almost jovial song in the background that found me tonally dumbfounded.The characters are essentially all plot contrivances, once again similar to 7 Seeds.  However, at least there, the fact that they were survivalists was kind of the point.  Here, you\'ve got the all star team of Japan at your disposal.  Electrician, fix-it-all Dad, Olympic Swimmer Mom, Gamer Kid who knows English and all things internet, and, well, the daughter just runs fast, but not that fast.  Further, I present EDM and Track Star Glasses Guy, and YouTube superstar, paragliding champ, techno wizard, Seto Kaiba-esque rich guy, amongst others.  As we go further into the story, characters magically develop new skills like savants leading to the question: What can\'t these people do?Be likable.With all these incredulous talents, most of the main cast come off as flat, or downright annoying.  I understand the son is trying to learn English, but isn\'t there a time and place?  In the absolute worst of times, he\'ll blurt out an English phrase, continuously leaving me off-put.  How tone deaf could one be?I\'ve done a very poor job of not using superlatives or melodramatic descriptions thus far, but when I say the daughter is quite possibly the worst character I\'ve seen in recent memory, I mean it.  In a world where everyone around her seems like they have the potential to apply for the Avengers, she is useless.  Perhaps she could contribute through acting as a voice of reason, but rather she is the voice of complaints.  Quite questionable complaints, asinine complaints.  Upset because someone shared a candy bar, or because they stole food from what appeared to be an empty ass store, settling for taking ""only the expiring things.""  Woman, now is not the time to be worrying about the ethics of shoplifting.The plot is as messy and broken as the sinking country the show is set in.  Government subterfuge, xenophobes, a cult (seriously what was the point of the cult), and a tooth USB drive, I am not sure what the creators wanted this to be.

Then, episode 3 started with so much levity it gave me whiplash.  Later, a character tragedy that actually made sense tugged at my heart.  What followed?  A rap battle.  And a mute man blinking to the beat.To it\'s credit, moments like these were what got me to finish the show.  By no means during the process was I bored.  Nothing made sense, so around half way through I just gave up and attempted to buckle up and enjoy the broken-ass ride.

Eh, probably just bad.  But you\'ve got to give credit where it\'s due.I would best describe this series as a rough draft.  Many wonderful ideas.  Too many.  Waaayyyyyyy too many.  Unfortunately, per the conspiracy, I believe these ideas were all presented and then Netflix gave them 10 episodes, a couple hundred yen, and a few months to pull it off.  Or the creators did a Michael Bay amount of cocaine.  Either way, the result is a whirlwind of happenings with no substance, with the occasional unintentional chuckle in between. but c\'mon).  Real things that, even with technological advancements, may happen at any fucking moment.  You could one second be shopping for a new fuzzy sweater for your rat-sized shit you call a dog.The next, poof.  Gone.  The end.  Swallowed by a plane of space-time.Rough.Equally as terrifying is the humanistic element.  When tragedies occur, the worst of humanism is unearthed.  Evidenced by the pandemic, you see those immediately rising to fight for that last roll of toilet paper in King-Of-The-Hill style combat.  It is apart of our beings to defend for ourselves and our loved ones.  To do whatever to survive.  Even if that means stepping on those below you.  While our morality may clash against that notion, in the prospect that your country was on the verge of a cataclysm and sinking into the ocean floor, what would you do?This is what initially incepted my interest in Japan Sinks 2020, the new anime licensed by Netflix, based on the legendary novel (that I will totally not bullshit you by saying I have read) by Sakyo Komatsu.  A novel that took nearly a decade to complete, winning a multitude of awards, and sparking various adaptions over the years through different mediums.In this adaption, an earthquake of country destroying proportions, well, destroys the country.  This triggers event after event of natural disasters that would make the movie 2012 about, well, 2012, jealous.  We follow the Mutō family and those they meet on their journey as they desperately attempt to survive a country that is literally falling apart.In my preview of Summer 2020 anime (which one can view here), I mentioned this was one of, if not my most anticipated show of the season.  For the very same reasons aforementioned about horror, I thought this should resonate to my core and elaborate on philosophical concepts of survival and ethics.  In a season marred by delays and ecchi, this would be the bright spot.Well I was wrong.Where do I begin?  This was an atrocity.  When Netflix had stated they were simulcasting this, my thoughts jumped initially to the company testing out changes to their distribution platforms.  If this series went well, more and more shows had the potential to escape from Netflix Jail/Prison/Hell.  While I was watching this however, I remembered another anime that was simulcast just last year by Netflix, 7 Seeds.  Coincidentally, that anime also blew balls.Screw a coincidence, it\'s conspiracy time.  As with 7 Seeds, they could see this project wasn\'t going anywhere, so they rushed the hoohah out of it, throwing it out there as soon as possible to limit the money drain.  They don\'t give a rat\'s prostate about the viewership experience, they just wanted to save a few bucks.Back on track.With regard to the actual show, I want to start with the aesthetics.  Typically, I choose not prattle on about art.  It is indeed subjective, and Science Saru, the studio in charge, is infamous for their unique animation.  Ping Pong, Devilman Crybaby, and Eizouken all look weird as shit.  However, in each, the style compliments their conceptualizations, granting the creators greater freedoms to illustrate their ideas (Eizouken being the best example of this).  Here, everything just looks and feels ugly.  The backgrounds are simple, and the characters have very little consistency.  The CGI scenes are insipid and reminiscent of the medium\'s potential in the 1980\'s.  The inability of the studio to have any dynamic movements actually made for a few giggles.  In particular, there\'s one ""kick"" where I had to rewind just to make sure my monitor hadn\'t glitched.  This feels at best rushed and at worst incomplete.  My conspiracy lives on.The music did no favors either.  The OP&ED are forgettable, but where my confusion lies is with the OST.  There were quite a few scenes when the soundtrack would portray the complete opposite emotion of what (I suppose) I was trying to feel.  At multiple points throughout the story, where tragedy strikes, such as a character death, there is this one upbeat, adventurous, almost jovial song in the background that found me tonally dumbfounded.The characters are essentially all plot contrivances, once again similar to 7 Seeds.  However, at least there, the fact that they were survivalists was kind of the point.  Here, you\'ve got the all star team of Japan at your disposal.  Electrician, fix-it-all Dad, Olympic Swimmer Mom, Gamer Kid who knows English and all things internet, and, well, the daughter just runs fast, but not that fast.  Further, I present EDM and Track Star Glasses Guy, and YouTube superstar, paragliding champ, techno wizard, Seto Kaiba-esque rich guy, amongst others.  As we go further into the story, characters magically develop new skills like savants leading to the question: What can\'t these people do?Be likable.With all these incredulous talents, most of the main cast come off as flat, or downright annoying.  I understand the son is trying to learn English, but isn\'t there a time and place?  In the absolute worst of times, he\'ll blurt out an English phrase, continuously leaving me off-put.  How tone deaf could one be?I\'ve done a very poor job of not using superlatives or melodramatic descriptions thus far, but when I say the daughter is quite possibly the worst character I\'ve seen in recent memory, I mean it.  In a world where everyone around her seems like they have the potential to apply for the Avengers, she is useless.  Perhaps she could contribute through acting as a voice of reason, but rather she is the voice of complaints.  Quite questionable complaints, asinine complaints.

Maybe some of you dislike the art and decided not to watch, well i really recomending this anime.Overall the story is SUPER GOOD. I really like the characters development, twists and turns this anime gave me. It's not just some cliche anime that all safe all well. The feeling when someone died or gone missing is real. Some of you maybe think that this anime is so fast-paced. But that's normal in the middle of earthquakes that's happening all over-they don't know when or where it'll be.My fav characters here is Kite and Haruo. The characters...development on them is really really amazing. I want to write it down but i don't want to give spoilers to anyone who want to watch this. Speaking about character development, Ayumu 's character development is really amazing too. But because she's the main character, i'm not surprised.Well my review ends here. Go watch the anime and rate it for yourself! It's just 10 eps. No biggie :D development on them is really really amazing.

No biggie :D"", ""Japan Strikes is a spectacular failure on every level. The story is convoluted at best and incompetent at worst, the animation is ugly as sin, the music is so off tone it's astonishing, and the characters somehow manage to be the world's first 1-dimensional beings. That being said, all of these awful elements being stitched together into one dumpster fire of an ONA has made for a work of pure genius, and I enjoyed it far more than I'd be willing to admit in public.Beyond the initial disaster and the ongoing sinking of the Japanese Islands, Japan Sinks doesn't have much of a story to...speak of. It begins as a sort of survival story (which it does keep elements of throughout), but it becomes clear as the episodes go on that it's intended as more of a character study (unfortunately, given the state of the characters). That being said, it is the single most bizarre character study I have ever seen. At every turn, the show throws the characters into the most ridiculous situations imaginable - picture Final Destination but as a character study - and the entire plot hinges on everyone acting in the most nonsensical way possible. At one point, an honest-to-god Youtuber drops out of the sky to rescue the main cast from poison gas, only to take them to a shop where they are immediately shot at by an old man with a bow and arrow, who joins them on a trip to the base of a marijuana cult headed by a woman who speaks to the dead. It's a journey, to say the least.The art, as mentioned, is ugly as sin. I cannot explain to you the visceral discomfort I get looking at this show in action. The character designs are average at best, but proportions change near constantly and the line work takes them into the uncanny valley territory of things more often than not.The sound is... god. Picture some of the worst disaster imagery you have ever seen - I'm talking not a single house standing, streets in pieces, everything on fire - right, now imagine the kind of music that might be played at a middle school dance. Smash those two together, and you get whatever the living fuck this is. The contrast is incredible. They manage to play exactly the wrong music in almost every situation. It's an art unto itself, really.Every character in Japan Sinks behaves like an alien dropped onto earth for the very first time. Listening to them speak to each other is an experience almost akin to having a stroke. I could not name a single personality trait of any of the main four. The most interesting of the bunch is an obnoxious little boy who won't stop saying random english phrases, and the only feeling I can muster toward him (or any of them, for that matter) is contempt. All other characters are level-5 sociopaths. Like, they all suck. I don't know why, but this appears to be a universe made up of only the worst humanity has to offer, and it's honestly uncomfortable to watch the human husks presented to us as main characters navigate the most hostile environment possible with everyone around them actively seeking to make their lives worse.All of this - all of these terrible, horrible elements - come together to form a fantastically confusing dumpster fire that is genuinely entertaining. If you made it through the first episode and maybe got a chuckle out of it, it might be worth your while. If you're going to take it at all seriously, don't watch it.I'm torn between declaring it an ironic masterpiece and calling it worthless trash, and that's all you really need to know about Japan Sinks: 2020. speak of.

While it is animated by Saru Science, don\'t automatically assume that Yuasa is at the helm, but instead Pyeon-Gang Ho, making her series director debut. Lower your expectations if you are someone like me who even enjoys the most ""divisive"" Yuasa show (I will fight to the death defending Devilman Crybaby as a ""remix"" rather than a traditional adaption), because this Japan Sinks 2020 is not only a very different show than what you would expect from Science Saru, but it\'s also a show that has...many, many, MANY more issues than any other full length show since the studio was founded.You can tell that this show got screwed over by COVID right off the bat, with the show taking place after the 2020 Olympics. If you weren\'t paying attention to that tidbit, then you will get countless opportunities to see how coronavirus did more than just make the show dated barely five minutes in. The character designs and animation show classic signs of a troubled production schedule, where characters will look like they aged by 10+ years in many cuts (plus a shot of a child looking like a fat 40 year-old woman that was scaled down), especially in the second half, where several action sequences look choppy and incomplete. Again, since this is not Yuasa, there are no rare sparks of visual flare to be found. Forget out the drop-dead gorgeous coloring from Tatami Galaxy or Night is Short. Forget about Kaiba and Mind Game\'s wild-but-minimalist art, or even some of the more twisted, macabre scenes from Devilman Crybaby or Kemonozume, or even balls-to-the-wall sakuga like the water pillar in the Space Dandy episode Slow and Steady Wins the Race, Baby, or any of the cool scenes that Eizouken tirelessly cranks out.The premise is fine, but Japan Sinks relies on cheap tricks that thud against the wall. Attempts to garner sympathy for the characters are merely attempts, and not very good ones at that. It\'s hard to feel anything when most of the cast are killed off so casually that I\'m almost thankful that the audience isn\'t subjected to a hundred and one scenes of sobbing and mourning, because it would probably end up at least five episodes longer otherwise, even if it does feel cruel to brush off death of family, friends, or neighbors. Japan Sinks also has trouble keeping its themes in-line. A character exists almost solely to push a ""xenophobia bad"" message, but in the end, this same character is championed as a hero. There\'s a ham-fisted criticism of nationalism, but then there\'s a scene that lasts for almost three times longer than the stab at nationalists that glorifies Japan and its culture that is SUPPOSED to come across as patriotic, but it drags on for so long that it comes off as egotistical. There\'s even a cameo by everyone\'s favorite buzzword: Fake News™, in case your eyes haven\'t been rolling hard enough to make laps around your eyes yet. And then there\'s some real head-ass moments. The writing staff are extremely ignorant on drugs and incorporates some supernatural malarkey, even though the show leans on scientific phenomenon as a driving catalyst for everything that happens in the series.I know that this has come under fire for being seen as a piece of critique on Japanese people, but I refrained from talking about it too much outside of this paragraph. Since I am not a native Japanese, I am not in the best position to address themes that are being labeled as ""anti-Japanese"", but I will say that it\'s not 100% ""anti-Japan"" since they do kinda puff out their chests in the epilogue by painting their culture (not the citizens) in a positive light. Now for the bad news: this show has another case of lazy LGBT ""representation"", where the demographic is treated as a checkmark in a box instead of actually being implemented into a character\'s personality or personal growth. I thought we were done with the J.K. Rowling Method of dropping ""btw X is gay/trans/etc."" out of the sky. The series is practically over by the time of the reveal, and it contributes to ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, nor is it foreshadowed or even hinted at up to that point.That\'s not to say that it doesn\'t have some good points. While the first three episodes are indeed complete and utter garbage, it does get better, or at the very least, more entertaining. It does some good job at foreshadowing, even if they do need to have a bit more faith in the audience to ""show"" instead of ""tell"", and several scenes in the second half have genuine tension to them, even if the tension results from subverting expectations brought along by conditioning the viewer for the first two-thirds of the series. Japan Sinks is at its strongest when it gets the rare opportunity to work on world-building, which is just as odd as it sounds considering that the core characters are the primary focus with everything else playing second fiddle. This is a bit of a problem because the cast has a bad case of mood whiplash, especially in those first three episodes that I heavily chastised at the start of this paragraph.Overall, Japan Sinks 2020 was... kinda alright, despite me ragging on it nonstop.

All of the characters were gems in their own right and left a lasting impact on the show. Every character meant something and even though this is definitely full of tragedy, I still found it heartwarming.Loved the characters, liked that weird fluidity of animation that seems to be a staple for Masaaki Yuasa, loved the music, and even though the story was outstanding and bizarre at times it was still great! Basically I really enjoyed it.Be warned that it does get graphic. Be sure you're in the right state of...mind before you jump in. mind before you jump in."", 'Why did this even get made?It had one good episode, and after that it was if the studio writers were egging each other on to write a worse episode than the last. What was extremely disappointing to me was that it appeared as though they were developing the characters, until the end of episode one, where this development was frozen, thrown out of a window and smashed to pieces with a baseball bat.The main characters were replaced each by a single adjective in place of a personality. I wish I could have my time back, plus 200% compensation. What the fuck was this? ', 'Overall rating:7.6/10Another enjoyable series by Masaaki Yuasa which delves into the impact of catastrophy on humans just like his previous works, ""Devilman Crybaby"" or ""Mind Game"". The similarity in these 2 series is very striking and evident, be it the style of animation, the series being inspired by an anime or a novel of a similar name, using fantastical imagery to portray human psychology and behaviour when faced with ""kill or be killed"" situations or the flawless inclusion of dark and creepy elements that Yuasa is known for.*Trivial spoilers*Striking Features:  Inspired from a 1973 novel of the same name, Yuasa has given this anime...a revolutionary touch and attempted to show the changes that have come in terms of technology and culture in Japan since then.For example: The original novel was centered around scientists and politicians trying to save japan, but the anime focuses on the Mutoh family and their attempts to save themselves by reaching higher ground as japan submerges.Talking about the shift in culture, Yuasa includes foreign characters(mother Mari and Kite) to portray the diversity in Japan now. Moreover,  Go Mutoh dreams of going to Estonia and communicates with his friends online in English. By making Mari the caretaker of the family as they move forward, this anime challenges traditional gender roles too. The rap in the 9th episode effectively taught the viewers that it\'s not the place/country that matters, it\'s the people who make our life enjoyable and memorable.Story: 7.4/10The story starts of with the Mutoh family. Mari on a plane back to japan, Ayumu at her track practice, Koichiro working at a construction site, and Go playing video games at home, when an earthquake strikes. Since Japan is prone to earthquakes, it\'s not a big deal but no one knows that their lives are about to be disrupted by multiple high frequency earthquake, followed by landslides, tsunami, and Mt. Fuji erupting(all of these are reasonable in japan though, just the intensity is aggravated in the story) which leads to Japan sinking. The story progresses with the Mutoh family and a few friends taking a different path from the rest in search of higher land, keeping their lives on the line.Animation:7.8/10This show is heavily complimeted by the stellar animation and cinematography and kudos to Toshikazu Kuno for that. The animation is mostly similar to ""devilman crybaby"" as is expected for a production company to have a trademark style. It\'s pretty good, detailed. It\'s known that Yuasa is plucky enough to show characters meeting sudden, twisted and gruesome ends and this anime is no different. So, the unfazed and bold death scenes deserve an ovation as some of them will definitely twist your insides with shock and disbelief, as if your heart\'s gonna burst XD.Background music:7.6/10The sound/background music is particularly soothing which I found strange in the beginning but it just adds to the creepiness and uncertainty of when and how someone\'s gonna die.Character:5Character development was not satisfactory for some characters in my point of view.Kite, no. 1 youtuber suddenly stops and throws his life on the line for an unknown family he just met which is unreasonable. Mari\'s profession and where was she returning wasn\'t described well. Go suddenly puts in unnecessary english sentences in conversations which sound cringy.Personal complaints: 1) There is a major death in every episode and that makes us habituated, it becomes another feature of the corner. The death and loss becomes repititive towards the end and they fail to make an impact.2) Although the animation is good, but there is hardly any camera angle or sequence out of the ordinary or having a deeper meaning. It\'s plain abd simple.3) Midway through the series, it becomes more or less guessable which characters will survive, so the only uncertain thing is the order and manner of the deaths.4) Foreign characters speaking such horrible English is a major setback here. If it had been Japanese characters who spoke in that accent, it\'d have been okay but Kite speaking like that is a failure in my point of view.5) The most obvious point, the striking similarity with Devilman crybaby. Except the basic premise, they\'ve major similarities which i guess everyone who\'ve watched both these series will agree. It provides nothing new in the field of animation(the animation\'s not bad though as i said earlier) and forces us to compare these 2 series at every point.All in all, the series is enjoyable(not a must watch) for thrill and sci-fi lovers. a revolutionary touch and attempted to show the changes that have come in terms of technology and culture in Japan since then.For example: The original novel was centered around scientists and politicians trying to save japan, but the anime focuses on the Mutoh family and their attempts to save themselves by reaching higher ground as japan submerges.Talking about the shift in culture, Yuasa includes foreign characters(mother Mari and Kite) to portray the diversity in Japan now.

I felt like this anime could be the next big one. The premise was so promising but the execution was just literally bad.The first few episodes had me glued but then the story goes down the drain. The character development is absolutely ""Zero"". The animations are also not upto the mark. I wouldn\'t say that it\'s disastrously bad, but it just doesn\'t feel right.We just cannot connect to the characters at all. It felt like the writers desparately killed off some characters in an attempt to give the series a post apocalyptic...feel which it promises but it miserably fails at doing so and it just feels so predictable and some of them felt unnecessary.It is a one time watch! I would recommend the first 3 episodes but after that it\'s just a train wreck. feel which it promises but it miserably fails at doing so and it just feels so predictable and some of them felt unnecessary.It is a one time watch! I would recommend the first 3 episodes but after that it\'s just a train wreck.', 'This review contains spoilersThe only reason I even bothered to check out Japan Sinks is that I saw the name ""Masaki Yuasa"" in the crew. I really liked Devilman crybaby and from that point on I actually had some faith in Netflix that it can do better than the Death Note live action film. I hadn\'t seen that film but i clearly know how they butchered the plot in it. Coming to Masaki Yuasa.... just that guy\'s name makes me more curious than the cat that unfortunately doesn\'t live among us. Yuasa was the chief director instead of the episodic director of the show...which i honestly don\'t know the difference between.........so seeing a Korean guy I barely even know on the director\'s chair wasn\'t a deal breaker.Coming to the show..... I always wondered why the medium of anime had such a low number of shows in the disaster subgenre. The only one besides this that managed to gain mainstream popularity was Tokyo Magnitude 8 which I had seen a few months earlier just because it was an exclusive disaster anime at that time. I really liked it. It had great characters.... Super fast pacing and great music.... So I was expecting the same stuff to come across me in Japan Sinks.But the thing is...... Early reviews of the anime were quite polarised and I can see why. Japan sinks has as many problems as merits. The story is.......Good..... And yes my pause does imply that I have more to say. Japan gets hit by an earthquake and...... That\'s it..... The thing is.... It\'s impossible for an anime of this genre to be any more than it\'s face value.... What was advertised to us is what we got. An anime where an earthquake hits japan and everybody is struggling to survive. The situation is too dire to add anything new... I don\'t mean to say that this anime didn\'t try but it sadly failed to pull it off...... First of all.... We are introduced to the main character of the show.... Ayumu who is apparently very good at athletics and is preparing for the Olympics. As soon as I registered that detail..... I wondered where had I seen that before..... And then it hit me... Miki from Devilman....... Please Yuasa san.... There are other ways to start a show.The one thing that I noticed in the very first episode is that the creators are paranoid that the audience won\'t feel as much emotion as they expect..... So they cram some deep moments even when it\'s not necessary.... Ayumu was depressed that she couldn\'t save her team mates from being crushed during the quake... But she shouldn\'t be depressed over that..... She had no power in the situation whatsoever. And the last thing I want to see is people who let their emotions take over their rationale during an earthquake. We skip to the next part where people everywhere are panicking like crazy. That really alarmed me.......Panicking should be the last thing they do. The story is set in Japan....... An area which is severely prone to earthquakes. I don\'t live there but I know that disaster drills are as integral part of the people\'s lives as their other responsibilities. I really thought that the anime would be about brave people standing up to the disaster and doing the best to keep themselves and their country alive...... Just like the HBO series Chernobyl..... But here.... The characters create more problems for themselves than the disaster ever could. Plus.... The sense of patriotism they showed (which i expected cause.... Japan..duh) was more toxic than inspiring. I will get to this point later.It always felt that the characters\' iq was as low as their survival chances. The dad gers killed in episode 2 because he apparently hit a bomb with a shovel while digging for some food. I really did a facepalm at this moment because WHO DOESN\'T KNOW about the bombs hidden within japanese soil....... I mean there were even several signboards warning them which apparently EVERYBODY saw except the man who was digging. It always felt like the director wanted him to die by any means possible. Even if there was no signboard..... Most of the Japanese DO KNOW about the bombs..... A similar mistake was committed by the main character of the movie ""in this corner of the world"" by studio MAPPA. Everyone knew about the bomb except the main character because she was destined to lose a leg or two. All I want to say is that...... If the father was as wise as he was shown..... Then where did those intuitions go before he started digging.Unfortunately... The father wasn\'t the only one who turned off his brain during the show. In episode 7.... The authorities asked Ayumu to board a ship bound away from Japan because unsurprisingly Japan prioritised the younger population over the old dudes who won\'t help rebuild the nation. But our great heroine abandoned the ship because she didn\'t want to leave the family alone.... Gone are the days when I used to applaud such bravery..... Now it\'s just stupid.... Even if Ayumu left the group... It\'s not like their chances of survival are going to dwindle. She cannot do much to save them. In fact.... She didn\'t do anything throughout the show that only she could have done. Her athletic abilities don\'t ever come in handy too. The scene would have made much more sense if Mari was the one who abandoned the ship for her family. Because in this case... The family actually wouldn\'t survive if the kids were left alone. By not going away.... Ayumu just added on to the burden Mari had.The story also featured a meaningless arc where the party took shelter with a cult. Never had i thought a day would come that an anime would try to rip off a show from my country....... Yup this cult felt way similar to the cult featured in another Netflix show Sacred Games. There were obvious similarities which were hard to Ignore. A person everyone worshipped..... The person using his right hand guy/girl as a sex partner and the cult always talking about an impending doom. I won\'t bore the readers of my review with a detailed comparison of an anime and a non anime show so i just pointed out some signposts in brief.Moving on.... There are some other characters as well. An ultra edgy YouTuber who lives in Estonia but came to Japan just at the wrong time because reasons. Not to mention that his character design is way too similar to Ryo from devilman. A guy that wears glasses and there is nothing else to state about him cause that\'s how much the show cared either. The glasses guy flew under the radar throughout the entire show until episode 9 when he got the limelight. And by this point.... The show made it clear that no one is going to survive except the siblings. He made a run to recover the disk drive Kite wanted but was drowned to death by a wave before he could return... How that would have been very tragic under normal circumstances but it came out as stupid considering that he paused for a dramatic 3 2 1 before running. If he would have been practical instead....... I am sure he would have got the extra second needed to survive.There are some plot points that just happen by itself........ Such as Kite finding a frigate to drive out of nowhere..... And an underwater batcave like thing with a fully functional computer available to him just at the right time with proper electrical supply which is itself rare enough at a time like this. The characters often find vehicles in perfectly working conditions which also have adequate fuel.. Both in land and water... The real question is..... If they work properly... Why would anyone abandon those..... Especially at a time when they are needed most. Being just 10 episodes long..... There is hardly enough time to get attached to any character.... Tokyo magnitude fixed this problem by compressing the amount of people involved. Consequently... When characters die..... I always react like this ""oh no they died......let\'s click on next episode"". Also the detail about Mari suffering from some fatal disease came just before her death so the audience doesn\'t get the time to even look at her in that sympathetic way.The anime got lots of flak from the community for portraying japanese as very selfish people which is objectively very false. In a country where you can leave your laptop at a restaurant and be sure that no one will steal it....... It\'s hard to believe that it\'s citizens would behave in such a way. I truly felt that the racism they showed in episode 7 was made up and that real Japanese wouldn\'t distinguish them from any other victim during rescue efforts..... Also the Shopkeeper attaching the group because they wanted some food from his shop was another example of the people being selfish towards the needy.......the director should have been more careful when portraying a demographic as a whole using such characters.The ending was my most favourite part of the show featuring the rebuilding of Japan. I admit it was kinda rushed but such a long process would feel like that no matter how much of the 10 episode runtime you take to Cover it. The thing that prevented the ending form being excellent was the fact that the lives of the siblings as refugees was way too comfortable to be believable. They get a nice apartment with all facilities and electronics. I always wondered which government was kind enough to give them better living standards that their parents could ever afford. Ayumu losing her leg was a genuinely sad moment but her recovering from the loss and participating in the paralympics made it brilliant. Also her speech at the end was genuinely inspiring at it kinda made me momentarily forget about the faults of the show.The animation of the show was...... Alright.. I really dislike the fact that the 2D animation of Science Saru looks really 2D....they always cut corners on the shadows and light effects which other studios do brilliantly. Also the character designs are too simple to be remembered for long periods of time. The soundtrack of the show is just legendary. The op is kinda meh but the OST makes up for it. If you are still reading the review.... I beg you to search ""attack of legends japan sinks"" on youtube and listen to that masterpiece.Overall.... The anime has an equal balance of wrongs and rights. I am a bit soft while reviewing disaster anime due to the fact that how rare they are. But this show is despite all problems..... A good one time watch and considering the fact that it\'s so short...... It would be unfair if i don\'t ask anyone to alteast check it out.....

Adieu', '// SPOILER WARNING //I want to start this review by saying that i\'ve never experienced an earthquake so far in my life, so I can\'t really relate to the situation that the characters are put in. Yes, earthquakes this large rarely happen, but people who have been through one or two earthquakes or more can and will relate to this more than I have.Japan Sinks 2020 is a show that I discovered when it was announced, i\'m pretty sure it was on twitter. When I saw the title, I decided to give it a shot when it came out, because it sounded completely different to...anything i\'d seen so far. Come the release date, I had forgotten about it, and remembered it had released when I was scrolling through Netflix and remembered it was supposed to come out soon, and it had already released, so I started watching.// Story : 7/10The overall idea behind Japan Sinks isn\'t a bad one, i\'d say it\'s actually decently original when it comes to plot in anime. It loses points for some of it\'s, let\'s call them ""weak arcs"".In 10 episodes you can\'t pack a whole lot into the show when it comes to arcs, but Japan sinks can be cut up into a few: The earthquake, the road trip, the cult, lost at sea, and then the ending arc. I may be pushing it, as the road trip got an episode and a half, but when it comes to 10 episodes, it felt like it\'s own mini-arc.Overall, the first 2 episodes are amazing, the destruction and the scenery coupled with Ayumu\'s response to it all was fantastic, and as someone who\'s never been in an earthquake, it definitely felt real to me.Where the story starts going downhill is with episode 4 and the introduction of the ""cult"", it felt so random to me, like a downplayed version of Negan\'s cult from TWD. From the moment they got there, I knew there was something going on, no-one would be so nice to random strangers, it all felt off, and of course it was.From FaZe_Grandpa who hit the sickest trickshots of the decade to the kid getting smashed in the most comedic way possible, it all felt like a wierd dream, like a wacky break or a distraction from the destruction that was going on.// Art : 5/10I thought about giving this a lower score, but that would be a bit harsh.I watched this show in segments, first episodes 1 & 2, then 3 & 4, then 5, then 6-10.When I watched the first 2 episodes, I didn\'t notice anything wrong with the art, it didn\'t feel wierd. When I watched episodes 3 & 4, it felt like the art got a huge decline in quality, as if all the budget had gone to first two.Maybe this is just me, and I need to go and check back, but when I watched episodes 3 & 4, what I first thought was ""wow the art was this mediocre?""Some scenes are done really well, especially in the early episodes, which saves this category from an abysmal score.I remember one scene in particular where Ayumu was arguing with her mom, and Ayumu looked so distorted up close, I paused and wondered if I should laugh or be horrified...// Sound : 5/10I didn\'t pay any attention to the sound whatsoever, I never do unless it\'s the Monogatari series. Since I have no recollection of what the soundtrack sounds like, i\'ll give it a 5/10As for the voice acting, it was all pretty average, the only one that I really hated was Go, but more on him later.// Characters : 6/10This show presented some interesting characters, before killing them off in a fashion that makes Attack on Titan look like Kimi ni Todoke.The dad\'s death scene striked me as surprising, shocking, and kind of unnecessary. It was at that point where I started placing bets on who would die next, new characters got bet on the most, of course.Ayumu and Nanami were the only characters that stood out to me, too bad Nanami got 1945\'ed.Go is the most annoying character i\'ve seen since Bam from ToG and he joins Deku and Bam in the list of characters I want to kick the life out of.His random bits of english are annoying and unnecessary. Ok, we get it, you can say ""dad"" in english, so can I. His english felt forced down my throat, I kept saying ""no"" and he wouldn\'t answer ""はい"", but he\'d answer ""yes"" instead.Overall, a decently forgettable cast with some fun betting along the way.// Enjoyment : 6/10I enjoyed the first two episodes, I hated the cult arc, and the rest was ""meh"".Joey (theanimeman) put it perfectly, ""it\'s the definition of a 5/10"".It is average / below average in most cases, and while I enjoyed certain parts, it wasn\'t a pleasant ride the entire way through.Howevern, this show has managed to weasle it\'s way into my mind, and I keep thinking about it.Overall: 6/10. Just above average, but not by much. anything i\'d seen so far. Come the release date, I had forgotten about it, and remembered it had released when I was scrolling through Netflix and remembered it was supposed to come out soon, and it had already released, so I started watching.// Story : 7/10The overall idea behind Japan Sinks isn\'t a bad one, i\'d say it\'s actually decently original when it comes to plot in anime. It loses points for some of it\'s, let\'s call them ""weak arcs"".In 10 episodes you can\'t pack a whole lot into the show when it comes to arcs, but Japan sinks can be cut up into a few: The earthquake, the road trip, the cult, lost at sea, and then the ending arc. I may be pushing it, as the road trip got an episode and a half, but when it comes to 10 episodes, it felt like it\'s own mini-arc.Overall, the first 2 episodes are amazing, the destruction and the scenery coupled with Ayumu\'s response to it all was fantastic, and as someone who\'s never been in an earthquake, it definitely felt real to me.Where the story starts going downhill is with episode 4 and the introduction of the ""cult"", it felt so random to me, like a downplayed version of Negan\'s cult from TWD. From the moment they got there, I knew there was something going on, no-one would be so nice to random strangers, it all felt off, and of course it was.From FaZe_Grandpa who hit the sickest trickshots of the decade to the kid getting smashed in the most comedic way possible, it all felt like a wierd dream, like a wacky break or a distraction from the destruction that was going on.// Art : 5/10I thought about giving this a lower score, but that would be a bit harsh.I watched this show in segments, first episodes 1 & 2, then 3 & 4, then 5, then 6-10.When I watched the first 2 episodes, I didn\'t notice anything wrong with the art, it didn\'t feel wierd. When I watched episodes 3 & 4, it felt like the art got a huge decline in quality, as if all the budget had gone to first two.Maybe this is just me, and I need to go and check back, but when I watched episodes 3 & 4, what I first thought was ""wow the art was this mediocre?""Some scenes are done really well, especially in the early episodes, which saves this category from an abysmal score.I remember one scene in particular where Ayumu was arguing with her mom, and Ayumu looked so distorted up close, I paused and wondered if I should laugh or be horrified...// Sound : 5/10I didn\'t pay any attention to the sound whatsoever, I never do unless it\'s the Monogatari series. Since I have no recollection of what the soundtrack sounds like, i\'ll give it a 5/10As for the voice acting, it was all pretty average, the only one that I really hated was Go, but more on him later.// Characters : 6/10This show presented some interesting characters, before killing them off in a fashion that makes Attack on Titan look like Kimi ni Todoke.The dad\'s death scene striked me as surprising, shocking, and kind of unnecessary. It was at that point where I started placing bets on who would die next, new characters got bet on the most, of course.Ayumu and Nanami were the only characters that stood out to me, too bad Nanami got 1945\'ed.Go is the most annoying character i\'ve seen since Bam from ToG and he joins Deku and Bam in the list of characters I want to kick the life out of.His random bits of english are annoying and unnecessary. Ok, we get it, you can say ""dad"" in english, so can I. His english felt forced down my throat, I kept saying ""no"" and he wouldn\'t answer ""はい"", but he\'d answer ""yes"" instead.Overall, a decently forgettable cast with some fun betting along the way.// Enjoyment : 6/10I enjoyed the first two episodes, I hated the cult arc, and the rest was ""meh"".Joey (theanimeman) put it perfectly, ""it\'s the definition of a 5/10"".It is average / below average in most cases, and while I enjoyed certain parts, it wasn\'t a pleasant ride the entire way through.Howevern, this show has managed to weasle it\'s way into my mind, and I keep thinking about it.Overall: 6/10. Just above average, but not by much.', 'This was a train wreck of a show. Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 has about a hundred natural disaster movies and series already existing at its disposal to examine and improve off of, but somehow it is astronomically worse than any other I\'ve seen.Story: 6/10I can see how the plot is supposed to progress: new people join the group while other people are picked off (wow, who next??) and die in relatively unique ways. They progress through sinking Japan trying to find their way out. Except what is the end goal? I understand that in real life it would be difficult to have an objective other...than ""survive,"" but the goal feels like it keeps changing. Often the show itself feels confused as to what it\'s trying to say so it just glosses over things and hopes the audience fills in the holes for them. I like the circumstances that they have play out, but the pacing is so atrocious they don\'t give enough time to support the most important moments, and elongate the most banal ones. It seems the way they choose which parts to stretch out are the scenes where the frames are completely twice-thrice reusable.Furthermore, I can\'t tell if they\'re trying to be believable or not. Apparently, according to this series, supposedly, super powers exists (but only for one person), THREE groups of people who are split on the open ocean can find each other in a short period of time, serious injuries don\'t affect you if you just don\'t mention them, and oh yeah... TANKS are easy to find, and it\'s a good idea to swim underwater with a paralyzed man on your chest (and expect him to live). But, you know, by the end of it we\'re supposed to have felt like we went through something amazing and teachable. Better luck next time.Art: 3/10Actually terrible. I understand these aren\'t your most conventional characters, but it\'s actually unbelievable how dirty they\'ve done them. When I started Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 I kept trying to convince myself that I saw Masaaki Yuasa\'s spark here or there, but by the end of the second I stopped trying. Characters don\'t react if something happens next to them. The in-betweening is atrocious. Eyes are pointing the wrong way. The most jarring and unsightly problem, is that the people themselves, their very skin, looks like it\'s literally falling off. Everyone looks WRINKLY. A good number of characters are given extra wrinkles on their chins. That\'s fine I guess, maybe it\'s the character design, but NO. It gets worse. Often the limbs are super thick and wrists, elbow bends, knee bends are made to look wrinkly almost like they\'re drawn as clothes. This is especially noticeable in the life raft scene. Why do this? Why?Sound: 3/10The music is incredibly uplifting and is meant to give the sense that living on and struggling is worth it because the future or something. You know, maybe you like the music. MAYBE. That doesn\'t forgive the fact that it\'s played at the worst times. Ever. Did a major character die? Maybe we should start playing music now. Did many people die as a result of this one event? Play uplifting music to ignore that fact and instead be grateful you\'re alive. The only time the music lined up with the visuals is at the very end, the only place it could ever fit.Characters: 6/10The characters in this series are like a two-edged sword. None of them are very three-dimensional. The only three-dimensionality of their characters\' personalities is very on-the-nose, and that\'s only because their cast is so diverse. The characters for the most part are very easy to tell apart, and some of them are very likeable.Enjoyment: 5/10I can\'t say I\'d rate it less than a 5 because one, I watched it all the way through, and two, the atrocious parts were still entertaining to watch. I would not consider this a legitimate show to get invested in though.So bad it\'s funny:Some scenes deal with intense weather conditions. Peoples\' faces get scrunched up in disgusting ways that cannot possibly be drawn by a professional animator. They look like trace-overs of that one Tom Cruise meme. If you pause at the right moment I expect you\'d fall over laughing.There are other languages used in this series. Mainly English. The English is really bad. It sounds like it came straight out of Dora the Explorer, but with that special Japanese twang to it. The phrases they say too make me think the translator of this thought it was satire. ""Oh No!"" ""You Can\'t Be Serious!"" ""Hasta La Vista Baby!""Overall: 4/10This is a shitshow. If you want something lighthearted, this is it at times but mostly is not. If you want something heavyhearted, this is it also sometimes but mostly not. While the situations and circumstances proposed are very interesting, none of the highs or lows have any sort of impact. The only time it got a real reaction out of me was when something was executed badly, and this was relatively often. than ""survive,"" but the goal feels like it keeps changing.

The only time it got a real reaction out of me was when something was executed badly, and this was relatively often.', 'After finishing this anime, I felt I wanted to write why I felt about it, or should I say, didn\'t feel about it. This is a somewhat lengthy review, so be warned.The premise of the story is very solid, due to an earthquake the landmass of Japan is sinking into the ocean. Not very original, but still, can be very cool if done right. It\'s just a shame it isn\'t done right.Many of the characters are never explored, you as an audience member never really get to know them. The main character of the story, she does have some plots that could have been explored...very effectively throughout the show, but they are rarely touched upon.It annoyed me that it is never really explored when, right as the first major earthquake hits, the main character\'s choices at the time, while a very human reaction, is arguably a wrong choice. This would have been a very good opportunity for character building.She\'s also injured very early on. It doesn\'t take much to realize where this is heading, it\'s made very obvious very quickly, yet this is not really anything they use. It pops up once or twice in the story, it felt more like a plot device for the ending than anything else.Being a disaster show, people will die, you know that going into it. And I actually do think the show did a good job of setting characters up well before killing them off. My biggest issue was that the show never gave you a chance to feel the loss of these people. If the characters don\'t really seem to give a shit (or the show creators at least don\'t give the characters the screen time give a shit), then why should I ever give a shit?If I\'m watching a show or a movie with a disaster theme, I fully expect to be on an emotional roller coaster! I want to share with the characters success, I want to feel the pain and loss of a loved one just like characters do.There are certain characters in this show (I was watching the dub, he might not have been as annoying in the original), a foreign character, he pissed me off something fierce. Had that dude gotten a boulder on his head, I would have cheered whilst others might have cried. Oddly enough though, a character that annoyed me to hell was actually the one character I remember the most from the show, and I\'m not sure that\'s a good thing for a show.There are also so many plot holes. I mean, the amount of plot holes in this show could make the Titanic seem like an unsinkable ship. Bad pun, I know, but I hope you get the idea.In the middle of the show a three episode story arc shows up, makes no sense whatsoever. It\'s about specific plants and magic powers, I don\'t want to say more than that cause I don\'t want to spoil it. And you might be thinking, ""magic power"".... In a show about an earthquake causing Japan to sink into the ocean, but this is indeed the chase.In this same arc, we explore a character\'s medical issue, and from a somewhat different and unique perspective then you would normally see. Although, it isn\'t really explored, cause even without saying anything and therefore spoiling anything, I cannot tell you if this side effect he suffers from is legitimate due to an obvious shortage of medication or something else.There are so many minor things in this anime that could so easily have been swapped out for a little bit more character development. This would make me infinitely more invested in the characters and therefore the story. But instead time is spent on what feel like totally insignificant plot lines that end up falling flat on the ground.Finally, I want to talk about the ending. I\'m not going to spoil it, but it\'s not really a spoiler saying that Japan sinks into the ocean, it\'s literally in the title of the anime. But rather than leaving it at that, they had to give it a happy ending, and in the end it feels more like a travel brochure for Japan than anything else. The last 10 minutes of the final episode might as well be nicknamed ""Visit Japan"". It felt awkward, out of place, almost like, the idea of a world without Japan is unthinkable, so something had to be made up to solve that.It could so easily have been written like a natural disaster that ended up destroying Japan (to be fair, a few neighbouring countries are also affected). The entire world comes together and united to help the survivors both escape but also relocate the refugees. That could have been a nice happy ending that also had a subtle political message to help each other out in need. Instead we got the travel brochure.Conclusion:If I was free to talk about spoilers, there is so much I could say of things I think are wrong about this anime. If I were to do a list of pros and cons of watching it, the cons list is so so so much longer. I gave this anime a 3/10. It had potential, but in the end, I\'m sitting here with one massive question on my mind, actually, two questions.Question one; What is the idea and the message that this anime wanted to give? Usually an anime has that plot thread that holds everything together, that helps keep the story on track while you sometimes explore a little bit to the side of the path you are on. But what was the overall plot for this show, cause I don\'t really know. It wasn\'t about Japan sinking, cause half the time, that didn\'t seem to be a plot point at all, oddly enough.Question two; Did the creators of the show have any idea what story they wanted to tell? Was it a travel brochure? Was it a disaster survival anime? Was it about people overcoming terrible odds?? The show was all over the place, it felt like the direction in one episode was so different compared to the following episode, that I got the distinct feeling the creators had no idea what story they wanted to tell either.Thank you very much for checking out this review. If you\'ve made it through this far, I congratulate you on your achievement. I just felt like I wanted to share my thoughts on this show after watching it. So this is as much for me as it is for anyone else to read and use. If you did find it helpful, then I\'m happy. If you think it\'s garbage, well, that\'s completely fine too.

This was my first review, way too long, I just needed to vent. ;-)', 'Masaaki Yuasa is one of the most famous of anime directors, and I\'ve long been a fan, so my expectations were high for Yuasa\'s studio Science Saru. I\'m not sure why, but a lot of the vitality his projects were known for ebbed a bit with this new studio. Ping Pong the Animation has been the best so far, and there are some decent movies like Tatami Galaxy—others have been middling affairs with decent animation or cinematic elements, but they hit rock bottom with Japan Sinks—or, alternatively, Japan Stinks, if you\'re so inclined.What audience were they aiming for with this turkey? There are loads...of unfunny english phrases, and since it\'s Netflix, I assume the core audience must be Western or American primarily—and those fat neck rolls the artists kept drawing on the characters were probably there to avoid alienating the American population, most of whom are fat or obese. Thanks for the homage.Netflix is a propaganda film site with a relative of Edward Bernays (Century of the Self is a good documentary on the subject) being the co-founder and former CEO. Bernays is a legend in pioneering propaganda and advertising, and Netflix, along with other companies, picked up the mantle and ran with it. I suppose most studio productions have at least small doses of propaganda that go unnoticed, but Netflix is not terribly subtle.Of course, while I tend not to see propaganda that\'s very thick in your average Japanese production, this is Netflix, so there\'s some subtext mixed in here and there. The Mutou family are mixed race, and in art, every decision has a meaning behind it. The point here was to challenge ideas of Japanese nationalism and to critique ""racist attitudes"" or inject anti-racist sentiment. The son, named Go, is drawn to foreign cultures (there\'s an odd fixation on Estonia), annoyingly says random phrases in english, and resents Japan to some extent, partly because of supposed discrimination or being treated a bit differently. These themes come up time and time again. An old man constantly makes ""insensitive"" comments about foreigners, though he\'s generally nice other than being a nutcase who shoots arrows at everyone. These themes of discrimination, criticism of Japanese, and anti-border sentiment appear in the cringe ""rap battle"" near the end of the show—similar to how social commentary is packed into the rapping in Science Saru\'s Devilman Crybaby.Most hysterical is a scene where a nationalist group is saying they will only let pure Japanese board their float, and they squabble with the mains over their lack of pureness. The mixed-race boy hopes they will sink, and they promptly blow up and sink lol. That\'s the kind of ""subtle"" commentary you get with this show. Unsurprisingly, plenty of Japanese have viewed this series as anti-Japanese, and I agree with them. It\'s certainly anti-nationalist and pro-multicultural.I think Netflix understands the Japanese aren\'t keen on this stuff, so they soft-pedaled the message a bit, having Haruo show some pro-Japanese sentiment in the rap battle; or Go saying he could be playing for some other country, but ultimately plays for Japan in e-sports; and while I thought the idea was that Japan would lose its identity as a nation and have to merge with the rest of the world, they quickly built artificial islands, and portions of Japan were rising back out of the ocean throughout the years. Either way, the themes of the series are inconsistent and almost nonexistent aside from political correctness—other than some vague notions of the ""resilience of the Japanese people"" or ""found family.""While I\'m sure it might be assumed I\'m rating this low because of the themes above, I honestly can\'t imagine rating this higher than 2 even if there weren\'t any tiresome subtext. The disaster genre has always been one of few ideas, and this one is... possibly more mature than the most barebones of environmental thrillers, since it\'s larger in scope and has SOMETHING to say, no matter how clumsy or slippery it is in its phrasing, but it\'s ultimately just a bad merging of the disaster film with melodrama and PC culture. It can be satisfying seeing the twisted and upheaved streets and ruins of the city, there\'s an element of danger and tension everywhere, and the scope of the show opens up widely towards the end, having the characters scrounge for resources and exploring ships and islands.The technical aspects are adequate enough to be enjoyed if this show had good enough writing and characters in the first place, but the art is often ugly, especially the characters and their neck rolls and hideous bulk. The Animation is sloppy or features a very low frame rate at many points, and I don\'t think the roughness ever carried much of an emotional strength—pivotal moments at the end with Haruo and Kite are kind of nice.This is supposed to be a sad, depressing melodrama, but it\'s not very well-executed. Having the characters get upset, scream at each other, feel guilty, etc., doesn\'t automatically make for good drama. Nor is it even really emotional. They display emotions, but there\'s no reason to emphasize with their plight anymore than you would when hearing about a random typhoon that killed 50 people in some distant country. These characters are artificial and lacking in personality. We spend so much time wandering around aimlessly, characters cycle in and out of the cast, often dying in sudden and unexpected ways. Frankly, I ended up laughing at the unintentional hilarity of plenty of the deaths, and most of the important ones were heavily telegraphed. It doesn\'t cut it to show people feeling sad and distressed. There has to be some reason to care about them.There are so many stupid events, it\'s hard to keep up with. The downtime in the... hippie/weed cult or whatever could have been skipped. It doesn\'t add much. Daniel is a tryhard clown and his routine is one of the most annoying I\'ve ever seen. A YouTuber seems an odd and unnecessary choice—other than for some advertising, just as they namedrop Amazon and Starbucks later on. The old man with the bow\'s subplot is too over the top to believe.All of the characters are annoying, but the strangest part is how the main character loses her leg by the end. It\'s telegraphed throughout as she checks her wound, and it gets worse every scene. Why doesn\'t she ever treat it? Who knows. It feels like the series is trying to fashion it into a symbol of her guilt, since she cut herself in the very first scene when she ran away and left injured classmates behind, and she\'s trying to avoid reminiscing. It\'s a moronic idea from the staff.There\'s simply not much this travesty does well. It seems deserving of at least a 2 for effort and some decent technical chops here and there. It can be mildly entertaining to see what happens next—it\'s a glorious train wreck in that respect, and not an overly long one. of unfunny english phrases, and since it\'s Netflix, I assume the core audience must be Western or American primarily—and those fat neck rolls the artists kept drawing on the characters were probably there to avoid alienating the American population, most of whom are fat or obese.

Either way, the themes of the series are inconsistent and almost nonexistent aside from political correctness—other than some vague notions of the ""resilience of the Japanese people"" or ""found family.""While I\'m sure it might be assumed I\'m rating this low because of the themes above, I honestly can\'t imagine rating this higher than 2 even if there weren\'t any tiresome subtext. The disaster genre has always been one of few ideas, and this one is... possibly more mature than the most barebones of environmental thrillers, since it\'s larger in scope and has SOMETHING to say, no matter how clumsy or slippery it is in its phrasing, but it\'s ultimately just a bad merging of the disaster film with melodrama and PC culture. It can be satisfying seeing the twisted and upheaved streets and ruins of the city, there\'s an element of danger and tension everywhere, and the scope of the show opens up widely towards the end, having the characters scrounge for resources and exploring ships and islands.The technical aspects are adequate enough to be enjoyed if this show had good enough writing and characters in the first place, but the art is often ugly, especially the characters and their neck rolls and hideous bulk. The Animation is sloppy or features a very low frame rate at many points, and I don\'t think the roughness ever carried much of an emotional strength—pivotal moments at the end with Haruo and Kite are kind of nice.This is supposed to be a sad, depressing melodrama, but it\'s not very well-executed. Having the characters get upset, scream at each other, feel guilty, etc., doesn\'t automatically make for good drama. Nor is it even really emotional. They display emotions, but there\'s no reason to emphasize with their plight anymore than you would when hearing about a random typhoon that killed 50 people in some distant country. These characters are artificial and lacking in personality. We spend so much time wandering around aimlessly, characters cycle in and out of the cast, often dying in sudden and unexpected ways. Frankly, I ended up laughing at the unintentional hilarity of plenty of the deaths, and most of the important ones were heavily telegraphed. It doesn\'t cut it to show people feeling sad and distressed. There has to be some reason to care about them.There are so many stupid events, it\'s hard to keep up with. The downtime in the... hippie/weed cult or whatever could have been skipped. It doesn\'t add much. Daniel is a tryhard clown and his routine is one of the most annoying I\'ve ever seen. A YouTuber seems an odd and unnecessary choice—other than for some advertising, just as they namedrop Amazon and Starbucks later on. The old man with the bow\'s subplot is too over the top to believe.All of the characters are annoying, but the strangest part is how the main character loses her leg by the end. It\'s telegraphed throughout as she checks her wound, and it gets worse every scene. Why doesn\'t she ever treat it? Who knows. It feels like the series is trying to fashion it into a symbol of her guilt, since she cut herself in the very first scene when she ran away and left injured classmates behind, and she\'s trying to avoid reminiscing. It\'s a moronic idea from the staff.There\'s simply not much this travesty does well. It seems deserving of at least a 2 for effort and some decent technical chops here and there. It can be mildly entertaining to see what happens next—it\'s a glorious train wreck in that respect, and not an overly long one.', 'After fully finishing this 10 episode series, I knew I had to write a review on it. This series touched me in the same way that \'Terror In Resonance"" did. Of course, I have never experienced anything that the characters did in either story, however, at the end of each one, I was in tears and counting my blessings. Nothing is more humbling than seeing someone else\'s life go to utter chaos. If you want a good anime to finish in a day, and don\'t mind crying every now and then, then please watch this show. I can promise you will not regret it. ', ""Japan Sinks:2020My lord, I've never seen such a promising idea muddled so much to the point I even hated it. Watching the trailer, I assumed I'd be seeing an anime version of 2012 or some action drama of similar nature and for the first few episodes, it dose. Sure a few characters die here and there but that's to be expected in a disaster movie.Where it really lost me was when the main cast stumbles on a cult city that worships a medium (which they doubt in the end anyway) and the story falls into this whole thing about drugs, rape, and some whole...family thing that made zero sense. When the story FINALLY picks up, it just stumbles around from place to place and plot point to plot point; the cohesive story sinks like Japan dose; Even the ending (which is dumb and brings characters back to life like wtf) is just a massive mishmash of photos and events that occur seemingly at random.On a tangent, the art style here is garbage; I understand that this anime was probably interrupted by the international pandemic but that leaves little excuse in terms of the story, which, aside from what I've already, makes no sense and is poorly paced.To conclude my review, I would like to make a suggestion. If this were a movie, cutting out the cult crap and spending more time heading to an end goal; this could have been a great story despite the Disjointed animation.My advice, if you're the casual viewer, you're okay skipping this one, you're saving yourself the time and effort. But, if you're a writer and want to see exactly what NOT to do; skip this as well, Go watch a good disaster flick like 10.5; it's better than this Netflix garbage and I hope this sinks beneath the waves 3/10 family thing that made zero sense.

You think the plot is that simple? WELL think again ,because storywise, this show is majorly on some fuck shit.It is chaotic the places the story goes. i honestly dont want to spoil much for you, but our ragtag group of people go from one place to the other. It starts out pretty strong though with a super chaotic first episode that was more...graphic than i thought, but then watching the rest of the anime is the equivalent of taking my head and twisting it inwards like im in a junji iTo manga or something.First it starts off fine, then the anime turns into Midsommar and Life of Pi, and 8 Mile  out of nowhere.What is even more wild is that sometimes, the characters literally go through conflicts that are just pointless and other times they end up in conflicts just to kill people off and that\'s it. It does this final destination thing where every-time a group photo is taken, people in the photo die, but you dont know who.What I do like is just how the anime does not hold your hand, some major characters do die in this,and pretty brutally i might add.But the down side is that the deaths are mostly for shock value, and you dont have the time to feel emotion because just how INSANE the story is.And when it is emotional, it feels kinda dumb, out of all the times a person died, i can count on one finger a death that i felt for, but then again it was because of some bull-crap that was not foreshadowed at all.Also this show does not have anything to take away from it, instead it has all of these weird smaller themes that are hinted, it feels like Japanese propaganda sometimes and other times there are just themes of passive aggressive racism that honestly made things more complex than it needed to be. For example, one of the conflicts is that the group need to get on the boat, but the people would only accept pureblooded Japanese people,but some of the main characters in the group are Filipino, so they decide to take one child because the children are mixed , but then the children get mad, so the guy kicks all of them off the boat, but honestly why wasnt the conflict more simple such as there was only room for the children, but didnt want to separate from the group so they stay together? The racism did not need to be there,its fine to have themes like that as long as you commit to it, but this show is literally  went so many places, that it basically showed me the world like Aladdin. There is this scene were the characters are just rapping about how you should be proud to be Japanese. Maybe this theme of nationalism was apparent in the original novel from the 70\'s but i doubt in that novel they talk about Youtube, Amazon or Starbucks.This anime was one that made me question if i was actually sane or not. AND IT FELT LIKE IT WOULD NEVER END. It keeps going and going and then it literally ends with a montage of Japan and a long ass monologue. And i was floored on how beautifully messy this anime was.The ending of the anime tries to trick you into thinking it had a theme about how people get you through tough times, which is not true in this show, because in the tough times, the main characters are usually saved by some deus ex machina  or by other characters.Speaking of which, the characters are pretty shockingly written.The main character Ayumu in this anime is one of the dumbest characters i have seen in a long time. Her good morality cause her to do some dumb shit, such as giving the last of all the group\'s water to some random people, contradicting herself on multiple occasions, and just doing dumb things without thinking at all.On one occasion she comes across a guy who can predict when earthquakes happens and he is right all of the time, and then after one pointless conflict, she thinks he wrong, and then the earthquake happens right after that and they basically wasted their time dealing with her and need to escape. You cannot make this shit up.As for the other characters, they basically either die before you get attached to them or are just bland, the kid is fine and all but as child characters go, the cuteness wears off when he starts to whine. Just like any believable story, the group comes across Japan\'s most popular Youtuber in the country, but just like any typical Youtuber he just turns out to be an asshole with a phone to look smart and no personality.There is also this gag comedian guy from England, who feels like if a child read the novel this was based off of, made an OC for comic relief,and then showed it to his father,and the father was like, ""you know what, ill put him in the show why not"". All he does in the anime is make childish jokes and i wanted him to die on multiple occasions. Two characters that i kinda liked a lot were the mother,Mari,and this other dude, who has glasses, these two actually for supporting character got a lot of development and in the long run their development really paid off. But the cast in this show is huge, and people are dying left and right. To prove how messy this show is, the father character,Kouichirou Mutou and even Mari are labeled as main characters when that is just not true because the story does not revolve around them, it revolves around their dumb ass child Ayumu. not to mention she probably got more screen time than the two of them COMBINED. I didn\'t even mention the morphine addict, the cult members, or that fortune telling child, its just wow.I think the problem when having these Netflix anime ONA\'s are that sure they may look better than other anime on television, but the downside to that is just how quality assurance is almost nonexistent. I know it\'s an original net animation, but i dont think that should be an excuse of how incoherent and ironically hilarious the direction is. I will never forget the scene where the old guy is suffering from morphine withdrawal in a truck and then it just quick pans to the others like it was a punchline in a sit-com. Also the characters are off model most of the time, and the facial expressions are ironically funny. Then everything became clear when  I realized that this shit was directed by Maasaki Yuassa,(NOTE after some research it turns out yuasa just supervised for this show and thats about it so i know for a fact where most of this style came from.)As for the animation, like in devilman crbrbr, There are times where the immersion of the show is completely broken when things look awkward.Now the first episode looked the most professional looking and there are other times here and there where the animators flex their talent,but i felt like the rest of the time, the show felt like it was going to just break apart at any minute, and other times i still couldnt help but compare it to, yes ""Ninja Slayer:the animation""This is the first time i can say for an anime that the sound is genuinely bad, so bad that the dub was the best part about it, yes the ""DUB"". Not only is it bad, but it is unfitting as hell.Most of the music is like this royalty free ambient music that you would listen to while studying, but it happens for so long at times that it bleeds into the tone shifts of the show at makes it feel awkward. If there was a happy moment or even a sad moment, the music would stay the same. There is even a scene at a nightclub, yes there is a scene where the characters go to a nightclub and smoke weed and the main girl almost gets raped, but any way, this guy plays some music but the music does not sound like nightclub music at all, it sounds like music you would hear at like a school fitness festival or a children\'s hospital office. it was so laughable. The dub is basically the most okay dub ever, it wasn\'t the best, the script was trash, but the actors did a good job. ""just like devilman crybaby""I dont know why even bothered watching this dub while i work on something else, because most of the time, i couldnt look away from my tv, Credit where credit is due, there isnt a single time where i got bored in the anime, there was something always to gasp at, to laugh at, and make you question your meaning in life. Never will i see an anime that has old guys shooting gunman with an arrow in an electric wheelchair, people feeding curry with weed in it to small children, people who shower with their clothes on, and SO MUCH MORE.And these things that I mentioned do not contribute to the story at all.This anime was just so messily written, put together, and the dumbass characters really sealed the deal on making it so bad that it is almost good.Overall-5I honestly think that i could watch this anime again.Ill watch it in Brazilian next time though. graphic than i thought, but then watching the rest of the anime is the equivalent of taking my head and twisting it inwards like im in a junji iTo manga or something.First it starts off fine, then the anime turns into Midsommar and Life of Pi, and 8 Mile  out of nowhere.What is even more wild is that sometimes, the characters literally go through conflicts that are just pointless and other times they end up in conflicts just to kill people off and that\'s it.

The straw that broke the camels back for me was when the ""Gamer"" Kid (IDK if u can call this kid a gamer, because I hardly got any redpilled vibes from him) asked to borrow his sisters phone to message his ""gamer friend from estonia"" to seek guidance...for where to go.

Secondly the language barrier would be huge to overcome, I mean yeah the kid speaks english, but I doubt many estonians do as well... and even if we consider all of these things plausible, Im pretty sure the timezones would be incredibly messed up, now granted most gamers are pretty into the hussle, spending hours on end, late at night grinding away at the game, however I still find it incredibly hard to believe that a japanese kid and a gamer from estonia would meet up online, and let alone become friends.

But a very sad watch indeed...', ""This was... something. Japan Sinks 2020 starts off with a bang, and moves at a steady clip. The first episode is some of the most evocative disaster film that I've ever seen. It really evokes the terror, confusion, and dread of a mass-panic situation. The use of chaos and social unrest, as well as honest portrayals of fight or flight, grief, and the realistic portrayals of violence and the indiscriminate brutality of disasters is spot on.Then the show goes completely off the rails. The big issue with the series is that it dedicates significant portions of its runtime AWAY from the disaster of Japan sinking...into the sea, which you might think is a really critical thing to worry about. But instead, it diverges to social commentary on Japanese bureaucracy, unexploded ordinance, and Japanese racism to foreigners. These are interesting topics, to be sure, but they are explored as intimately as a bull in a china shop.And these are the issues that the show handles well. The show also has a string of episodes dedicated to a pot-farming religious cult dedicated to talking to the dead, it discusses a character with morphine addiction, it analyzes the geological predictions of a mad scientist... It's very confused throughout, as if the team behind the anime couldn't decide what the show would be about, and just threw every idea they had at the wall hoping something would stick. And unfortunately, nothing did.It runs deeper than just the story. The characters themselves are also all quite flawed. Again, the beginning of the show is excellently executed on all parts, and everyone has a believable opening to the narrative. But death is omnipresent in Japan Sinks 2020. Main characters die with extreme regularity, to the point that any shock of their death is completely lost. Characters also begin to lose the structure, acting completely out of character, and doing extremely irrational things.

How is the Youtube extreme sports athlete also knowledgeable about advanced medical techniques, plate tectonics, poisonous gas, and Japanese culture? Your guess is as good as anyone else.The most shining element of the show is definitely the background art, showcasing beautiful scenes of idyllic Japan as well as abject horror and destruction. The scene of Tokyo destroyed, huge sections of landmass falling apart, and assorted destruction are A+. But the animation rarely backs up the beautiful artwork. Some scenes are rendered fantastically, while others seem choppy, and unlike the quality that I expect from Science SARU's team. The soundtrack is also lackluster; it is by the same artist who orchestrated Devilman Crybaby's music, but it falls more flat this time around, with only a few songs that were consistently exhilarating or tension-rising.All in all, this was unfortunately not a good show. It had a lot to say, but then tripped down a staircase trying to say everything at once. A shorter series focused more on the disaster, and focused less on the myriad subplots that misdirect from the core messaging of the film would have served the runtime of the show better. into the sea, which you might think is a really critical thing to worry about. But instead, it diverges to social commentary on Japanese bureaucracy, unexploded ordinance, and Japanese racism to foreigners. These are interesting topics, to be sure, but they are explored as intimately as a bull in a china shop.And these are the issues that the show handles well. The show also has a string of episodes dedicated to a pot-farming religious cult dedicated to talking to the dead, it discusses a character with morphine addiction, it analyzes the geological predictions of a mad scientist... It's very confused throughout, as if the team behind the anime couldn't decide what the show would be about, and just threw every idea they had at the wall hoping something would stick. And unfortunately, nothing did.It runs deeper than just the story. The characters themselves are also all quite flawed. Again, the beginning of the show is excellently executed on all parts, and everyone has a believable opening to the narrative. But death is omnipresent in Japan Sinks 2020. Main characters die with extreme regularity, to the point that any shock of their death is completely lost. Characters also begin to lose the structure, acting completely out of character, and doing extremely irrational things.

Careful SpoilersI\'m going to separate and tell my opinions on Story/Art/Sound/Character/Enjoyment/Overall, hope you enjoy it and sorry for my english.Story: I\'ve never seen such a predictable plot in anime before, since the episode 1 I could predict what would happen in the second episode or third or fourth, whatever, I was actually surprised because there were some things that were so predictable that didn\'t even have an impact on my experience in this show.Continuing, even with all this predictions, there were a lot of...flaws in the anime and things not explained, the dad died but where was the reaction ? Wasn\'t this suppose to be a psychological/drama anime, we couldn\'t see how they reacted and they literally moved on minutes after what happened.What are the chances of their mom finding them in the middle of the ocean?Where the fuck and how did Kite got a tank and how come he found them ?There are just so bad things in the story that I hate and/or aren\'t explained, but atleast the end wasn\'t that bad even tho it was predictable.4/10Art: What a disgusting anime, the animation is just horrible and the characters are so out of life, from the creators of Devil Man Cry Baby I didn\'t really expect a better animation but atleast give more life to the characters.The animation was so inconsistent, sometimes the water would be beautiful and then literally made by a 5 year old kid that just grabbed a crayon for the first time.I can\'t put my words together to explain how bad the animation was.Atleast the background animation was decent sometimes with the pretty colours.2/10Sound: Nothing special and nothing to talk about, the opening was average, not something you would listen to everyday or have in your anime playlist tho.4/10Character: Annoying characters, WHY ARE YOU SPEAKING ENGLISH that horrible, THEY HIRED RUSSIAN DUBS BUT COULDN\'T HIRE ENGLISH DUBS COME ONNNN.The girl main character was annoying as hell, the kid trying to speak english randomly was annoying as hell.I\'m not going that deep in this but in my opinion the only decent characters were Kite and the old man that 360 noscopes people lmao.4/10Enjoyment: Even tho everything was shit and there ain\'t much to talk about the enjoyment, I had some fun watching this and some good laughs with how bad the anime was and how I wanted to know if my predictions for the next episode were correct.4/10Overall: Im disappointed with this anime, I was not with high expectations since it\'s neftlix original and the same studio as Devil Man Cry Baby. I still wanted the show to be good and have a good plot with good characters.It was still an interesting anime that made me realize how this can really happen not to just Japan but to the whole world and that we shouldn\'t be envious and everytime we can we should help the others ;)3/10Hope you enjoyed it and again, sorry for my bad english and therefore not using ""expensive"" words. flaws in the anime and things not explained, the dad died but where was the reaction ?

But with ""Japan Sinks"" a new bar has been created for me.At first, I thought I could compare this anime to ""Tokyo Magnitude 8.0"" because they have a very similar setting. And I already realized in episode 1 what a stupid idea this was and that the comparison ended quickly.This anime is, without exaggeration, even worse than the American blockbuster -2012- which is one of the most famous movies, both for its budget and its inane...stupid plot.Well, let\'s get to the actual content and why this anime is, by far, the biggest waste of time you can find. I for one am very neutral and try my best to find all the positive and negative points while watching. The only good thing about the whole anime was the illustration of the destruction and the afterimages of the devastation. Some backgrounds have been quite beautiful and this is the only reason why the anime is a 2/10.[Story - 1]Alright, setting the concept is no great feat. But that the flow was then also ruined in such a way?  They threw everything into this plot that there is. Completely stupid and pointless character deaths that only serve as a shock factor and are even more nonsensical than those of ""Final Destination"". Then we had crazy people, rapists, cults, and crazy racists. The disaster was almost irrelevant because the focus was only on the biggest clichés of the FIlmscene. Of course, the execution of this was atrociously bad.  The entire sequence from beginning to end was catastrophic. Characters were simply slaughtered so that the others could talk about something, stare out of their socks in shock, and be done with it. And then it was on to the next shocking moment.[Characters - 3]There was at least an attempt to give the characters more depth and personality. The emphasis is on ""tried"" which of course failed miserably.  I don\'t even want to say which of the characters dies, so I\'ll leave it. Anyway, I have to address several points.The protagonist - is a failure of a late bloomer of puberty. I expected something like ""development"" from her, what I got was pure boredom and some of the worst dialogue ever. She will spend the rest of her life waving at a car from 900m away, like in episode 4, and wondering why it doesn\'t work.Her brother - what exactly is he supposed to be? The only thing he did was flex his endless plot armor.The Parents - The father may have been the dumbest person on Earth and should start reading Warn signs, but he was muscular. Does that give extra points? The mother could hardly be more irrelevant and her story arc at the end was... uhh.The senpai from school - He said something 3-4 times in the anime and that was it. His unfolding at the end was almost a comedy scene from ""Dave and Tucker vs Evil"".The White Haired Non-Protagonist with Infinity Plot Armor - My favorite character, but only because he brought almost no 30 IQ dialogue.The Grandpa - Legolas. Seriously, he\'s Legolas.The characters ultimately possessed minimal realistic traits but no rational behavior whatsoever, let alone useful interaction with each other.[Music 4]The intro is sub-par, was that supposed to be symbolic somehow?The Osts are good and a complete waste for this anime.[Animation 4] All the points were collected in the background design. The backgrounds did practically everything to the anime, along with the osts.The character movement animations are fluctuating from average, to painfully bad. Seriously, you should never pause in this anime.If anyone has ever paid attention to the car animations, please tell me I was hallucinating. I can create better car animations with my paint program than this.ConclusionIf 2012, Final Destination, and any random trash movie -let\'s say Doom Annihilation- had a child, it would undoubtedly be this anime. Not only did it collect the entire cliché package. No, it managed to have a bottomlessly disastrous execution and spit in my face uninterrupted. Whatever the creators were thinking with this work and storyboard, I feel insulted. I can handle even anime that I would describe as far below average myself. Even those have some entertainment value. But not this one, not by any means.I urge everyone to rather watch ""Tokyo Magnitude 8.0"", you\'ll get far more out of it.Enjoyment - 1 stupid plot.Well, let\'s get to the actual content and why this anime is, by far, the biggest waste of time you can find.

Very minor spoilers included.The premise of the show started off really really well. Before i stated watching, I though this was going to be a revolutionary series in ways... but i guess i expected to much. Episode 1 really set the mood and believe me, as someone who has experienced the terror of earthquakes, it gave me goosebumps. When I thought everything would continue for the building up on the such great groundwork of the intro, it all went slowly downhill from there.Story: 7I was on the edge of my seat...after the first episode ended but while the story progressed, the excitement and tension wore off. The events was starting to feel more like of a generic catastrophic-themed movies (like 2012, San Andreas, The Day After Tomorrow(pardon for using non-anime references, these really are what popped into mind while watching)). After the tension from the premise's events, it became more of adventure genre anime. This especially in the middle arc (Shin City). Even if you take out the episodes in the middle (from the only 10 episodes), the story wouldn't have changed much. The story slowly picked itself up towards the ending with all the events leading up to the resurrection of Japan. I was more or less satisfied with the way they ended things.Art: 7The first few moments, you'll get your eyes glued to the opening for its artstyle. There weren't much 'wow' moments for me considering the unconventional-ish way of animation (similar to tatami galaxy) and sometimes the artstyle is just plain annoying.Sound: 8Now the sound really set the mood for me. There weren't notable soundtracks being played but the moments when they play the sounds puts the thrilling vibe in the right place.Character: 6Japan Sinks 2020 is quite full of characters that they had to keep killing them off. With the constant pace the main characters travel in the series, they get to meet a couple of characters but don't give enough impact. The character development of the main characters (Ayumu and Go specifically), could have been done better. From the beginning to the end, Ayumu's perspective of things didn't really change much and the impact of the characters were less rather than the overall story. When 2 of the main characters died (especially the dad), there was so little impact on his leaving even considering that he would have been one of the more prominent characters that could make the story better than it is.Overall: 7I was just really let down after the tension and excitement of the the first episode but was still satisfied by the way it ended. The middle arc could have changed, or the direction of the story should have really changed in the middle where with or without the Shin City story, nothing much would have changed.I really recommend this show for those who don't mind graphic and gore clips. It's quite a breather from your usual anime. after the first episode ended but while the story progressed, the excitement and tension wore off.

Despite the ""plot armor"" some characters continually have throughout the show, it falls into the same Game of Thrones season 8 tropes of killing off characters to be ""unpredictable."" Somehow the same people continue to be saved by who knows what, and other characters are massacred by the hand of the belligerent writers. That said, it wasn\'t ""awful"" by any means.Story - 4/10The concept is fantastic. After all, it is a remake of the original novel, and the following 2006 movie. However, as an anime, it fails. I was drawn in within the first two episodes, and I desperately...wanted to know what happened next. However, within the following 8, I was given a whole lot of nothing. Random characters were thrown in, with the writers expecting me to care about them, and random plot threads were scattered about. Nothing really happens, and the story diverges from the post-disaster survival story I thought it was going to be. There\'s communing with the dead, and ghost ships, and people eaten by sharks at sea. There\'s a know-it-all youtuber (who inexplicably became my favorite character just due to how much he didn\'t care) who someone knows everything and has absolutely no purpose. I don\'t know how the plot progressed at all. It\'s literally as if I was teleporting between stories.Art - 5/10The first two episodes were really nice visually. After episode 3, it was thrown off a brick wall. The lighting didn\'t exist anymore. Character faces became blobs. From an anime made in 2020 as a Netflix show, it certainly did not impress.Sound - 6/10The music was good, if generic. It was never a centerpiece for me, and it never drew me in, or really highlighted anything for me. It existed, and that was about it.Characters - 5/10Straight up did not care if the characters died. None of them were unlikable per se, but I had absolutely no reason to care about them. Most of those that died were characters with minimal development. It was clear that the deaths were for shock value and nothing else. I grew to somewhat care about some of them, but it was nothing good enough for me to actually like them, or seriously care about what happened to them.Enjoyment - 7/10For some reason, I watched the entire thing in one day. It wasn\'t good, it wasn\'t bad,  the characters were alright, the story was a mess, but was conceptually good. I don\'t know what to say. Is it worth the watch? Probably not. Could you watch it and enjoy it? Yes. It filled my time, and at the very least, kept me entertained.Not awful. Not great. Mediocre. 5/10 wanted to know what happened next.

Other than that, this anime is a 10/10!Netflix kept suggesting this to me, and I kept ignoring it. Eventually I clicked on it and fell in love with the art.

The characters often act so illogically that it's almost an insult to the viewer's intelligence. It's as if the characters lack normal human emotions. Just a few minutes after a highly traumatic moment, such as a brutal death of an important character, the characters might appear to have completely forgotten that anything even happened. The promising first episode gave me false hope that the series would improve as it progressed, but unfortunately, it didn't. It's rare for me to feel that a show I've...watched from start to finish is a complete waste of time, but this one truly is! The animation quality is okay, but it doesn't redeem this show. watched from start to finish is a complete waste of time, but this one truly is! The animation quality is okay, but it doesn't redeem this show."", 'At first glance Nihon Chinbotsu appears to be simply a somewhat confused and disjointed disaster show. Like most disaster films and shows it\'s riddled with convenient coincidences and punctual evasions--but that\'s to be expected, so no grief given. Well, maybe just a bit of grief; this show seems to take it to a whole new level when it comes to quantity of ridiculous escapes, convenient timings and exceptionally moronic decisions made by our main heroes. Though, there is an actual motivation behind it all, which, theoretically, can excuse this. But more to that later.Furthermore, some classic tired tropes are present, of people becoming evil...rapists, thieves(as much as you can be considered one in the apocalypse), murderers and drunkards.The outlook here always seems to be that the threat of punishment, rigid rules and structures of a society is the only thing that keeps the evil tuns and do-no-gooduns among us from purging/stealing everything in their proximity. It\'s very shallow, but this, perhaps, is best reserved for a more philosophical discussion.Let\'s start with the intro: It\'s a nauseating thing and did not fill me with much hope; Ooh, just look at the beautiful mundane before we were punished by God almighty and the nature. Appreciate your boring life, you chump! Tea? Forever gone. Time? Ran out. This cat? Presumed drowned. Ain\'t that fucking sad.But, of course, I know better than to judge a book by its cover, or in this case, an anime by its opening intro. And maybe that is my mistake.Something did not sit quite right with me from the very beginning of this show. Like some kind of point was being made that I was missing. The chaotic randomness of deaths and various events seemed a bit too structured to be deliberately random. I entertained the thought of it being one of those creations where the grand goal is to be ""different"" or ""experimental"". But the odd sense of structure did not leave me.The realization struck maybe about six or five episodes in; the authors intent became clear to me at last. He was attempting to preach his interpretation of biblical morality of the west and its religions. And, on retrospection, I\'ve discovered that most of the events that had transpired were rooted in biblical allegory to some degree at least. The notion of not recognizing what this man deemed moral and amoral for so long still fills me with a sense of slight discomfort.The great flood(of course); thou shalt not be greedy; thou shalt not use the drug; thou shalt not have impurity of thought; thou shan\'t be a caricature of a racist; arrogant; have sex; thou shalt only feel happy when at work, upon performing thy noble sacrifice, or an act of martyrdom. A person\'s real redemption can only be achieved with their death. The exception here being the disabled Jesus, who is miraculously resurrected: as it is tradition. Kite--an angel modernized to take the form of a YouTube Vlogger, descends from the skies with help and blessings, then, humbly ascends back when the deed is done and necessary lessons learned. The list goes on. I wonder if there is a biblical event about riding a hog too. Maybe I should look into that one at some point.So, in summary: The maker appeared to be so preoccupied, obsessed even, with conveying his bizarrely crude morals to the viewer, that no cost seemed too large. The characters were thrown away at random. The same was done to any moderately intriguing plot-points also. The overarching story is a shambles, despite the concept itself being fairly straight forward as per title: Japan Sinks. Ironic, really, that the entire thing appears to me to be devoid of soul. Especially the main cast lacks any personality and is dull, but as aforementioned--they are just there to be used as virtue devices. A peculiar sacrifice to make, I say. Additionally, the journey is riddled with attempts to evoke this funny sense of paranoia that paints the world outside the pre-prescribed bounds of our civilization as some kind of hellscape that you mustn\'t mingle in, or Else. But if you happen to venture out anyway, you\'re most like to be blown up by some mine, or poisoned by the earth itself at random. So stay in your pen and fear the deadly world around you! Unless, of course, it sinks into the ocean.Then there is the resolution. Some kind of cheesy, strangely global, but also contradictory nationalistic Japan Olympics promo mess, paired with a very transparent, cheap sob-fest of excessive positivity and ""hope"". Lucky for me, I hardly cared about what was happening at that point.Though, with rigid preaching put aside, there are still some alright aspects of this anime that are worth a mention:The rap scene was delightfully cringey, but also different, it really took me aback--I like that. The art style served its purpose, I suppose. It was satisfying to figure out the religious theme beneath it all. The initial intrigue of the cult sub-plot was good, not sure how much credit it deserves though, given the \'resolution\'. One unusual choice that I\'d like to point out was the prolonged droning melody of the same piano chords throughout many of the episodes, the weird, stubborn tedium of which seemed unusual. It made me wonder if it\'s meant as a deliberate attempt at mood manipulation of the audience; or something that was done out of stylistic reasons which I could not determine. If it was the mood, it has misfired, but still, kudos for the strange perseverance.Overall I believe for this anime to be made by a sick mind, who is not very well acquainted with humanity. Not sure if it\'s a good thing or a bad thing. It\'s interesting. Not enough to like it though. rapists, thieves(as much as you can be considered one in the apocalypse), murderers and drunkards.The outlook here always seems to be that the threat of punishment, rigid rules and structures of a society is the only thing that keeps the evil tuns and do-no-gooduns among us from purging/stealing everything in their proximity. It\'s very shallow, but this, perhaps, is best reserved for a more philosophical discussion.Let\'s start with the intro: It\'s a nauseating thing and did not fill me with much hope; Ooh, just look at the beautiful mundane before we were punished by God almighty and the nature. Appreciate your boring life, you chump! Tea? Forever gone. Time? Ran out. This cat? Presumed drowned. Ain\'t that fucking sad.But, of course, I know better than to judge a book by its cover, or in this case, an anime by its opening intro. And maybe that is my mistake.Something did not sit quite right with me from the very beginning of this show. Like some kind of point was being made that I was missing. The chaotic randomness of deaths and various events seemed a bit too structured to be deliberately random. I entertained the thought of it being one of those creations where the grand goal is to be ""different"" or ""experimental"". But the odd sense of structure did not leave me.The realization struck maybe about six or five episodes in; the authors intent became clear to me at last. He was attempting to preach his interpretation of biblical morality of the west and its religions. And, on retrospection, I\'ve discovered that most of the events that had transpired were rooted in biblical allegory to some degree at least. The notion of not recognizing what this man deemed moral and amoral for so long still fills me with a sense of slight discomfort.The great flood(of course); thou shalt not be greedy; thou shalt not use the drug; thou shalt not have impurity of thought; thou shan\'t be a caricature of a racist; arrogant; have sex; thou shalt only feel happy when at work, upon performing thy noble sacrifice, or an act of martyrdom. A person\'s real redemption can only be achieved with their death. The exception here being the disabled Jesus, who is miraculously resurrected: as it is tradition. Kite--an angel modernized to take the form of a YouTube Vlogger, descends from the skies with help and blessings, then, humbly ascends back when the deed is done and necessary lessons learned. The list goes on. I wonder if there is a biblical event about riding a hog too. Maybe I should look into that one at some point.So, in summary: The maker appeared to be so preoccupied, obsessed even, with conveying his bizarrely crude morals to the viewer, that no cost seemed too large. The characters were thrown away at random. The same was done to any moderately intriguing plot-points also. The overarching story is a shambles, despite the concept itself being fairly straight forward as per title: Japan Sinks. Ironic, really, that the entire thing appears to me to be devoid of soul. Especially the main cast lacks any personality and is dull, but as aforementioned--they are just there to be used as virtue devices. A peculiar sacrifice to make, I say. Additionally, the journey is riddled with attempts to evoke this funny sense of paranoia that paints the world outside the pre-prescribed bounds of our civilization as some kind of hellscape that you mustn\'t mingle in, or Else. But if you happen to venture out anyway, you\'re most like to be blown up by some mine, or poisoned by the earth itself at random. So stay in your pen and fear the deadly world around you! Unless, of course, it sinks into the ocean.Then there is the resolution. Some kind of cheesy, strangely global, but also contradictory nationalistic Japan Olympics promo mess, paired with a very transparent, cheap sob-fest of excessive positivity and ""hope"". Lucky for me, I hardly cared about what was happening at that point.Though, with rigid preaching put aside, there are still some alright aspects of this anime that are worth a mention:The rap scene was delightfully cringey, but also different, it really took me aback--I like that. The art style served its purpose, I suppose. It was satisfying to figure out the religious theme beneath it all. The initial intrigue of the cult sub-plot was good, not sure how much credit it deserves though, given the \'resolution\'. One unusual choice that I\'d like to point out was the prolonged droning melody of the same piano chords throughout many of the episodes, the weird, stubborn tedium of which seemed unusual. It made me wonder if it\'s meant as a deliberate attempt at mood manipulation of the audience; or something that was done out of stylistic reasons which I could not determine. If it was the mood, it has misfired, but still, kudos for the strange perseverance.Overall I believe for this anime to be made by a sick mind, who is not very well acquainted with humanity. Not sure if it\'s a good thing or a bad thing. It\'s interesting. Not enough to like it though.', ""Japan Sinks is the anime equivalent of a 90s Hollywood disaster movie. Its art is unique. Just like the CGI that made those disaster movies work. However, once you look past the art style, there just isn't enough substance.The characters are mostly paper-thin cutouts. Who makes dumb decisions throughout the anime. Like why did Ayumu not get that cut treated even though she started working at a hospital? Why did Daniel not leave with the others? Why did the group choose an injured man to make the dangerous run and not the track team star?The Anime also tends to skip over crucial moments....Without spoiling anything, one of the main cast dies quite early on, which the protagonist blames herself for. This could have been an extremely pivotal moment for her. But it's brushed over so quickly. And isn't bought up again.Yet the main problem with the anime is the tone. One minute you'll be grieving and the next the characters are smiling and having a laugh. Traumatic moments are brushed to the sidelines.Overall, Japan Sinks 2020 fails to float.

The story, although generic by being an typical American Hollywood film  ""ITS THE END OF THE WORLD"" move that im used to watching a dime a dozen seems pretty, okay. There where a few hiccups in sound that sounded of, but it didn\'t really effect the viewing overall. The characters where not well developed especially in the way that they where introduced. If you\'re looking for something to watch because you\'re bored, and your favorite anime was delayed by the pandemic going around the world. Then i...really do recommend it because even though the anime wasn\'t that great, it did have me thinking that maybe one day i will pick up the book to read it, and see if it was different.The anime almost came off like it missed a lot, and its very obvious towards the middle of the show and some of the end, because the characters aren\'t really explained and just left behind in such a haste. I will give the original book a chance one day!. By the way as a native English speaker I really understand why I would prefer a high quality Dub than a Sub. Some of the stuff just will never make sense even if translated from Japanese to English and riddance. You will find out by tuning on the subs and having the English Dub set on Netflix.FIRST TIME REVIEWING ANYTHING IN GENERAL! So if you don\'t mind recommending my review to others or telling me why you think differently from me, that would be much appreciated. Thanks again everyone who will read this.

Going in I felt like this anime did have some promise, coming from the same studio that produced the likes of ""Ping Pong The Animation"" and ""Devilman Crybaby"", granted, both of those animations had different producers who really captured the essence of what they were trying to create. The same cannot be said for Japan Sinks.Barring the animation, which is an easy thing to nag on when it comes to this anime, I felt as if...a large majority of the characters weren\'t all that interesting, nor fleshed out to the point where they could be considered ""likeable"", besides Kite to a certain degree. Ayumu didn\'t hit the right chord with me, and came off as egregiously annoying majority of the time, Go was sort of similar, but showed more emotion with the more ""impactful"" deaths, and Koga had promise, but didn\'t get to fulfill it due to not speaking for nearly half the anime (outside of the terrible freestyle portion in Episode 9).Some of the deaths came off as unnecessary, or completely unavoidable. The Mothers death was quite possibly the most confusing thing to me, as she could\'ve survived had she gone up for air after finding the wench to the motor boat. The Dads felt a little brain dead, Daniel died after Shin City fell, and a majority of the supporting characters died in thaf Earthquake. Nanamis was so sudden and pointless, especially after her semi-epic moment at the gas station when axe kicking the truck driver.The most enjoyable thing about this anime is just how overly serious it was, the fact that an old man did a 360 quick scope on a guard who was literally six feet away, missing shots with a nine millimeter pistol, Daichi getting randomly killed by falling debris, and Mr. Onodera free styling with both Morse Code, and his eyelids. Moments like this killed any seriousness this anime WAS trying to go for, and it made the experience that much more enjoyable. I would recommend watching this with a friend, as I know that there will be enjoyment from this dumpster fire of an anime. Overall this anime did have promise, and the animation style has been proven to work with the aforementioned anime\'s above, but it felt rushed, and a little bit heartless. Overall I\'d say it\'s worth it to watch if you\'re wanting to find something so bad it\'s good, just be sure to watch this with a friend or group for even more enjoyment. a large majority of the characters weren\'t all that interesting, nor fleshed out to the point where they could be considered ""likeable"", besides Kite to a certain degree.

As a 10 episode anime series is a really good show with only a couple of hiccups along the way)]A mid to high 7/10. I understand where the low scores of 2 and 3 are coming from but really??, this show certainly has problems don't get me wrong but what is here is something else that you rarely get in other shows which is a sense of dread.This show evokes a sense of dread with its concept of japan sinking due to earthquakes and execution of watching a family doing there best to stay alive throughout these...circumstances. Now luckily i live in a place where earthquakes are pretty much impossible so i have never had to wonder about the ground just opening up beneath me, but wow! even though i cannot relate to these circumstances it still scared the holly bajeebus out of me just thinking about it.This is also emphasised by the fact that the show does not pull any punches. At times this show can get really gory and somewhat messed up although not to the same extent as other shows such as devil man crybaby. But still shows some pretty gruesome imagery.(character related spoilers bellow)Now the main complaint i have about this show is the characters. This is where i believe most of the low reviews about the show comes from. While i personally find many of the characters interesting the main problem is their deaths. At the beginning of the show a certain character seems to die for seemingly no reason as he didn't even finish his story arc. I see a lot of criticism pointed towards this death but i believe that this was actually a genius idea as after that scene i truly understood that no one was safe and the horrors that these characters may go through.But after the first death things do start to fall apart, the show just keeps insisting that people die and while at the start these deaths seemed like real legitimate things that could happen after a while they started to seem superficial with some characters that could have easily survived. Also the cult ark was kinda boring.Even with these negatives i believe that this shows concept and story are still engaging enough to make a very enjoyable watch that will keep you thinking days after watching it. circumstances.

Too many people are comparing it to devilman. The anime is meant to celebrate japan and not to be a devilman sequel.people say the story doesn't make sense but it does. It just has a couple plot holes. The anime is still enjoyable and meaningful. The characters aren't 10/10 but they still feel real. I don't think this deserves...a 6.6 on MAL and I don't think people should put it under a microscope like they do.   If the same anime came out without science saru attached to it then people wouldn't rip it apart. It's not for everyone but it's still a really good show that people expected too much from.The one critisim is the art is worse than other projects made by masaaki yuasa 90% of the time its good but sometimes the faces look really strange a 6.6 on MAL and I don't think people should put it under a microscope like they do.

The keyword being thought.  Unfortunately, I was utterly bamboozled.So boy oh boy, where did it all go so horribly wrong? Let\'s break it down below:Let\'s start at the beginning:You see, its deception lies in its opening. Because for all its flaws, I admit that Japan Sinks truly had an amazing opening. From the pacing to characters and art style; this show had all the potential of being the ""next big thing.""The beginning episodes were chilling with how well the writers managed to pull...off a suspenseful atmosphere. There was also a clear purpose in these episodes: we\'re introduced to the main characters (the Mutou family), the problem is immediately clear when the earthquake hits, and in its wake is utter destruction, so we can assume that what we\'re getting into will be a thrilling tale about survival.All in all, it was a gripping first impression. I believe up to this point, the show reached its peak. But then the second half came. And all I have to say is, what the bloody fuck?*Spoilers ahead*Taking a turn for the worse (the remaining 3/4 of the show):How did we go from a story (seemingly) about surviving a cataclysmic natural disaster with interesting family and character dynamics, to a silly and over-the-top shitshow with just too many plot holes for one to ignore? By episode 3-4, the show spirals out of control in the most absurd, abrupt, and dysfunctional way possible. It sacrifices plot and characters for shock value and it gets old pretty quick.The ""shock value"" is killing off character after character. Was this necessary? No. Did it serve a purpose? Not really. Did it even manage to frazzle the other characters for more than 2 seconds? NOPE. So why should we, as the viewer, even care about the deaths if the main characters don\'t? They act like emotionless robots, impossible to sympathize with! Oh, so you just witnessed your dad or husband literally being BLOWN TO BITS and it\'s like ""okay let\'s move on""?Characters:And that\'s a huge problem Japan Sinks suffers from. Characters come and go; they react passively and are only really there for shock value! They don\'t feel like real people or to have any semblance of depth to them.This is especially the case with the character Nanami. She\'s like a friend to the family who embarks with them on this journey. She gets ASSAULTED and the scene gets pretty damn violent and another character (the mom) had to rush in to help, but after that, it\'s never mentioned again. So then, we are left to wonder why that was even put in there? Not only did it feel out of place, but it didn\'t seem to leave any sort of impact on the characters involved so what was the point of even including it??Then, of course, Nanami also dies a few frames later. She just collapses and it\'s explained because of poisoned gas. So was her character just there for shock value?And then we get introduced to Kite. By the worst character of this entire show.Ah, where to begin? Let\'s just say that if you ever thought Kirito was a bad character, Kite takes it to a whole new level. You see, I\'ve noticed that Kirito getting a lot of flack for being too overpowered but goddamn, Kite takes the cake on this one. He\'s a Youtuber that\'s also apparently a superhuman. Everything about his character is unrealistic and far-fetched. The introduction to his character says it all: we literally meet him as he is paragliding through the sky and lands to bestow his infinite wisdom on us. Yup. He just happens to have a parachute in the midst of a catastrophic crisis (and ABANDONS IT a second later) and he just happens to know there\'s poisonous gas in the area to explain the Nanami situation.This guy is just . . . unbelievable. Think Kirito x1000. His whole character is explained as someone who just knows everything so we don\'t need to question how or where he attained any of his information. He\'s just so ""lucky"" and so he keeps doing James Bond sequences every few episodes and gets away without a scratch. Oh, and we find out that he has had several chances to leave Japan but decides to stay this long because he was bored . . .As for everyone else, what can I say? They\'re either forgettable, psychopathic, annoying or dead-- or all of the above.Let me sum them up real quick. Ayumi, the main protagonist is an immature girl that complains and whines a lot while always wanting to have the moral high ground against everyone. The brother, a gamer edgelord who hates his country. The other dude that wore bucket hat who had the personality of a sad E- boy. The mom and dad (they\'re probably the best ones out of the lot, but yeah, you guessed it, they both die). And finally, a psychotic old man who is also a pothead and murderer.Also, because this show overused the death toll, you quickly stop caring. Therefore ""powerful"" moments were reduced to ""oh, here we go again"" instances. I felt the most impact when the Dad dies because that was earlier on in the show but by the time the other major characters were offed, their deaths did little to nothing like what happened to the Mom or Sad E-boy\'s death scenes.PlotThen comes the plot. Oh my god, what were they thinking? Instead of a survival-based, post-apocalyptic journey, WE GET INTO A CULT? What. The. Hell.And why did this arc have to take up so much fucking time? All the characters do there is eat, sleep, work, and smoke a bunch of weed! This wouldn\'t be so bad if they just did that. But nope, they had to just overcomplicate and layer shit on.Because then, we get introduced to this lady who performs voodoo magic and the writers make a point to say her ""powers"" are legit. The lady is also the cult leader who later gets a sex scene and ""Kill Bill"" samurai sword fighting scene. There\'s also the question of how that cult had seemingly endless amounts of food and supplies. How they still had high-class technology even though they were in the middle of nowhere. How their land was so unaffected. So many questions; not a single one answered.After the cult arc, we have a, like, boat arc? Honestly, at this point, the story is so convoluted I don\'t remember exactly what happens. Basically, the big plot point was when Ayumi and her brother get separated by everyone and they have to survive on a raffle boat for awhile. And bruh. The old man accompanying them dies almost immediately, there\'s a leak in the boat, birds attack them, and then a SHARK attacks them too! BRUH.They eventually regroup with the gang (this was just too convenient), the mom dies, and when they meet up with Kite again, HE MANAGED TO HAVE FOUND A TANK. A tank! A fucking tank in the middle of the ocean!Then the couple last episodes were them having a rap battle and trying to get this chip with super-duper important information on it, Bucket Hat Boy sacrificing himself, and then Kite pulling sacrifice card himself. The siblings get rescued and we get cut to an ""8 years later"" sequence.I\'m not even going to comment on all this. I don\'t think I have to.Production QualityThe animation is really inconsistent. Sometimes beautifully detailed (mostly in the beginning) then goes to shit. Facial expressions look weird or emotionless. The human background characters were awful-- literal blobs of color and not in the innovative, artistic way--- it just looked lazy.The soundtrack is mediocre, decent at best. Yeah, I\'ve got nothing else to add here.Final ThoughtsTo sum things up: I sat through the entire half in utter disbelief at the clausterfuck unraveling before my eyes. And it was even more painful when comparing it to what it could\'ve been. If only the writers took time to develop the characters and to actually take into account what a plot is-- we wouldn\'t be in this mess.Alas, it seems like I was asking for too much. It also seems like Masaaki Yuasa keeps disappointing the hell out of me-- first Devilman Crybaby, now this crap.I\'m giving it a 4/10 for the amazing beginning and rare occasional good scenes, but as a whole: this is pretty much garbage. I highly advise you to skip it. off a suspenseful atmosphere.

I highly advise you to skip it.', '(first,i\'m sorry for my bad english,i\'m half japanese half french,so english is my weakness but i need to say what i\'m about to say)this show deserved a 1,but the first episode was good so i gave it a 2.first sin: Yuasa-sensei is not the director of this monstrocity,netflix lied to us shamefully.the story is meh at best,the characters are annoying,specially the kid,he made my japanese blood boiled,because according to this show it\'s so old school to speak japanese in japan,only old japanese fools speak that language (i\'m trying really hard to don\'t punch my computer while writting this).so as i saw everyone dying,i was like...""maybe David will die...banzai!""...and then i stopped for a second and thought that i wanted this little kid to die...me...i just cry everytime i  listen to ""secret base"" (anohana ED).but the characters are so bad that i was just waiting for them to die.speaking of characters,most characters are foreigners (my japanese blood is on fire now)exept for the old school dinosaur that speak japanese (this old idiot).so let\'s say that,according to this show,the inhabitants of japan are foreigners (i dropped this show at episode 4).so the show is bad,bad direction,bad script,bad story,bad characters,bad imitation of Yuasa-sensei\'s art style.but this is not the main problem for me,and the main problem is netflix (and also crunchyroll).think about it,why did you western people became fans of anime?well,because it\'s different,and it\'s different because of the japanese cultur and the japanese standarts.that\'s why anime is our favorite media.so now, i\'m happy with american companies investing money in anime,because the anime industry face a big crisis...i\'m happy as long as they don\'t interfere with this media,but this is the case here.this show was made by a japanese studio,yes,but as i was watching,i was thinking ""this is an american cartoon"".and then episode 4.the shower scene in the cult place...since when people are taking a shower fully dressed?you\'ll never see that in an anime.but you just feel that netflix was behind saying ""eeew,no skin please""and then i dropped the show and almost threw a knife at my TV.an animation with american standarts is not an anime! it\'s not the media that i love so much.if i wanted to see an american cartoon,i will have watched an american cartoon,but i wanted to see an anime.as the anime industry face a big crisis,this kind of practice is really bad for this media.if it continues like this,they will destroy anime as we know it,and i really don\'t want that.so please,boycott this show (and crunchyroll originals,they are pretty bad anyway) if you want your favorite media to stay the media that you fell in love with.and for the reviewers saying that bad review comes from misunderstanding of Yuasa-sensei\'s work...you just gave it a 10 because you thought he was the director (non-objective rating),and he is not.

Some spoilers below:I felt there was too much focus on side characters, like Daniel and the other cult members, which felt super out of place, and not enough focus on the protagonist. For example, there's some hints that Ayumu has feelings for Haruo, when she's making angry jealous faces at Nanami during their flirtatious scenes, but that string is never really pulled on.The artwork is mixed. The scenery is wonderfully done, but the characters and actual animation during action scenes is pretty basic.The soundscape is brilliant. Oftentimes, there's...positive sounding music juxtaposed on horrific scenes, and it feels like it shouldn't work, but it somehow fits beautifully.Overall, its an okay anime, but could've been a lot better. positive sounding music juxtaposed on horrific scenes, and it feels like it shouldn't work, but it somehow fits beautifully.Overall, its an okay anime, but could've been a lot better."", 'Overall- 7/10If you do plan on seeing this I recommend watching it in one sitting and just watch it. But when you get to the middle ""arc"" it doesn\'t make that much sense so I would say just let it play and wait for it to just pass through to get to the better parts. But give it a try it is worth the time.**SPOILERS**Story- 6/10I feel like the story is pretty straight forward and it has many good plot points. The thing that ruined it the most was the cult episodes. But when the kid got hit by the rock should have won...an award for the best comedic scene.  And the deaths were well placed in the begining but the characters didn\'t react very well, for example when the dad died it shocked me and I was expecting the family to be really sad for a while because their dad was really involved and seemed like he knew what he was doing but after a day everyone just seemed over it like nothing happen. But towards the end, it seemed like they were just killing people off but out of nowhere people to get emotional on characters that weren\'t that developed. But some concepts about what happens were interesting because you can see them happening,  like the group of people that only wanted to save pure Japanese people or as I call them, the Japanese KKK.Art- 7/10I love when Masaaki Yuasa is on the team because I love his style and how he can direct shows to have a strange style and still be good and fluid. He can take manga that was said to not be able to be animated or animated in a way that gives justice to the original source. But I do think this is the most ""normal"" looking one he has directed but I still think it looks Beautiful.Sound- 8/10Kensuke Ushio\'s pieces are so amazing words can\'t describe how good he can make music that fits every scene and emotion the show is trying to give. For example, this man has done Space Dandy, Ping Pong: The Animation, A Silent Voice,  Devilman Crybaby, and many more.Charcters- 5/10Ayumu was really hard to stand throughout the story same with Gō her brother. I quite liked Haruo special his running scene hit like a truck. Mari was a fun character but her death was too soon because we didn\'t get enough time with her same with Kōichirō, at least his death ones a good one because it was out of nowhere but didn\'t seem forced. I loved kite a lot, he was a fun character but probably was the most unrealistic one. He did carry the show tho and was probably what saved it for me character-wise.Enjoyment- 8/10The first scenes with the earthquakes were really powerful special with the music. The concept was really cool and if you can just ignore the few annoying characters and see the show for how beautiful it is and just sit back and enjoy it will be a fun experience. The beginning episodes and last few are really really good just the middle is ok especially if you like going in-depth and ""lore"". an award for the best comedic scene.

Sure, you'll get hurt, not everyone who's going with you will make it but that's only natural.Nothing lasts for forever - not Japan, not a religion, nothing can protect...you from changes except for keeping your sanity in check and not giving up.This show was vague about a lot of things - it didn't explain everything, sometimes didn't wait to build up certain themes. It can bother some viewers but to me, it was a great feature. We get to know characters through their actions, not their backstories and also it urges the audience to look for small hints and details. Also, it added greatly to the symbolism in the show.This show is constantly balancing between being realistic, symbolism and at the same time, it uses a lot of tropes familiar to us from catastrophic and post-apocalyptic movies and series but rereads them in a refreshing way.I also the fact that this show is not tragic and serious all the time and it allows characters to have fun. Guys... seriously? First of all, it's a coping mechanism. Secondly, it's only human not to cry all the time. Tragic events don't give everyone instant depression. It's only natural to keep pretending everything is all right just for the sake of one's mental health. It also made me enjoy the show more, I'm not saying that it an angst trip instead wouldn't be nice to watch but I liked how much this lightness was compatible with the art and animation.Moreover, I honestly think the direction was good and greatly emphasised the fast pacing of the show. Not as good as Devilman's but consistent and was successful in building up the tension. By no means, it should be called amateurish as I have seen in previous comments. This was clearly above the average and I find it a little bit hypocritical for people to hate on this show after getting so hooked up they watched it in one day. I don't want to sound badly but I would like to kindly encourage people writing those hate comments to read some textbooks about films, directing etc. I did so in my university days and it's an enriching experience that really makes you get more from shows you and opens your eyes to details. // Wow, that sounded so posh, I'm sorry >....<I don't want to make it horribly long so I'll just say that if you don't hate on it instantly, you might find it wholesome. It's sad at times and funny at the same time. It's not a show one can find every season and if you prefer run of the mills shows with usual anime problems like demons killed boy's family and now he needs to grow and become strong while protecting everyone - this might not be for you. It doesn't mean it's bad, it means it's different.But if you like things that are more ambiguous, realistic and symbolic at the same time, where the plot is not fair and things may always go down - this might be for you.It's not the show of the year but for me, it's one of the best since the covid anime crisis started.Also, it has a grandpa who's archery master and a youtuber who loves kites. you from changes except for keeping your sanity in check and not giving up.This show was vague about a lot of things - it didn't explain everything, sometimes didn't wait to build up certain themes.

Themes that are normally not touched upon in anime are finally presented in a meaningful perspective through this show. The series touches explicitly upon themes pertaining to Japan such as cultism, cultural identity, and racism. The disasters are merely a backdrop where these themes can be exacerbated to tell a story.Even viewing this series in the context of it purely being a disaster series, the series does a great job of characters actually experiencing...gargantuan cataclysms. Characters do not have kneejerk emotional reactions to grave and depressing scenes. Rather in a more realistic depiction, characters take a lot of time to process what they are seeing before finally expressing those emotions episodes later. gargantuan cataclysms.

Rather in a more realistic depiction, characters take a lot of time to process what they are seeing before finally expressing those emotions episodes later.', 'On the whole, Nihon Chinbotsu/Japan Sinks 2020 is a terrible show. If you have nothing else to do for 3 1/2 hours, then by all means kill that time with this. It\'s hilariously bad at times, but it\'s not so bad that I\'d recommend watching it unless you really do have nothing else to do. Considering that it is *2020* (roll credits and eyes please), you just might have a lot of time to kill.But there are two, yes that\'s right, exactly two scenes that are good. Unironically good. They are the first half of episode 8 and one scene around the middle of episode...9. Take out those two scenes, however, and my overall score would drop to a 1. The overproduced first episode may seem to have some redeeming qualities as well (e.g. its fluid animation mostly free of CG that sets the bar too high for most of episodes 2 through 7 and some sections of the last 3), but since the first impression of the show it gives the viewer, an impression of a somewhat grounded disaster story, is betrayed by everything that follows, episode 1\'s surface level merits fall flat as a broken promise. But does that mean they were trying to subvert our expectations? That\'s a no. The themes of perseverance, familial bonds, and what I can only describe as a ""neoliberal national identity message"" that all fell flat on their sugar coating by the end would have at least been somewhat coherent if the semi-realistic tone set by the first episode continued until the first half of the eighth and if the deus ex machina driven third act that followed had some serious rewrites.The first episode was not a misdirect. It was a fluke.And yes, I know that ""neoliberal nationalism"" sounds contradictory, but I can\'t think of any other way to describe the condemnation of Japanese nationalism as a grand narrative that the show portrays throughout almost its entire runtime (pressing right on the nose at times, more subtly nudging it at others) only for the final episode to cap it all off with a self-congratulatory montage of the proverbial land of the rising sun *rising* again as a rejuvenated nation state. All at once the show\'s surface and subtext on the alienation from and the arbitrariness of nationalism are overwritten as though the message all along was that predicating one\'s identity on a national narrative is a-okay so long as that nation is making socially progressive steps... What? In episode 9, the protagonist Ayumu even spells out what seemed to have been the point up until then, that national identities and narratives are arbitrary, and that fostering personal connections and communities is what really lends people strength in times of need... The writing is just so confused.Still, those two good scenes (mostly) hold up even in the messy context of the rest of the show. The one from episode 8 is just 9 minutes of the two main characters, Ayumu and her younger brother Gou, stranded on a life raft/tent, floating over a flooded Japan. Their dialogue as shell shocked children who have yet to fully process the recent events is convincing as are the performances of their Japanese voice actors (I can\'t speak on the English dub, however). Throughout this scene that is implied to last at least a few days, the dehydrated and malnourished children shoot flares, blow rescue whistles, signal SOS with their dead father’s flashlight, and just generally grope around in the dark. In one particularly touching moment, the two gaze at the kaleidoscopic bioluminescence of zooplankton beneath their raft, reminiscing on how it looks like the lights in their backyard, and then they talk deliriously about all the brands, conveniences, and people that children would understandably miss. This is the most meaningful, uncontrived moment of characterization in the entire show. This scene of them just surviving and interacting as siblings would interact even despite the circumstances (they even brush aside the cynical thoughts they do have that most other “kids” in modern anime would spend several monologues angsting in).The other good scene in the episode after doesn’t quite reach the same level. It’s the scene of Ayumu’s track and field upperclassman who has gone from being mute hikikomori at the start of the plot to a humdrum male with a “can-do” attitude after being flipped upside down by the plot… At least it’s not the most unbelievable thing the “plot” pulls, but I’m not here to point out the obvious flaws, the contrivances, and coincidences of this show here. This scene is supposed to be good, right? Well, it’s a little cheesy, but it works. For context, I gave the sound a 6 because it’s an umbrella category for the sound effects, voice acting, and soundtrack. I would give the sound effects a 6 (nothing special although the tremors stood out as believable and chilling), the voice acting a 6 (some of performances were okay and in the case of the raft scene really good, but many of the side characters like Daniel were unbearable, and the material all the voice actors had to work with was usually terrible: “hasta la vista, baby” was a real low point), and the soundtrack a 7. The typical thriller pieces notwithstanding, many of the scenes, even the over dramatic and gruesome ones, are accompanied by piano driven ambient tracks that are so tonally-dissonant they actually work as a kind of soothing contrast, which brings me to that good scene in episode 9 (See? It’s all circles back). In it, our can-do male character runs out to the sea to retrieve a plot-importance macguffin before a roaring tide can sweep it away. Since this happens presumably years after him being a shut-in, this is an effective catharsis. One of those piano driven ambient tracks kicks off with his sprint, but it’s a more beat driven track this time. As he runs, he recalls the audio commentary from him winning a race this one time that plays over the scene along with the ambient track, and of course he dies in the end. He wasn’t a memorable character, but that one scene revealed something human even if it was a bit heavy handed.I could continue, but it’s all downhill from here. I don’t see the point in redundantly complaining about media when I know there is much more already out there that I will enjoy, more than I could experience in my own lifetime. Besides, there are plenty of reviews on this site that cover the many flaws of this messterpiece. That said, maybe try watching that opening scene from episode 8. For a full 9 minutes it gives a glimpse of a more grounded, more effecting story. But on the whole, this show is anything but. 9.

I don\'t mean to say the actors are bad, they\'re not.

Sometimes you take a quick break to expand the ""arcs"" of other characters, but they\'re thrown around the story a moments notice.  I think the idea was to create some ""tension"" but it could\'ve been just me cause I completely missed it. The story is all over the rails, and it would make sense. The characters are in a race against time. But even in the most tense of situations, the emotions fell on my deaf ears.Art: decent. but quality either dips slowly w/out you realizing it, or maybe it\'s because the closer i got to the end, the more lazy the animation looked. and this applies to both the 2d and 3d animation. Sometimes is nice and fluid, and other times it\'s choppy. But it gets the job done.Sound: i\'m not really sure what to write hereCharacters: annoying.

Did you get it? Did you cringe? Yeah me too, and I\'m ashamed of it, and I only wish to take it back but now it\'s etched into history forever, at least I now know what it feels like to be the writer of Japan Sinks 2020.This show is a good example of what would happen if the Japanese anime industry had its own Netflix type...production, where you get a director with skill in some cinematics and then they expect their name or style will get them any further with any other concept, you can\'t grow in the anime industry without growing your style.Japan Sinks is probably one of the most underwhelming, lacklustre, and forgettable shows to have come out in recent years, grabbing a hold of a generic concept and executing it in a generic way making probably one of the hardest shows to sit through without snoozing off and dreaming about something even slightly better, such as Darling in the FranXX. You\'d expect something innovative from a show such as this when it was adapted by some of the same people as the ones who wrote Devilman: Crybaby, and even some writing links to Dragonball Super, so even something innovative and unique to SOME extent, but what you really get is something that looks produced by the typical underpaid Netflix director with their underpaid staff and their daily quota to continue living off of instant noodles, because even if this is untrue it feels like a cheap money grab at a demanded concept and at a low price, budget feels a little short off of Mars of Destruction.My biggest issue with Japan Sinks isn\'t how disposable and cheap it is, but how horribly the development is handled, the concept in itself isn\'t so bad but it\'s how they handled developing it which sets me off from this show so badly, each of the characters are so monotonous, typical to their archetypes, and forgettable, it\'s almost like I could predict every second line they said, in-fact I actually did try my hand at that once or twice during this show. So just go ahead and combine this with the terrible excuse for plot development and lo and behold you get Japan Sinks, a great display of when you pull concepts out of your ass and don\'t question it, just expecting to be the new hit-by-chance in the anime medium, like seriously, if you watch this show for 4 episodes you can notice multiple concepts which are just so outlandish and ridiculous to the main premise it\'s hard to take seriously, where the hell did the rock lab come from and how did they manage to get there of all places?! So many gosh damn ass-pulls and unlikely events occur that not only is it hard to take seriously, it\'s easy to roll your eyes in disgust at the lazy half-asleep writing.Seeing as I started with a joke and continued to discuss a joke, I think the joking has finally come to a conclusion and I am going to say it straight, Japan Sinks has horrible writing and a terrible development scheme, while the concept can be executed well as it has been a few times it definitely wasn\'t here. production, where you get a director with skill in some cinematics and then they expect their name or style will get them any further with any other concept, you can\'t grow in the anime industry without growing your style.Japan Sinks is probably one of the most underwhelming, lacklustre, and forgettable shows to have come out in recent years, grabbing a hold of a generic concept and executing it in a generic way making probably one of the hardest shows to sit through without snoozing off and dreaming about something even slightly better, such as Darling in the FranXX.

The trailer on Netflix looked like this would be an exciting thrillride with high steaks and lots of hardships. I ended up pretty disappointed. As this show became a bad roller coaster of killing off characters, unrealistic behaviour, annoying characters and weird loopholes.My biggest problem is how this show kills off characters. Every time someone tries to be meaningful for once, they are rewarded with a horrible death. Trying to get food? Die in an explosion. Want to save the main group from a sinking ship? Die of disease. This is literally a pattern that continues...throughout this show. There is also this big cult arc, which just exists to introduce more characters to kill off. I get they are taking a realistic approach in writing, but when that justifies killing off characters for no good reason, that's going to be a problem.Speaking of realism: here's a question: you're running from the water and you try to get food, but in the process one of your family members dies a horrible death. How would you react? If it comes to Japan Sinks: 2020, that's simple: just continue like nothing happened. No mourning or anything, just go along minding your own business. This is also a thing that keeps happening and makes the characters feel a lot less believable.I also have a problem with some of the characters in this show. Specifically Gou. He is a gamer and reverse weeaboo. He also throws a lot of English words in his language. In JoJo's, it's mostly for comedic purposes. But with the way Gou uses his English, it comes off as kind of annoying. His reverse weeaboo aspects are also really prominent, but it only comes up in a rap battle.There were also other things I found rather questionable. I could not really get behind how Japan would sink first of all. This show tried so hard to be realistic but then the way Japan would sink is completely unrealistic. I also had questions about the cult arc like: if the earthquake affected everything from Okinawa to Hokkaido, why is the location of the cult completely untouched?Overall this is a really cranky story with rather poor writing. throughout this show.

It does explain why Netflix picked it up, though. Unfortunately they have enough money to keep making garbage so I am sure we are bound to see lots more in the same vein.

They usually have the same clichéd story where the writers kill off every character one by one, but the main character conveniently survives. When I heard about this anime, I admit I was intrigued. Unfortunately, this anime did not meet my low expectations. I did not watch the whole show, so I\'ll limit my review to the first four episodes since these are the only ones I watched.The show has a good start. We see the gruesome devastation caused by the earthquake and give us a hint of what...to expect. And the animation is simple, not bad, but not very dynamic either, even though the landscapes and background are drawn with great detail. The problem is we don\'t see the emotional effect the devastation has on the characters. Sure, they show fear and sadness sometimes, but that tone is not maintained. The characters have some unrealistic bursts of optimism and happiness, emotions I don\'t imagine anyone having in the middle of a catastrophe. I\'ve never experienced an earthquake or a disaster of any kind, but I can\'t imagine a grown woman happily screaming ""let\'s take a selfie!"" after she sees a lot of people lose their loved ones and houses. I don\'t need to imagine it, because that\'s exactly what happens in this anime. And the unrealistic emotion of the characters does not stop there. In just four episodes the main cast see enough death and devastation to AT LEAST feel sorrow or cry a bit. But the emotional impact is nonexistent. A character dies at the very end of an episode, and in the next one, the first emotional reaction we see in the surviving characters is them fighting and yelling ""You are ugly!"" to each other? Really? The impact of the deaths in this anime is quickly washed away and forgotten, and the music does not help to make this atmosphere feel more devastating either.On a side note, each episode got weirder and weirder, introducing new characters (to be killed in the next episodes, I guess) and adding more bizarre moments and unrealistic characterization to the series. to expect.

As the show grows more bizarre as characters die at random, and are then forgotten about when a picture taking opportunity comes up, you can't help but laugh. Other moments, like engrish rap battles at the end of the world, or the boy's death (you'll know if you've seen it) just further build upon this. Japan Sinks 2020 is easily one of the best...unintentionally enjoyable comedies I've seen in a while. unintentionally enjoyable comedies I've seen in a while."", 'Masayuki Yuasa’s been a busy boy. He’s directed four anime projects within the last two years as well as running his animation studio Science Saru. It’s no wonder that he’s announced he’s stepping as president. The thing is though, when someone gets super busy with multiple projects, it’s not uncommon for the quality to slip with a least one of them. Japan Sinks 2020 is unfortunately that slip. In a time of disaster like 2020 has turned out, an anime about a family going through an actual disaster seems like it would make for good relatable drama, but it was really just a mess. It...has its moments but ultimately a mess.The show starts of great, each of the Mutou family (father, mother, daughter, son) going about their business only for a high magnitude earthquake to drop. Within a few seconds, their lives have been destroyed. The first two episodes set up the dire tone that the series seems to want to go for. It presents a clear domino effect of how the earthquake leads to even harsher disasters like toppling buildings that then crash into other structures and planes falling out of the sky. We see the ground littered with bodies, the media is giving no helpful solutions and survivors racked with fear over their loved ones. The family meet and with a few allies, they’re on their way to find salvation across the desolate country.The family are likeable even if they feel a bit generic and I like that their persistent strives for optimism surrounding as the despair of the situation. With disaster media, it’s common to see everyone descend into anarchy but dotting in light-hearted moments with the family helps give the narrative some brevity and a chance to get to know each member and their relationships better. It also makes the potential later dark scenes even more depressing; such is the case when characters eventually start to die. While I didn’t feel too bad for the individual victims, I loved the tension this created. Death is a constant presence in these episodes, it truly feels like any could be die, giving greater pressure to each new obstacle. As characters die, new one’s are introduced, changing the group dynamic and how the remaining survivors respond which in turn keeps the remaining characters and the audience on their toes. They weren’t the most complex bunch, but it was a great start and would make for an exciting yet tragic series if it continued this way.Warning: minor spoilersAll this potential dies when the anime gets to the ‘cult arc’. Around episode 5-6, the group stays with a religious cult that allows them to live in their commune for free with all resources provided. The shows basically become a quirky slice of life here. We get a fairly annoying new comic relief character; Daniel and the central characters don’t really develop. The writers probably wanted some down time to show the characters reflecting on their recent trauma but they just kinda goof off without really putting in deeper introspection beyond a quick crying scene.The cult themselves also don’t do anything interesting. When we first see them, they’re pretty suspicious, what with growing weed, putting it in everyone’s food and proclaiming a creepy stoic boy to be their messiah. You’d think that they’re being set up to have sinister ulterior motives, but the payoffs lead to nothing meaningful. There’s even a couple of fight scenes near the end that feel like they came straight out of a cheap Hollywood action comedy (that wheelchair scene). The entire arc feels clashes with the previously established temperament of the first few episodes. Bleak and realistic gets replaced with silly and over the top and it does more damage to the show then any earthquake could.The second half of the series attempts to return to the more serious tone (making the cult arc seem even more out of place) and for the most part it does get better but not enough to save it. The relationship between the mother and her children are a spark of hope, but the plot just meanders around without much to keep the viewer invested. The last episode, which is an extra 5 minutes long in particular felt dragged out. It supposed to be a kind of ‘what happened after’ epilogue, but I feel it could have been heavily condensed. As it is, it just came of as overly sappy fluff.For the characters, the family and their bonds are at the heart of this sinking ship. They may be a little stock, but they feel like a reasonably realistic family and you can relate to both the pain and joy they share with each other. Some of the best scenes here are just watching two of them talk about their hobbies. I especially enjoyed the mother and her attempts to be kind yet stern as necessary for the harsh road ahead. The daughter: Ayumu is also fine as the audience surrogate, being the emotional weight of team and most effected by the constant tragedy surrounding them. She has a simple yet effective arc of learning to become stronger and face adversity. In terms of the non-family characters; they’re hit or miss. A lot of them simply aren’t around long enough to be that interesting.I’ve left the son, Go for last because he ties in with one the attempted central themes of the anime. The show has a very pro multiculturalism and inclusivity theme. The family is bi-racial and Go in particular has a passion for other countries including dreaming of moving to Estonia where his gaming buddy lives. He constantly states that he hates Japan because of how horrible the people are and its’ vulnerability to natural destruction. He goes on and on about this and each time you just want to roll your eyes harder. By the end he is taught that Japan has good and bad aspects like anywhere else and that he should work towards making Japan better, which is true, but the message is obnoxiously ham-fisted.I get what the series is going for: Japan as a nation is metaphorically and figuratively fragile. It can easily be destroyed so clinging to rigid nationalist ideas of heritage and cultural purity will likewise be fragile so we should embrace new people from different cultures to build a better revived nation. A lot of internet peeps are calling the show “SJW propaganda” but this feel exaugurated. It’s a fine message that can be told well and will probably resonate more in a country like Japan where the debate between tradition and globalisation has been a hot topic for decades. But it’s just not done well here. It doesn’t really add anything to the overarching plot. As previously mentioned, the family is bi-racial and there’s one time the team meets some racist nationalists but those character just end up dying a few minutes later. These differing views are not really challenged or explored in a meaningful way, making them feel contrived, which in turn just makes the anime feel more padded as well as annoyingly preachy.The art is kinda jarring. Yuasa’s known for his highly imaginative colourful characters designs splashed with artistic style however Japan Sinks doesn’t have the same quality that say, Devilman or Tatami Galaxy did. The animation feels far cheaper, lacking the fluidity and sense of expression of his previous works. The character’s also frequently go off model during the more distressing scenes. This may well be intentional, yet it just looks awkward in addition to taking the emotion out of the scene. The character looks less like they’re grieving over their lost companions and more like they have constipation problems.Overall, I love Yuasa’s work, but this lacks to imagination and cohesiveness required to pull off a morbidly realistic disaster story. It has heart and it shows in certain moments with the love of the family but as the series continues that emotion gets lost in tonally confused subplots and badly exposited themes. It’s not terrible but it could have been far better if it just ironed out some of the issues, which arguably makes it even more of a mediocre disaster.PS: Apparently because Go is such as big westaboo, he speaks loads of annoying gratuitous English in the Japanese version, which sounds grating. I watched the dub, so I didn’t have this issue, but it does make me wonder; will this end up known the anime that’s better dubbed just because the sub’s characters are too annoying. Unlikely, but hilarious if it did. has its moments but ultimately a mess.The show starts of great, each of the Mutou family (father, mother, daughter, son) going about their business only for a high magnitude earthquake to drop.

They may be a little stock, but they feel like a reasonably realistic family and you can relate to both the pain and joy they share with each other. Some of the best scenes here are just watching two of them talk about their hobbies. I especially enjoyed the mother and her attempts to be kind yet stern as necessary for the harsh road ahead. The daughter: Ayumu is also fine as the audience surrogate, being the emotional weight of team and most effected by the constant tragedy surrounding them. She has a simple yet effective arc of learning to become stronger and face adversity. In terms of the non-family characters; they’re hit or miss. A lot of them simply aren’t around long enough to be that interesting.I’ve left the son, Go for last because he ties in with one the attempted central themes of the anime. The show has a very pro multiculturalism and inclusivity theme. The family is bi-racial and Go in particular has a passion for other countries including dreaming of moving to Estonia where his gaming buddy lives. He constantly states that he hates Japan because of how horrible the people are and its’ vulnerability to natural destruction. He goes on and on about this and each time you just want to roll your eyes harder. By the end he is taught that Japan has good and bad aspects like anywhere else and that he should work towards making Japan better, which is true, but the message is obnoxiously ham-fisted.I get what the series is going for: Japan as a nation is metaphorically and figuratively fragile. It can easily be destroyed so clinging to rigid nationalist ideas of heritage and cultural purity will likewise be fragile so we should embrace new people from different cultures to build a better revived nation. A lot of internet peeps are calling the show “SJW propaganda” but this feel exaugurated. It’s a fine message that can be told well and will probably resonate more in a country like Japan where the debate between tradition and globalisation has been a hot topic for decades. But it’s just not done well here. It doesn’t really add anything to the overarching plot. As previously mentioned, the family is bi-racial and there’s one time the team meets some racist nationalists but those character just end up dying a few minutes later. These differing views are not really challenged or explored in a meaningful way, making them feel contrived, which in turn just makes the anime feel more padded as well as annoyingly preachy.The art is kinda jarring. Yuasa’s known for his highly imaginative colourful characters designs splashed with artistic style however Japan Sinks doesn’t have the same quality that say, Devilman or Tatami Galaxy did. The animation feels far cheaper, lacking the fluidity and sense of expression of his previous works. The character’s also frequently go off model during the more distressing scenes. This may well be intentional, yet it just looks awkward in addition to taking the emotion out of the scene. The character looks less like they’re grieving over their lost companions and more like they have constipation problems.Overall, I love Yuasa’s work, but this lacks to imagination and cohesiveness required to pull off a morbidly realistic disaster story. It has heart and it shows in certain moments with the love of the family but as the series continues that emotion gets lost in tonally confused subplots and badly exposited themes. It’s not terrible but it could have been far better if it just ironed out some of the issues, which arguably makes it even more of a mediocre disaster.PS: Apparently because Go is such as big westaboo, he speaks loads of annoying gratuitous English in the Japanese version, which sounds grating. I watched the dub, so I didn’t have this issue, but it does make me wonder; will this end up known the anime that’s better dubbed just because the sub’s characters are too annoying. Unlikely, but hilarious if it did.', ""This is my first review of an anime since I started my account in 2012. I'm going to be honest with you, I only watched this anime start to end because I wanted to laugh at how bad it was with my girlfriend. This anime had so much potential. There were so many unnecessary scenes and the pacing was terrible. Honestly this is a 1/10 but the very ending kinda got me because it highlighted the beauty of Japan. There were times when I started to become invested however the art of some scenes (most scenes) would completely ruin it. I would never recommend this...anime to anyone. The rapping was kinda fire but not enough to save this anime. The only thing sinking was my will to go on. anime to anyone. The rapping was kinda fire but not enough to save this anime.

In Nihon Chinbotsu 2020, a catastrophe so large and devastating sweeps across Japan. There is no way to hide, there is only struggle or die. In this show we follow a cliche cast in a survival show, a family of four, accompanied by others along the way, each with their own personality. The family has a dad that knows how to do everything, a cheerful mom, a gloomy teenage older sister and a naive younger brother. This is a show about their struggles and meeting other people...along the way.As a disaster show, this anime does not shy away from depiction of death and destruction. Yet the moods between different episodes and often within the same episode can change from moments to moments. Its quick pace propels the show forward yet it may also be its downfall. By constantly introducing new moods and interrupting established tones, the show fails to allow the audience to become immersed in what the characters have recently gone through. It is hard to sympathize with the characters when there are not enough time spent on intrinsic struggles instead the show rushes you from one death to another.There is a very weirdly implemented setting in middle of the show. I understand that the new setting is meant to introduce a different mood and allow the characters to catch up with their feelings and provide the audience with momentary relief. However, when the characters arrive at this ""respite"", we the audience are confronted with a distracting plot point and the pay off at the end seems sub optimal. I acknowledge that this is a show that shows both the good in people as well as the evil thus its not afraid to try different things. However, the characters are often not developed enough and some seem even pointless.This is not the most realistic disaster show for the ""true main cast"" (the older sister and younger brother) always seem to be able the ex machina their way out of various situations. This shows wants to show the brutality of natural disaster and death of loved ones. We may pray for one character to survive but fate is just not so kind natured. However, with each death, the audience become more acclimated toward death and destruction, which is arguably the opposite of what this show intends. Yet it is the result because characters in this show often don\'t act like real people. Some characters may have developments that make them more believable but multiple elements and events of the show just make everything seem unbelievable.With all that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the show and at the end of the day I think that\'s all that matters. The characters do have their moments where the audience realize that maybe these characters are people after all. I enjoyed how the narration toward the end was interlaced with charming music and beautiful shots. The composition of the last few episodes are very strong and I really appreciated the direction this show ended with. If you are wondering if you should watch this show then my answer would be ""yes"". Come in with an open mind and just enjoy the message at the end, although it might not be the best show you\'ve ever seen, it is certainly worth it. Cheers. along the way.As a disaster show, this anime does not shy away from depiction of death and destruction.

Cheers.', '*Spoilers because it\'s impossible to review without talking about them since they shape the quality of the show*The first three episodes were amazing. 4-5 was pretty decent. The horror of watching your friends all die in 5 seconds after thinking ""it\'s just an aftershock"" and the fear of Ayumu/her desire to run away from the horrible scene was portrayed really well. I was also really emotional when the dad and Nanami died so suddenly, and the theme drives in a point that the little choices can be the determinant between a fine line of life and death and it can be robbed from you so...suddenly, or that luck of being in the right place at the right time can be the reason you\'re alive, from what we see how the family members each surviving. The first 2 major character deaths made sense, earthquakes can cause bombs to be exposed and gas to leak from the ground.The show does address the father\'s death and how weird grief can be, I liked seeing the grief catch up to the family around episode 6 when the mom and daughter grieved together. But...they did not address the grief for the other character deaths like Nanami and Gramps. It was shown for like 2 minutes then off to the next arc. Ayumi has horrible guilt for like 2 minutes then moves on. I wished her guilt came back later and the other characters help her work through it. I would be mentally fucked if I was in her situation and got a friend killed in 5 seconds and by such a small choice. But they really should have learned not to wander off from the group/main paths after dad got yeeted by a landmine from trespassing into a minefield, no?It went downhill after 6 though when people just dropped like flies for less sensical reasons. Then nosedived on episode 8-10. The plot stupidity reminds me of Mirai Nikki\'s poor writing. The boy getting hit by a fuckin rubble conveniently exactly where his head was even when there were no tremors? Daniel staying behind for no reason? The boat captain who was suddenly dead and eaten by seagulls? I got desensitized after so many obtuse reasonings for deaths. The problems that conveniently pop up so a character can say ""my time has come"". It felt like the Walking Dead game series where you can expect someone to die each episode and you can definitely expect only 1-3 characters of the 10 character cast will remain by the end...disappointing.Then the deaths felt more contrived. Oh the boat is tied up to the pier? Perfect opportunity for the mom to sacrifice herself. Oh the oxygen tank is conveniently damaged? Time for Onodera to die. Oh, it\'s a fakeout? Whew no one will die today. Nah, Haruo bites the dust. Great. My reactions to the deaths went from ""NOOOO NOT THEM"" to ""Oh fcking great, now this person is killed off. Whoooo next.""Then the kids literally do not reflect on her death not even like 10 minutes after. They literally revert to fun mode 5 minutes after any death.  And the rap battle after her mom freaking dying was so cringe. You kids lost BOTH parents. You MUST have something to say about that, no?? Spend the minutes on that reflection instead of the rap?? When you\'re on a ten episode time limit to get the plot across, spend every minute wisely... The dad died but the mom should at least have lived...jeez.maybe if they had more episodes to space out the lighthearted stuff and the heavy stuff, and sprinkle in some reflection on the deaths that happened, this series would\'ve been greater. (also at least one person dies each episode, the spacing REALLY would have helped)And Ayumu literally not dealing with her deep ankle gash? I can buy that she left it like that due to survivor\'s guilt or some form of selfharm/punishment. I could probably buy this plotpoint if she tried to keep it hidden from her family to not worry them, but it was out in full view like 50 million times, how is her family or anyone not pointing it out??While writing of how the characters handled death is shaky, I do give them credit for having an interesting cast and good character development for certain others. I didn\'t expect the family to be half filipino and half japanese. The shut in guy showing character growth from reserved loner to selfless, expressive hero was nice to see. I also liked Gramps and the way he went out no longer a xenophobe and returning Go\'s sign of good luck was so touching. The characters felt like normal people unlike the animes that crank the archetypal personalities to 10 (cough Clannad) so they are one note cardboard cutouts of tsundere, dandere, kuudere etc. Even though I hated the second half, there were still some 10/10 emotional moments and themes popping up from time to time. I still got some level of enjoyment from it. Gramps 360 no scoping guards on his whirly chair was so legendary.The art style was okay, but quality nosedived after episode 4-5. A lot of the faces looked wonky after that and way too wrinkly. Lots of faces not on model and lumpy in main shots even, not just background character shots where sometimes is excusable to look wonky. suddenly, or that luck of being in the right place at the right time can be the reason you\'re alive, from what we see how the family members each surviving.

There are several points where it works well, but there\'s also segments where it loses focus entirely. I wouldn\'t call it ""Good"" but it comes very close so it\'s worth checking out if you want to see characters persevere through a survival story and don\'t mind a few oddities.Full ReviewStory: 7/10 GoodIf you\'ve seen any of the disaster movies that came out of the 2000s craze, you know what to expect, but given the benefits of a longer runtime Japan Sinks is able to cut some...of the genre constraints. The extra length makes the journey more realized and gives the characters time to be developed. However, it\'s severely held back by a lack of cohesion. There\'s almost no sense of the passage of time through most of the 10 episodes and some of the developments in the plot make more sense than others, especially in minor instances when pseudoscience or the supernatural are the only explanation. Sometimes the landscape is so sparsely populated you\'d think there was a rapture, and sometimes new characters simply fall out of the sky. But the last third of the story is where it makes up for many of its faults and ties things together.Art: 5/10 Mediocre. There are several moments where the more realistic character animation really improves the effect of a scene, but there\'s very few where the art is particularly impressive. Most disaster movies rely at least to some extent on ""wow"" shots with collapsing buildings or the beautiful and scary power of nature, but there\'s little emphasis on that here.Sound: 6/10 Fair. The soundtrack is rather simple and it never really seemed like it was particularly elevating a scene, but it did fit the overall tone of a family\'s struggle to survive. Sound effects did their job just fine.Character: 7/10 Good. There are several aspects of the characters that fall short, especially their complete lack of emotion through several segments of the show, but the times when the characters actually do confront their emotions and one another are well done. Due to the reputation of disaster movies, it\'s hard to grow attached to characters sometimes but Japan Sinks did okay with that constraint. Overall, there\'s just enough good characters to make up for the mediocrity of the rest.Enjoyment 7/10 Good.Overall: 6.4/10 it\'s almost good.

And the story stays the same: Japan is in danger of sinking into the Pacific thanks to a ton of megalith sitting under the seabed. What this does to people, how they cope, what they try to do to survive, and what their parting or hopeful thoughts are for their disappearing country and for each other make up a huge portion of this disaster flick. Typical of Japan -- to imbue rich, inspiring human emotion into a situation with a fast-sinking island, and as they reach out to save...one another, it is from both certain death, as well as the heaviness of futility, regret, and helplessness threatening to pull them under, too.Much of the story takes place with Ayumu Mutoh as the focus, sometimes in the background, but often we hear her side of the tale. The gash in her leg, received from fleeing from the battered locker room in panic and fright, becomes a wound that she forces herself to bear. And throughout the series, she grits her teeth and refuses to treat it, perhaps as some form of repentance towards her trackmates for not helping them during the earthquake. Later, as her family and other warmhearted characters continually show their love in the form of diligence, optimism, nurture, and even sacrifice, they feed her inner strength as she chooses not to shrink in on herself and look forward to a brighter future for generations to come.Many of the key elements in the series are brought together by the impending disaster of a nation sinking underwater. It features viewpoints from various characters colored by skepticism, hopefulness, nostalgia, and curiosity about what the following days may bring as they march on to higher ground and safety. Often, however, is the relentlessly upbeat tone present throughout the series, harmoniously produced by the soundtrack as well as the main characters. Rather than trudging on with worry and anxiety for their safety constantly at their backs, they beat back the bad times and bring the good times at the forefront of their concerns, a lesson that should be well-learnt for all ages. The characters' good cheer in a time of danger, uncertainty, and fear for themselves truly reminds me of Palahniuk's Children's Crusade (more famously known as Slaughterhouse Five) as the oft-cheery aliens enlighten the human about how happiness in any world works: don't focus on bad times, because good times will make you happy.I applaud this series and Netflix for bringing about a miracle often lost in a sea of self-indulgence, social commentary, and all-around bad TV entertainment. There will be times when we will be overwhelmed, maybe even weighed down, by life-changing events that cause us to think back to better days and miss them to the point we don't want to look forward, but this series reminds us of what's important to each of us, and much like we carry our wounds and each other, how we find the strength and courage to pass the baton to the person waiting to receive it in the next lap. one another, it is from both certain death, as well as the heaviness of futility, regret, and helplessness threatening to pull them under, too.Much of the story takes place with Ayumu Mutoh as the focus, sometimes in the background, but often we hear her side of the tale.

What Netflix is doing is using the Japanese anime industry which has influence over the young public to execute their agenda, this thing is no anime, just a gruesome ideological propaganda. Watching this will be supporting their agenda and getting yourself nausea for a whole month. Stay safe, friend."", 'A thoroughly original and tasteful work with a philosophical leaning towards showing The Absurd in ways similar to Camus et al.Similar to other anime that are unique in its pacing and delivery and offer philosophical themes ingrained into the style and storytelling (e.g. Evangelion), there are many nay-sayers. People who enjoy mindless anime-s**t with moe or shonen fair that\'s done ad infinitum. People who don\'t like their comfort zone and status quo shaken and don\'t like coming out of their box. People who are so shackled to affection for likable characters they get mad if the very natural unexpected death of some to all...of them happens (people who disliked the red wedding etc).For those people, Japan Sinks isn\'t it.If it weren\'t for the oblivious other reviews on the site, this would have gotten a 9 in every department.

The pacing has its own will, but I personally had no problems or found any plot holes. Everything gets tied together neatly in the last episode and I got a lot of emotions and thoughts out of the whole series. And I give it an...8 out of 10! 8 out of 10!', 'Oh boy, what did I just watch? [ spoilers ahead ]I finally came around to watch Nihon Chinbotsu and I gotta say, it\'s one burning dumpsterfire. So much so that I just had to write my first review on MAL ever.Normally, I enjoy Anime with more realistic art and tone, but goddamn, that was far from it.Let\'s start with the art - I really dig the artstyle but the animation just isn\'t consistent at all. Some scenes are gorgeous and feel very fluent but most of them just look like inbetweens or like that one weird background character you spot that just looks deformed....That being said, the animation was probably the second best thing about this Anime. Gotta say though, I really liked the character design. A bit more down to earth than most shows.Next thing - the music. I was expecting a lot in this department, seeing that Kensuke Ushio worked on it. Well, the music itself wasn\'t bad - except for a few tracks that just felt like loops - but the placement of certain songs was just unfitting. Grim situations fell flat due to the upbeat music. And let\'s be real - that rap part was ultimate cringe.The characters. In my opinion, most of them didn\'t have enough characteristics to even be called a character. It\'s what almost made me quit the Anime. Ayumu was annoying until the very end, making unreasonable choices whenever she does anything, blaming everyone around her. And I know that a lot of people will say ""Oh, but she\'s 14, of course she needs to vent!"" right about now and, yes, I fully agree, but the poorly written - and badly timed - dialogue just didn\'t deliver those feelings. The only scene where I somehow found her to be an appealing character was when she was in that safety boat with Go. Other than that, the best character - Koichiro - died way too early, making all the other deaths in the show fall flat in comparison. Kite was quite okay as well, but let\'s be honest - he was OP, especially when you pair him with completely imcompetent morons. It would\'ve been far more enjoyable if everyone in the group had something to contribute. I mean, Go somewhat did, even though he was only 12. Go\'s constant English lines were getting on my nerves though, especially since the timing of the line contribution was even worse whenever a character spoke English. One of the worst character I\'ve ever witnessed in an Anime though was Daniel. What were they even thinking? Why put a slapstick comic relief that just felt unrealistic in a show like that? I wanted to bash in my screen every time he appeared.The story - oh boy, how could they mess it up so badly with such a great concept? I\'m not going to go into detail and pick apart every last bit - because I\'d have to rewatch the show to be able to do that, and trust me, I won\'t - but I\'m going to highlight the parts that annoyed me the most.The Anime was supossed to feel a bit more realistic and dramatic, but it all fell flat and was comedic at times where it shoudn\'t have been. Most of the times, I found myself laughing due to the obvious build up of a main characters death, ridiculous death scenes ( I\'m looking at you, weird-weed-cult-kid! ) and overall bad timing.The beginning was mostly fine, really, but as soon as they started killing off the characters, it became stale. I gotta give it to Koichiro though, his last words were great.Some of the scenes - like that almost-rape scene - made sense to be in there, but were poorly executed, which ultimately made them funny - which they really shouldn\'t be.The worst part by far though was that cult arc. It\'s where I first stopped watching for a few days due to how annoying Daniel was. How did anyone think this was a good idea? It felt like it belonged in another Anime, was scrapped there, and therefore was put in Nihon Chinbotsu, as they\'ve already animated it and didn\'t want to scrap it. It really didn\'t fit the intended tone of the Anime.Also, what\'s up with these ships? 1000 people chosen by lottery and kids with a promising future? Seriously? When there could be another earthquake any second? Y\'all really wanna check passports and ID\'s in a situation like that and not just try to save as many people as quickly as possible?The last few minutes just felt like a filler, obviously put there to make you cry - but that\'s only possible if you were able to feel any connection to the characters at all. I\'m somewhat annoyed by the fact that they have put Kite in the audience and haven\'t made it somewhat clearer that he\'s still alive, as a reunion between the main characters would\'ve felt nice and more rewarding - especially if he\'s so close by. It just felt like they were teasing.All in all, if they would\'ve made this into a movie and would\'ve gotten rid of half the plot and could\'ve distributed the money better for the animation, it might\'ve been decent.

That, unfortunately, just leaves us with a mediocre feeling on a show that seems like it really tried to keep it\'s audience in an uncomfortable position.Story: Japan Sinks 2020 takes place in Japan, where the Mutou family are going about their daily lives as if nothing can go wrong.  That is, until a gigantic earthquake completely devastates the city that they live in.  We see this happen as citizens get crushed by buildings and they\'re really not shy to show this.  Japanese authorities attempt to get everyone on...boats, but with the earth\'s crust beneath the island-nation completely tearing itself apart, not even the seas are safe.  The Mutou family are joined by multiple allies along the way with a single goal in mind: survive.One thing that this series does really well is show us how much you really need those around you when things get in tough, especially for the family\'s two kids, Ayumu and Gou.  Having the mental capacity to witness everything that goes on takes a beating on you, especially when this is all happening due to an act of God.  It\'s not like we\'re experiencing a crime such as a shooting or murder.  I actually think that the story elements surrounding those that feel connected to the Mutou family were done well, even if the show didn\'t always do right by it\'s characters - which I\'ll touch on soon.  Even though this series is only ten episodes, it does a decent job at taking us from place, to place, to place, while our cast attempts to do everything they can do to live.  This show wants you to feel uncomfortable at most times until the very end.For all the praise I\'m giving it, this show does have a few story elements that I didn\'t appreciate nearly as much.  The first, and most obviously for anyone who has seen other shows like this before, is that it gets very predictable at obvious moments.  Anyone who has seen movies, even in Hollywood, that touch on natural disasters will know where I\'m coming from here.  It\'s no secret that this show displays death at multiple moments, but when it does, it really doesn\'t feel like the show cares much about the characters that we tried to connect to.  They kind of just... do away with them.  There\'s the odd character I felt like they left off with us okay, but many just feel like throw aways.Another story element I didn\'t really like was it left the fate of certain characters up to us.  We see multiple characters who are connected to the Mutou family along the way, and we\'re not really left with any idea of what they ended up doing.  Are we to assume they all don\'t make it out alive?  The ending touches on a few of them, and even though I really liked that they gave the conclusion and wrap-up a very respectable time allotment, I feel like I wanted to know about some characters that weren\'t touched on.  The writing for some characters simply felt rushed or completely absent.  (6/10)Characters: Outside of the rough writing that I mentioned just now, the characters are mostly fine, with a few feeling a little too shallow.  Many characters are basically given one trait that they excel in, and that\'s about all the story does to showcase them.  For example, Harou, who we meet early on, used to run track & field... and that\'s really the only selling point we had for him.  There\'s just too little depth to, not just him, but multiple characters.  Ayumu and Gou are pretty annoying in the early going here, but shape out to be really solid by the time we hit roughly the forth episode.  Their parents are extremely optimistic and that\'s a nice mix considering the setting.  Kite, a famous YouTuber, meets up with our group a few episodes in, and it feels like they only get to certain parts of the story with him, carrying the story along.  He was probably the best character in the show.Many side characters run into the issues I\'ve outlined above.  Saburo was an interesting side character because of the bond that he created with Gou, but Kunio, Kanae, Osamu and Daniel all left much more to be desired.  Daniel, specifically, feels like he was only included for comedic relief, something I don\'t believe really hit at all.  His exclusion in the show, literally, would have changed nothing.  There are some characters included for short periods that you go ""yes, they are definitely just there to be friendly citizens"", and those are good characters to have, but this show really wastes a lot of it\'s side characters with shallow writing, even though I really enjoyed our main cast. (6/10)Art: Japan Sinks 2020 really is not a good looking anime, done by Science SARU.  They have a certain style on their shows that I just can\'t latch myself onto.  They use soft colours with very soft outlines for anything not related to nature.  Their characters often look really weird because they don\'t hold proportions either.  Close up shots are definitely passable, and the way it portrays the world whenever another earthquake occurs look decent, but anything else doesn\'t feel like it had the same level of care - especially with colour depth.  (4/10)Sound: This series didn\'t have much to it in terms of the musical compositions.  The OST, opening and endings were mostly forgettable.  However, the voice cast were really impressive.  You have some big names who never fail such as Bill Kametz (Harou) and Keith Silverstein (Mr. Mutou), but this might be the most impressed I\'ve ever been with Faye Mata (Ayumu).  She puts so much pure emotion into her role, something that I felt was very prevalent with someone like Stephanie Sheh when she was in every other series out there.  One I didn\'t expect to blow me away was Aleks Le (Kite), who, funny enough, I literally reviewed on in a series he was in the other day, saying he\'s always been kind of subpar.  Both him and Grace Lynn Kung (Mrs. Muto) were the best on a very impressive cast of actors. (8/10)Overall Enjoyment: Japan Sinks 2020 did a lot of things really well, and a lot of things that I didn\'t love at all.  It sort of evens out, but the biggest problem for me was the repetitive and predictable nature of the show.  If you haven\'t seen this kind of series before, you could do worse than Japan Sinks 2020.  But will it blow you away?  Not likely.

(6/10)', ""5/10Japan Sinks 2020 was one of my most anticipated anime shows to come out this summer mainly because it has Masaaki Yuasa's name attached to it. For those of you who don't know, Yuasa is in my humble opinion one of the most unique anime directors of our time and whose credits include Ping Pong The Animation (which I consider to be the greatest sports anime ever made), Keep Your Hands off Eizouken, Devilman Crybaby, The Tatami Galaxy and its spin off film, The Night is Short, Walk on Girl. His style is very distinct and far different from what you would get from a...standard anime.Even if some of his shows might not be that great, you can at the very least expect something that is probably better than most other anime shows out there. And when I heard that this was going to be his next anime project, my hype was through the roofs. I couldn't wait to watch it especially considering how dry the past anime season was due to countless shows being delayed thanks to COVID-19. And having finally watched the show on Netflix, I have to say that I am quite...... disappointed.I would argue that Japan Sinks 2020 is the worst show that Yuasa has ever done if in fact that he was solely responsible for the show but that would not entirely be the case as eventhough it is advertised as a Masaaki Yuasa show, he was actually not the only director who was working on this project. You see it was only after I finished the series did I find out that the show was also directed by Pyeon-Gang Ho who up untill this point only worked either on storyboards or as an episodic director while also working under Yuasa on The Night Short, Walk on Girl, Ping Pong The Animation and Devilman Crybaby.And from what I can gather, Japan Sinks 2020 was probably her first time working as a series director. So in reality, Pyeon-Gang Ho was the actual director of the show and Yuasa was just there to help her long the way as a mentor perhaps. And if that was the case, then that would surely explain a lot of the show's shortcomings. It might look like a Yuasa show but it lacks almost all of the fundamentals that makes his works so appealing.Let me get the positives out of the way first which in the show's case is the music composed by Kensuke Ushio who is another frequent collaborator of Yuasa's and whose works includes Ping Pong The Animation, Devilman Crybaby, Space Dandy, Liz and the Blue Bird and A Silent Voice. And there were several musical cues in this show that reminded me of some of the tracks from A Silent Voice. The opening is a very soft and mellow song that provided a stark contrast from the chaotic nature of the show while also reminding us of the peaceful beauty that can sometimes be found in this story. The soundtrack for the show is essentially the best thing it has going for it. Nearly everything else though either ranges from meh to downright terrible.The characters for the most part are fine and I did get attached to a lot of them as the show progressed though some of the decisions that they make at times can be a bit mind boggling. Our main protagonist, Ayumu, is a bit of a brat and I have to admit she got on my nerves on countless occasions. I get that it was part of her arc but man she can be insufferable at times. There is also her little brother, Gou, who has this knack for sprouting out English whenever he gets the chance and everytime he did I just couldn't take it.In fact, I was so done with this kid's schtick that on episodes 3 I shifted to the dub just so that I didn't have to hear his god awful attempts at english. Unfortunately for me the dub for the show didn't fare that well either. Most of the performances were meh to say the least and worst of all Faye Mata's portrayal of Ayumu made some of the more unlikeable attributes of her character even more unbearable and so I got back into the sub by episode 5.Now as the show progressed I did hope that most of them would make it out okay; only for that hope to be immediately crushed usually by the end of an episode. Now this is also something that I will give this show credit for; it is unafraid to kill off characters. With a premise such as this, you can't chicken out on killing characters and I will applaud Japan Sinks 2020 for making me believe that any one of these characters can die at any moment. The down side to this is that at times some of the death sequences can range from being unnecessarily gratuitous to almost comical. Admittedly, I did laugh at some of these death scenes and that's probably not a good sign.The animation also feels very cheap and looked like it was in dire need of more polishing. There is the occasional background art and even some landscape shots that are quite impressive but as a whole the animation is very underwhelming and there were several moments that felt choppy.Now initially, my biggest concern for this show was the possibility that it might have fared better as a movie. I had a similar problem with another show sharing similar attributes as this one i.e Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. And much like the aforementioned series, I think this would have worked better as a film as it really did feel like they were trying to add more story elements to fit into 10 episodes. I mean there was even a subplot involving a cult that occupies about 2-3 episodes and while I did find it interesting, ultimately it just felt like more padding than anything else.With all that being said though, I was surprisingly satisfied by the way the show concluded. To me the ending to a series makes or breaks it and the conclusion to Japan Sinks 2020 did at the very least made the whole journey kind of worth it. As much as I ragged on the show, it does definitely improve by the final stretch of episodes as I was much more invested in these characters. Japan Sinks 2020 is not a great show. Hell, I even hesitate to call it a good one but it did leave me satisfied and even hopeful for things to come. And considering the state the world is in right now, a little hope isn't too much to ask for.But I don't think any ending can fully make up for everything that came before it, so I would recommend everyone to SKIP this anime and move on to better things. As for some alternative recommendations, I would advise you to check out the aforementioned Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. While it isn't a great show by any means, it is still a decent watch if you are looking for a series that deals with natural disasters and even make you shed a tear by the end. standard anime.Even if some of his shows might not be that great, you can at the very least expect something that is probably better than most other anime shows out there.

With a premise such as this, you can't chicken out on killing characters and I will applaud Japan Sinks 2020 for making me believe that any one of these characters can die at any moment. The down side to this is that at times some of the death sequences can range from being unnecessarily gratuitous to almost comical. Admittedly, I did laugh at some of these death scenes and that's probably not a good sign.The animation also feels very cheap and looked like it was in dire need of more polishing. There is the occasional background art and even some landscape shots that are quite impressive but as a whole the animation is very underwhelming and there were several moments that felt choppy.Now initially, my biggest concern for this show was the possibility that it might have fared better as a movie. I had a similar problem with another show sharing similar attributes as this one i.e Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. And much like the aforementioned series, I think this would have worked better as a film as it really did feel like they were trying to add more story elements to fit into 10 episodes. I mean there was even a subplot involving a cult that occupies about 2-3 episodes and while I did find it interesting, ultimately it just felt like more padding than anything else.With all that being said though, I was surprisingly satisfied by the way the show concluded. To me the ending to a series makes or breaks it and the conclusion to Japan Sinks 2020 did at the very least made the whole journey kind of worth it. As much as I ragged on the show, it does definitely improve by the final stretch of episodes as I was much more invested in these characters. Japan Sinks 2020 is not a great show. Hell, I even hesitate to call it a good one but it did leave me satisfied and even hopeful for things to come. And considering the state the world is in right now, a little hope isn't too much to ask for.But I don't think any ending can fully make up for everything that came before it, so I would recommend everyone to SKIP this anime and move on to better things. As for some alternative recommendations, I would advise you to check out the aforementioned Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. While it isn't a great show by any means, it is still a decent watch if you are looking for a series that deals with natural disasters and even make you shed a tear by the end."", 'The art style really put me off but I was dead set on watching this. I felt terrified watching the first couple of episodes because they seem real in a sense. A lot of the story was exaggerated, but no good story is told without a few hiccups. While most stories have strategic deaths in a specific times all the deaths seen were random. No character grieved over the dying ones, and I felt that this st po RY should have shown them grieving.I also noticed an ongoing theme where everytime someone wanted to go take a picture, a death was going to occur. Which...was cool to figure out but not so cool to know that someone is going to die. was cool to figure out but not so cool to know that someone is going to die.', ""Personally, I did not like the show but I think there were some quality parts of it. The first few episodes that introduced the concept were exciting but things then went downhill towards the middle. I'd say the last two episodes were fairly decent and the ending was satisfying enough. I also was not impressed with the English to say the least... Overall, the one part I really liked was the rap scene since it was the only thing that kept me from dropping this show because of its overly gory, mediocre story.Some Suggestions:I think the studio may want to think about finding better...voice acting for the English, or just keep it to a minimum since that was one of the bigger letdowns for me when it came to audio. I also think the theme song was plain as well.I thought the visuals were well done mostly, and I could see some of the similarities to Devilman Crybaby, yet some scenes did seem a bit wonky (Likely because of the complexity of many of the scenes and deaths)Now the question is, would I recommend this to others? Most likely no, though in conversation I would say the first few episodes were done well. There was too many unneccesary scenes and an over abundance of average to bad story to it. Ultimately I'd give it a 6/10. voice acting for the English, or just keep it to a minimum since that was one of the bigger letdowns for me when it came to audio.

I myself only just got introduced to his work. I didn\'t like Devilman Crybaby, I thought Kaiba was really confusing, I absolutely LOVE Ride Your Wave, and one of his more recent anime, Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken, turned out to be pretty amazing as well, but I haven\'t seen it yet. So when I heard that Yuasa was making an anime called Japan Sinks, based on the popular 1973 sci-fi novel by Sakyo Komatsu, I was psyched, because...the premise reminded me of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, one of my favorite anime of all time. Since the pandemic has kind of been screwing over the entire world, I thought it\'d be nice to check this out to see if it\'s any good. But then it came out and people began noticing things about it that were just...wrong, not just from a narrative standpoint, but a lot of the decisions the show seemed to make really detrimented its overall quality. Seeing as I already decided to watch it, I decided to give it a fair chance.Needless to say, they were absolutely right. I wouldn\'t call this the worst anime I\'ve seen, but I\'m not gonna lie, Japan Sinks 2020 is a hot mess. Yuasa, what the hell?!So at first, you think the premise is gonna be kind of cool, focusing on a family and some of their friends dealing with a massive earthquake that decimates everything around them, realizing that Japan is going to sink into the ocean, and doing all they can to help each other and survive. People love stories about people trying their best and dealing with bad situations, and considering that disaster shows/movies tend to overdramatize or exaggerate them to the point of not being accurate to real life, Japan Sinks 2020 promising a realistic drama seemed like a breath of fresh air, and people went into it with those expectations in mind. I know I did, having seen and loved Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 myself. Japan Sinks does start off that way at first, but after a couple episodes, it quickly turns into a complete mess with weird story decisions, bad animation, random irrelevant characters and subplots thrown in that don\'t fit or don\'t add anything to the narrative, badly executed themes, and is completely inconsistent in every way. And coming from Yuasa, who actually can write a good story when he wants to, you\'d think he\'d have known better!For one, the animation. Again, Yuasa is well known for being a great animator, with his works always displaying surrealist or fluid animation that really brings out the best in what he\'s working on. With simplistic character designs that stay away from the typical anime style, low shading, and realistic backgrounds, you\'d think this would be great. Hell, the opening is fantastically animated, opting for a slow moving, watercolor look to it that absolutely encapsulates the peaceful life the Mutous lived before everything went to shit, with the song being just as good. Sadly, the animation is just one of many, many problems that plague the show. Many times the characters look plain wonky, with body parts looking out of place or have weirdly angled faces. Or other times you\'ll get shots like this, where they look like they were drawn by back-alley artists who can\'t seem to get perspective down in any way whatsoever, resulting it hilariously bad anatomy. Character motion is oddly jerky and stiltied, and facial expressions always look more derpy and cross eyed, failing at conveying any kind of emotion whatsoever. In stark contrast, the backgrounds completely avoid such problems. All of the backgrounds are wonderfully drawn, from multicolored lights illuminating the forest around a shrine, to tumultuous waters during a stormy sea, , to collapsed buildings and landscapes that convey just how desolate Japan is after the earthquakes that hit it, from a visual standpoint, those stand out in the best ways. Sadly, because of the lackluster character animation, this makes the overall art direction in the show very inconsistent. Also, some of the character designs are flat out strange. Go, the little boy, has a big head of hair that makes him look like he has a big mud ball on his head, one that\'s too big for his head at that, and the thick eyebrows just don\'t work. Ayumu, our lead character, is said to be in middle school, but she looks like she could be in high school at the oldest.The music fares much better, all of it being either well performed or well sung, with the opening song being the best out of them all. But it\'s the usage of the music that doesn\'t work. It\'s no question that Kensuke Ushio is a great musician who makes great music. However, for some reason, the creators of this had the bright idea to place ill-fitting music in ill-fitting scenes, such as upbeat piano tunes during a disastrous earthquake, or a peppy beat when a character is brutally killed, or a sad, somber melody when cooking dinner. Great music won\'t work if you continually misuse it, and again, Ushio\'s work is scattered all over the place and used inappropriately. It really says something when the English Digimon soundtrack, as flawed as it is, manages to make better use of its music than this does, and considering many people hate the Digimon dub\'s soundtrack for a variety of reasons, that\'s saying a lot!Speaking of somber and ill-fitting, the show seems to think that if it shoves in as many mature elements, kills people off every episode, and becomes darker and darker as it goes on, that that will make the show good. This is not the case. As shows such as Magical Girl Site, Cross Ange, and Afro Samurai can attest, continual drama, angst, darkness, violence, and mature subject matter do not automatically make something good. Again, it all comes down to execution, and frankly, Japan Sinks fails at making use of its themes, setting, and pretty much everything else. The absolute nadir of this is the random cult arc that takes up episodes 4-6, where the characters take shelter at a camp that turns out to be a cult that worships a woman who can supposedly speak to the dead. I know that in some circumstances, people tend to fall back on religion when disasters happen, but the whole cut thing just felt tacked on and pointless, along with various other scenes within it, such as a random sex scene between the cult leader and her husband (Though, to the show\'s very little credit, the sex scene is MUCH more tasteful than anything in Devilman Crybaby), various cultists trying to shoot said cult leader and steal her gold for no clear dumbass reason, the cult leader\'s child being mute, and so on. Basically, the whole arc doesn\'t do anything to further the story other than introduce the scientist who would later join them, and the writers could have easily written a much more organic, sensible reason for having him join them. It\'s just overall pointless and needlessly padded out. You could cut the whole arc out and nothing to be lost. Also, what the hell was the point of having TWO scenes were some creep attempts to rape two of the female characters?! It\'d be one thing if those scenes actually furthered the narrative, but they don\'t, and throwing in random rapists in an attempt to cause conflict is just tasteless because they\'re just there to be creeps and nothing else, so they\'re totally vapid and one-note, serving no purpose other than trying to force drama when there doesn\'t need to be any.And speaking of vapid and one-note, the characters. All of them are pretty much stereotypes with little to no real personality to them other than being eccentric in some way, and many of them get killed off without even so much as a real character arc. Not only that, their characterization is wildly inconsistent at times. Take for example Ayumu, the main girl. At one point, she disses some guy\'s footage of Okinawa sinking as fake news with no basis, and later on, she suddenly soapboxes about how stealing is wrong. The biggest offender is the old man with the drug problem, who isn\'t even named in the show (He\'s called Kunio in the credits, but if the show itself doesn\'t care to give him a name, why should we?) who wildly flips between being violent to caring to drug-addled to crazy, often within the same scene. Hell, Kite, the white haired YouTuber, isn\'t really so much a character as he is a plot device whose sole purpose is to replace the dad and make things more convenient for the characters. He\'s somehow this super awesome dude who can get anything done, and everything he does is conveniently beneficial to the characters, from flying on balloons to somehow acquiring a SEAFARING MILITARY TANK OUT OF FREAKING NOWHERE. Plus, any development the characters do get isn\'t even on their own, but due to some outside source. Haruo, the shut-in who doesn\'t talk much, and arguably the best character in this series IMHO, gradually talks more and becomes more proactive, but is it because he willingly decides to come out of his shell and help people rather than wallow in his own issues and problems? Nope! It\'s all because he got hooked on weed! So the development he winds up getting doesn\'t feel earned and is just the result of the writers having someone else force him to become more assertive because they couldn\'t be bothered to, y\'know, write him more naturally. Furthermore, several one-off characters, such as xenophobic racists, are only thrown in there just to be a one-off adversary the main cast can soapbox about being Japanese too without actually trying to write them being more subtle and three-dimensional. Oh, and all of the issues the show tries to tackle, such as national identity, racism, xenophobia, and drugs, are all written with as much subtlety as an elephant in a china shop or a nihilistic 14-year-old emo kid thinking cramming mature subjects in will automatically make something good. Uh, no. That\'s not how this stuff works! Yuasa, you should know this by now!Building off of this, I\'m going to paraphrase something a fellow reviewer said about the show and why its characters and characterizations are so haphazard: Lots of anime have characters that are little more than archetypes, but here\'s the thing: When you promote your show as being something, such as a realistic character drama, you\'re giving your audience expectations for that show and its characters. Nobody goes into shows like Princess Re:Connect or Love Live to have realistic, grounded characterization for its cast, because those shows rely on a certain gimmick, like moe cuteness or idols. But when you bill your series as a realistic character drama, the viewers are going to expect that, so Japan Sinks throwing in all of these random archetypes, stupid subplots that either detract from the narrative or don\'t go anywhere, and ridiculously overblown darkness and melodrama goes against the expectations the audience has for it, which further begs the question of why the writers even decided to go this direction in the first place. Seriously, if you want a disaster anime that\'s actually a realistic character drama and doesn\'t get off on trying to be as dark and shove in as many ""mature"" elements as possible, just go watch Tokyo Magnitude 8.0! It may be years since I saw that show, but I can guarantee you that it has much better writing, characters, and themes than Japan Sinks could hope to achieve, and it didn\'t try to be something that it wasn\'t!Which begs the main question: What the hell, Yuasa?! How could you go from writing awesome anime such as Ride Your Wave and Keep Your Hands off Eizouken to this?! You\'re good at writing well-rounded characters, stories, and know how to get a handle on your themes when you\'re not trying to go all out in your weirdness! You should know better! And considering this is his last TV project, as Yuasa announced that he was retiring as president of Science Saru, you\'d think he would want to end his animation career on a high note! Well, there is Inu-Oh coming up, so that could change. Now, the only reason I didn\'t rate this lower than 40 is because it didn\'t make me angry or offend me like other genuinely bad stuff I\'ve seen did, and it does have very, VERY few genuinely good things about it, so I\'m going to give it what little credit it does deserve. Japan Sinks honestly isn\'t the worst thing I\'ve seen/played/read (Those honors still go to Ijime, Elsie Dinsmore, and The Hate U Give), but it\'s just not worth it. Seriously.

If you can ignore the poor animation and drawing quality, maybe you can watch it entirely and you will find it quite enjoyable. If animation can put you off quite easily, you might drop this.Alright, I gave art a 2, dreadful. At times it was laughable. Considering it was a NETFLIX ORIGINAL, I thought it would have superb quality, but nope. Don't know if at times they employed rotoscoping, but if it was, I have seen better examples of it. This was quite poor. At times the proportions of hands, were way off. Like, REALLY off.Story wise, I give at and 8. It reminded...me of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 (no pun intended). But this takes the premise to another whole level. This show left me many times in total awe. It truly was shocking in plenty of moments... but there were some times when I was like, why the F did that happen? (i.e., something at the end of the first episode) only to be left without any explanation whatsoever.

The series tackled how people might cope with depression, sadness, fear and despair in the middle of a disaster or after it.The only reason I didn't give it a higher score despite all the shocking moments and the message delivered was the middle point of the series. At times I felt it dragged quite a bit. I started forward skipping many times and even after I forward skipped that much, I felt I didn't miss quite a bit after that mini arc was done.

The legendary anime filmmaker has a knack for ruining people with his stories. Japan sinks follows a family (father, mother, sister, brother) who try to survive when Japan literally starts to sink. It's a disaster movie with a difference as it focused more on the human element of what was going on.Apart from riveting stories, Yuasa also creates some compelling characters, we saw it in Devilman Crybaby, and Japan Sinks is no different. I hated the main character, Ayamu, as she was a pretty spoilt brat. On the other hand, her behavior was consistent with a teenager going through...a disaster. So while she severely got on my nerves, i respected how authentic she felt. The themes of family and sacrifice are strong in the show, and in the terrifying reality of a fallen Japan, familial bonds and sacrificing for people you care about really shone through. I hated watching this show, but i couldn't take my eyes off it.The animation was top notch as usual and Yuasa's visual style allowed him to so much with the show. As with all Yuasa shows, music played a huge role in this show and episode 9 in particular had a pretty sick freestyle session.This anime wrecks you, but if you're down for an emotional rollercoaster, then i can't recommend this show enough. a disaster.

The animation and art style can be a bit iffy at times, the story could stand to be more coherent, and I do feel like it is a bit too short. With that being said, why the 8/10?From the beginning, it is made clear that we will be following a nuclear family and their various acquaintances as they deal with and attempt to survive a massive disaster that, as is revealed later, sinks the entirety of Japan. While many would seem to have preferred a cast of nihilistic doomsayers, we had a cast of...optimistic family and friends that deeply cared for one another. This plot point is one that is very rare for an anime of this type, and I think that it is one that has the potential to make a lot of people very uncomfortable- the characters don’t feel real because people haven’t experienced what it is like to have a seemingly-totally happy family life. I would liken the way Japan Sinks 2020 handled its cast and progression to Clannad+After Story but opposite. Whereas in Clannad the family's life is relatable to so many people and jarring in a way that makes others feel sympathetic if they haven’t experienced it themselves, this anime’s family isn’t relatable to many because they were a perfectly happy nuclear family. However, there is immense value in portraying a family in this way; Japan Sinks 2020 defends the fact that we should all be entitled to and enjoy the love and bonds of family and understand the importance of sacrifice and duty. None of the characters are without emotion or likeability, and every character has some kind of flaw. If one can push past their feelings regarding the family being a nuclear family, then they can come to relate to the characters through their loss.**Skip Paragraph if Afraid of Minor Spoilers**Speaking of plot points, the entire story could have done with 2-5 more episodes in order to more fully flesh it out. There are various arcs in the story that stand out as a giant “why”. Why spend time exploring characters and plots that have no significance in the story when we could have explored the hardships of our main cast? The Cultist Arc is the biggest offender here, and in a world that is supposed to not only resemble but be a real-life Japan, why in the world are we brought to a city-plantation that can’t and wouldn’t exist in Japan? There is no way the Japanese government would allow a marijuana plantation to exist. The Cultist Arc just completely throws off the pacing and immersion of the show, and it feels like an artistic ham-fisted choice with no actual relevance to the plot or story.Finally, just a quick discussion on the animation. In many areas it is highly satisfying. The characters, by and large, look fantastic. The scenery is beautiful, and there was a ton of effort put into it. However, the consistency of the animation quality leaves a lot to be desired. At certain points the characters look like weird homunculi for no reason, and it completely removes the person watching from experiencing the story when the drop in quality occurs. That being said, I do think that there is something to be said for when the characters look ugly when they feel ugly- instead of taking me out of the story, the ugly looking characters paired with the ugly mood really drew me in and helped me relate to them. I was happy to see ugly crying in a medium that tries to make it look as elegant as possible.While this anime is certainly flawed, I do feel its story and animation are compelling enough to warrant giving it an 8/10.

The problem with this anime is that the plot is formulaic, basic, and you really don't miss much. Without it being a spoiler(cause you see it in the trailers), here's what you miss:Japan sinks.Brother and sister are protagonists who survive.Go from point A to point B and lose people on the way.In a nutshell, if you've seen Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, you've seen japan sinks 2020....And you're going to be salty that your favorite character didn't make it to the end. And you're going to be salty that your favorite character didn't make it to the end."", ""I just finished this show, and it took me a long while to complete it just due to how gruesome the show is at times, let alone other flaws. I want to be fair since I know many people either latch it as a high 8-10/10, or a 1-2/10. Honestly it's in the middle if you take in account everything from the story to the animation to the sound design.I will start with the positives. The sound design is very good. It replicates earthquake sounds well, and the music score is really good. Call it cliché, but I like a good orchestrated score and...piano music. The art direction is good. I think the color palate and scenery is really well done. It captured many areas of Japan that are recognizable by any casual viewer well.That said, I will go into the the more flaws. The first issue is the animation at times. This director is known for his unique style of animation, and one issue I get annoyed constantly is how he animates people's reactions.This is where I will begin my spoilers, but overall it's a mediocre show. The story and characters along with animation are my issues, and I will dig into spoilers now. Back to animation, at times they look great such as the final episode when Kaito's final moments of flying on the balloon in the final episode. Then other times when they showed the kids birth with their mom, and it looks like she is taking a crap while looking at her new baby. Let alone how everyone has neck fat to weird double chins when smiling. His idea of drawing muscles is bizarre at times. His shows have this style all the time, but in a realistic setting over something that is more fantasy driven like Devilman Crybaby which fits more than here. It just annoys me, and I think it's not good animation at times.The next big issue is the story, and how he insists on being as edgy as possible with killing people as gruesome as possible. I get how it's a disaster show, but at times the deaths are way over the top and gruesome. Also out of nowhere. The father dies by digging up a mine. First of all, no one when crossing that fence didn't see the signs until it was too late? Also the signs were covered in growth? A minefield? Come on, let alone in Japan. Maybe there is one, maybe not, but it's just not believable. Of course he blows up with bits falling on his family. It's just way over the top. Another scene is a fisherman's death, and you can tell he was dying due to how he was struggling from the impact and everything that happen. But the kids fall asleep, and they wake up with birds eating him with half of his body and bones sticking out? It's ridiculous, and uncalled for.Then it became cliché how every time emotional music started playing like there is hope, then someone will die. It became obvious you know someone was about to die. The only deaths that felt emotional and well done were the mother and Kaito, if he truly died. There are hints in the ending scenes he might have survived with offspring looking like him. I digress, but those were emotional. The others you know was coming like Haruo with the music and running. I get it how there weren't going to be many survivors, but it was way overdone in my view, and in many cases in grotesques ways.The characters are hit or miss. The main show is focusing on the two kids, the daughter and son. I think they were written fine, and had some good closure in the ending. More on that in a bit. But the father was an afterthought, then killed off quickly. Haruo didn't have much to it until the final 2 episodes. You could tell he was depressed, but not much explored until the end. The mother was actually decently written, but felt like we could have used more time with her. There are a good 2-3 episodes where it's just the kids. Finally, Kaito was interesting, but we needed more time with him as well. He always knew more than he let on until it was needed, but besides being a vlogger/online sensation, nothing else we knew about him. It's a shame he had a lot to him. Same with the professor.Overall it's a decent show. I think from the natural disaster standpoint and surviving is well done. The way they handled many characters and the over the top deaths is ridiculous. It honestly made it hard to finish the show since I expect deaths, but not people blowing up with pieces falling onto their kids to eye balls hanging out. When I see that gore, it's to be edgy over realistic. Let alone how it happens all the time.Honestly the show needed 24 episodes. More time to develop the characters, and more time to explain what is happening along with focusing on the broad survival of the people and what happen in Korea and the Philippines. The ending explored that briefly, and honestly the last 5 minutes are good showing what happen nearly a decade later. It's a satisfying ending, and the beginning is good. It's the middle part that is where it has a lot of issues from jumping from scene to scene like a convenience store to a cult to the sea.In my view I would have made it longer by focusing more on characters. Have less deaths, and make it less gruesome and edgy. Finally, explore more to why the islands sank. It was briefly explain as a convenient set piece, and nothing else. I hate shows that do that. Overall, give it a chance, but if you drop it, it's not a bad choice.P.S.: Olympics nitpicking. It ends in 2028 at the LA Olympics. Two things, they show the opening ceremonies in the LA Coliseum. The plans show a new stadium for the ceremonies and track and field. It's a given with the Olympics to host the biggest events in the newer stadiums, then used older sites for smaller events.

And everything from him before heightened said expectations. And when it all finished... MY standards weren't quite meet.There's greatness to be found in Japan Sinks 2020.

I saw the trailer and thought, ""yeah this seems cool. Can\'t wait to get my heart crushed."" I was wrong on the cool part, but my heart did get crushed a bit. We know what it\'s about. A giant earthquake hits Japan, and it starts sinking, so the main family is trying to escape with their lives. It was a neat concept, I thought it was cool that they were doing a new adaptation to this old book from the 60s, but I guess it...wasnt really meant to be.Story - 5I thought it started out really interesting, but then they got to that cult place and they didn\'t really do anything with it? It was a huge red herring, that essentially amounted to nothing. After that it kind of just started going downhill, not interestingly, kind of confusing, but I\'d just finished it because it was only 10 episodes, so why not.Art - 7I kind of liked the art, the animation a lot of the times felt realistic but it would get weird and off model sometimes. I think at the bare minimum, it fit the show.Sound - 6It was ok. It wasn\'t anything super amazing, I never even really noticed it most of the time until a character was about to die and then it started playing that really upbeat music with some lines on top of it, signaling that the character was probably going to die.Character - 3Probably the worst aspect of the entire series. I know that they were trying to be realistic with how grief and trauma affects you in a situation like this, but I dunno. It didn\'t feel like it was done well. Ayumu, the main girl, was really annoying for a most of the series, her personality kept flip flopping. Everyone felt pretty one dimensional, and Gou, even though he was pretty one dimensional too (since he\'s a kid), he was probably the most interesting. I still don\'t understand why Koga\'s personality completely shifted within the second half of the series.Enjoyment - 6I give it a 6 because despite most of it\'s flaws, it was still a pretty okay disaster series, and the poor writing didn\'t really turn me off enough to get me to stop watching Japan sinking and wait for the kids to get rescued.Overall - 5Yeah I dont have much to say on this. It\'s mediocre. Would I recommend it? I dunno.

Everyone felt pretty one dimensional, and Gou, even though he was pretty one dimensional too (since he\'s a kid), he was probably the most interesting. I still don\'t understand why Koga\'s personality completely shifted within the second half of the series.Enjoyment - 6I give it a 6 because despite most of it\'s flaws, it was still a pretty okay disaster series, and the poor writing didn\'t really turn me off enough to get me to stop watching Japan sinking and wait for the kids to get rescued.Overall - 5Yeah I dont have much to say on this. It\'s mediocre. Would I recommend it? I dunno. Sure I guess, it\'s only 10 episodes so you\'re not losing much.', '10 episodes, no novel or live action knowledge --- spoiler free!Art: 3In general, the backgrounds are pretty standard quality. My gripe with this is the character designs. At times, the animation of them were so overly simple that it just felt off. The aesthetic overall is okay. I was not expecting haute couture level outfits that characterize the scifi/fantasy anime genre or ufotable quality effects and details but character animations made me feel it was worse than the usual mediocre harem anime...and face it, it\'s not the background I spend the most time watching on the screen (which was decent), it\'s the characters.Sound: 5Standard. nothing...stood out. No earrapes. Guess that works.Character: 4This show isn\'t even a full length 12er. I don\'t expect much here, but the characters come off as bland at best and overly stupid at their worse (Ayumu\'s tantrum after one of the deaths literally pissed me off, and the random rapist truck driver\'s thoughtless behaviors and disregard for safety was another one). I can\'t say the deaths were impactful either for that reason. For the ones that died early on, we get a person and their personality trope. For the ones who survived, you get a rushed picture but literally not much else. There\'s no complex insight into their psyche that would be appropriate for 10 episodes.Story: 6This show is literally a ""what if this horrible thing happened"" scenario. I would not say there is much of a plot, as to say this 10 episodes were an imagination of a scenario that sends the cast off on an adventure westward in a modern post-apocalyptic setting. Kinda like Ash Ketchum wanting to be the Pokemon master and going on a journey because of it. The difference being this one ends somewhere whereas Ash is still 10 years old (somehow).And... that\'s the problem after the first episode. Immediately after the premise is introduced, we see attempt after attempt at drama by bringing forth over-the-top scenarios that in a real disaster are just not likely to happen. The worst part is when they run out of ideas of how to make dramatic aLIEz tier drama, they resort to absurd levels of stupidity as reason for characters to drop dead multiple times, at which point, as the audience, I could feel the makers\' dilemma of needing to fill up 10 episodes of time(never read the original novel so I can\'t say if its based on the events there and rushed, or creatively trying to fill screen time).Overall: 6My overalls ratings are rarely heavily influenced by art or sound. Sometimes, I even forgive character development issues. This show would have done much better as a 2-3 hour movie with a reworked plot that removed the stupidity and made a situation where the characters actually tried their hardest and smartest against a situation with no other way.Who\'s this for:-People looking for a tragedy they can heavily relate to for the time the show was released (those having issues due to covid)-People who enjoy shock value-Simple people who aren\'t looking for too much depth in their entertainment,Who\'s this not for:-Highly intelligent people who would have spotted the incompetence and stupidity of the cast-People looking for a realistic take on an attempt to survive the sinking of Japan. (Dead bodies raining from the sky  out of the blue won\'t please you because in no IRL *natural* disaster did this ever happen)-People who don\'t like needless, forced tragedy-People who find gore, disabling injuries, and amputation disturbing stood out.

The greatest part is that it all comes in the form of anime.Japan Sinks 2020 a consequential and heartwrenching series rooted in hard goodbyes and new beginnings.A fitting finale for Masaaki Yuasa’s retirement from Science Saru studio.The anime brings with it, a well developed plot with a lot of realism. With earthquakes and tsunamis changing the geographical landscape, gas lines in the city breaking up and exploding, poisonous gases coming from the ground like sulfur dioxide or carbon monoxide that can kill you instantly and more, not to mention the...destruction to buildings and even the possibility of a volcanic eruption if the tectonic earthquakes manage to trigger the pressured magma within the storage region.But enough of the geographical stuff and let’s move on to what truly makes this anime great. The depth of the characters. Its only fault would be that it could have been more developed instead of compressing the entire plot into ten 25 minute episodes.The anime was still extremely emotional, I almost teared right after the second episode. The emotions of the characters were so realistic and well-written. They each have their own way to deal with grief and find a reason to survive.What’s sad however, is that in reality, if something like this happens, anything can happen, that amount of realism was portrayed. One misstep or simply being at the wrong place or at the wrong time can kill you.To be frank, I watched this anime on Netflix out of pure curiosity but after a few episodes, I was hooked and can’t help but grit my teeth and get through it.There was also the incorporation of digital technology and social media which helped the characters get through the disasters and even aforementioned eSports in the Olympics which makes the anime a tad more relatable to societal norms. It was interesting to see how the disaster and emotional loss was depicted in a creative video game format in the minds of a child gamer.What really caught my attention at first though, was the beginning of the end.The initial moment of the disaster was terrifying yet it was so beautifully depicted, it happened all too quickly. One large tremor and in that one instant... complete silence. In that silence, we got to witness a beautiful sunset amidst the glorious aftermath accompanied by a melancholic but lovely soundtrack composed by Kensuke Ushio which really sets the tone for that scene very well.The beauty of it all is really the animation, the art and the soundtracks. The characters were what gave the anime so much depth and emotion. The anime really showed how fragile the human bodies were, the fragility is what comes with our reality. Humans aren’t flexible, we’re more likely to break than bend.The harshest reality of it all is that this pace actually makes sense to me. Although I said the anime doesn’t give much time for the characters to develop as much as they could have, the harsh reality is that the anime addresses how the characters barely have any time to process their grief and emotions, it’s one disaster after another while witnessing countless friends and family both new and old drop before them.The characters’ emotional responses come at a later portion of the anime which really hits like a rock and I mean that both literally and metaphorically. It’s tough to stomach but only fitting for a disaster anime. It’s really sad how the death and emotional toll of the main characters’ and their party just rises.The art style follows a more gentle and fragile depiction of the scenery with a detailed expression of the characters and their faces. Unlike the overly dramatic cliched works in some Western films, Japan Sinks follows a more gentle illustration with a melancholic melody to accompany it like how the earth opens up and just swallows everyone above so ‘gently’ and ‘finely’.Another thing worth mentioning was the number of selfless and compassionate individuals amongst a gravitating nihilistic societal norm. The hero of the anime and the others that selflessly sacrificed themselves some aren’t even close. They were mere strangers or passerby yet were still so willing to give up their own lives to save another... Regardless of race, language or religion.Speaking of religion, even amidst the nihilism that usually accompanies the end of the world, there was still religion and belief even though it was short lived.And the ending... it might seem anticlimactic but it’s perfect. That melancholic familiar soundtrack that played throughout the series and a beautiful narration by the main character of everything that happened and everything we’ve been through. Truly a disastrous masterpiece.Take note that this review may be outdated.

That said, I think the biggest issues I had with this show were the pacing, and some of the character beats. It's complicated though because for all the small problems, there were some 10/10 moments in this, and the kind that you get from watching a really sad movie that you know is good but you never want to watch again for how unbearably sad it made you. And something I felt I couldn't express in a mere rating number...of 7/10. of 7/10."", 'This anime left me perplexed.Yuasa is an acclaimed director, but the 9 first episodes oj Japan Sinks, if interpreted literally, are so absurd that I can only think about two options:1 - The director used a lot of facilitations because he was lazy.2 - He made it intentionally.The story has a lot of scenes that makes no sense: ridiculous deaths (sometimes they are comical), a lot of coincidences and script facilitations, also, the characters reactions to tragedy are bizarre.But I remembered that Yuasa many times prioritizes the anime\'s message, the theme, in place of coherence and sense. Maybe he has done something really bold...here. Maybe he has threw away coherence, sense and development of the characters for 9 episodes, lefting only the theme.What would make this genial is the fact that this anime\'s theme is precisely ""What is really important?"". The character are facing a catastrophe, and what is important in those moments?Also, the show debates what is the most important thing for a country\'s identity. Culture or territory? The individuals or the colective? Maybe both to both questions.So, in this anime, the only thing that would matter is the THEME, that episode 10 works really well. This episode was the only one I really enjoyed and it\'s called ""Rebirth"", refering to Japan\'s rebirth after catastrophe. Maybe this is where the viewer should have this realization. Maybe this refers to the symbolic rebirth of the anime?Anyway, probably I am just tripping and this is just a terrible anime with a good final episode.

After experiencing a really strong earthquake last 2013 in my hometown, I’ve become really scared of it. That even a very weak shake of the ground makes my heart pound so hard, and watching this anime reminds me so much of what happened last 2013.This anime has a low rating on MAL so I wasn’t really positive that I could get past the 1st episode, but look at me now, I finished it hahahaha. Well, let me tell you more about this anime on the following points below.AnimationThe animation and...character design of this anime is not that good. I don’t really like to say it like that, but that’s just how it is. I am not a big fan of the animation and some character designs make me cringe. I’m usually pretty lenient when it comes to this part, but I have to make this clear to you guys so that you will not expect more of it when you decide to watch this series.I may not have been a big fan of the animation and the character design but there were some parts where the landscape looks really good.StoryI always love a good story with my books and anime, and this one gave me an intense feeling as early as its first episode. And it also didn’t help that we’ve got to see a really heartwarming family story in this one, although it was more on the tragic side. So for those of you that aren’t a big fan of it, then this one may not be a good fit for you.I guess you could say that the main reason why I decided to finish this story was because I was pulled through by the story. I love seeing how each character pushed through life and continued (even though there were times that some of them almost gave up) and then eventually survived. I don’t want to spoil you but I don’t think I can finish this review without mentioning the part that really really left a big impression on me. That was on the part where their father died. Man, that was really unexpected and at such an early episode. Huhuhu.CharactersI don’t think there’s a character that I really hate in this anime, although in the early episodes I almost want to choke Ayumu, lol. It also comes as a surprise that the mother is a Filipino, that was really unexpected but definitely a good addition for me.Voice ActorsI only watched this anime on English dub so I can’t really say much on the sub. I don’t think I remember hating the VA while watching this anime though, I think it was because all of my attention was on that not-so-eye-catchy animation.Final WordsI think this anime, Japan Sinks: 2020 is a perfect representation on how a country and its people can get up even after experiencing such a tragic disaster. It brings hope to me, so I hope it will to you as well. character design of this anime is not that good. I don’t really like to say it like that, but that’s just how it is.

The thing is, I wouldn't want to watch it again.  It's something you watch once, survive through it, and never watch again.  That doesn't mean it's bad!  There is hope in the core of this anime's message.We follow a family that is trying to survive in the midst of Japan's deadliest natural disaster [totally fictional].  As you...might expect, not everyone is going to make it, and the deaths are treated as par for the course for such a devastating circumstance.There are times when it is inconceivable that certain characters survive, especially given the realism of other deaths, but I get that the story is trying to tell us something and so it's good to just go along with it.  Don't get too attached to any one character though because no one is really safe.The art is classic Yuasa so ugly it's beautiful at times, so beautiful it's transcendent at others. The score is made to wring emotion out of you, but it's also there to give you hope, it is almost telling you not to give up hope even when the story is giving you nothing but pain.The characters are the weakest point in this anime, but that doesn't mean they are bad.  The story is not here to give you fleshed out backstories and motivations.  Nevertherless, from what little they give you, you understand them and they do feel like individuals. I would have liked to get more characterization and to have a more personal human drama, but this is not that.  It is a fable, told for the purpose of delivering a message.That said, all in all this is a story about being proud of who you are without forgetting that we are all in this world together. It is a love letter to Japan but also a warning.  And taken as that, I really really liked it. might expect, not everyone is going to make it, and the deaths are treated as par for the course for such a devastating circumstance.There are times when it is inconceivable that certain characters survive, especially given the realism of other deaths, but I get that the story is trying to tell us something and so it's good to just go along with it.

And then everything went downhill from there.I never read the book this is based on but as the story went on I’m not quite sure what the writers were going for.The strange middle arc at the “temple” suddenly throwing supernatural elements into what was a disaster story didn’t make any sense. I can see what they were trying to do and the person who had scientific data on what was going on was somehow located there so it was necessary to visit that place but... everything else didn’t make sense. I thought...there was a Midsommar scenario going on the way it was progressing.Then this final arc of trying to get off land and onto a boat and then finally drifting at sea once separated from everyone wasn’t realistic. The situation was somewhat real but the reactions by the characters were not. Let’s just have a boat with your mom flip over and then you’re stuck on a raft but you have no reaction to that at all??? I would be crying that my mom died or something. She’s not dead yet but I don’t know that. At that point I was so disassociated from the characters due to their reactions (or lack thereof) that the rest of the series fell flat. I couldn’t take anything else seriously.One bonus was this random rap battle which was the only enjoyable thing in the last 3-4 episodes.But between random supernatural shrines, a girl that lets a cut on her leg go untreated for the entire series to the point of amputation, and a random secret underground cavern with some mysterious data that merely says Japan will rise again one day... I’m done.Watched the whole thing and the first 3 episodes hooked me. Unfortunately, nothing good came after that.The most unforgiving thing is the characters. The first 3 episodes had decent character development and then afterwards everything else just went unexplained.Lastly, half way through I thought the animation company switched with another. From episode 6 on it was like a completely different company. Proportions and facial expressions were all out of whack.This series could have been great but because of some serious flaws, pacing issues, and lack of character development this series is meh.

(some spoilers ahead) .The anime starts on a good note, as any apocalyptical anime/movie should start and the first 3 episodes, in general, are ok, but the main topic of the story gets lost after they join a cult, a famous YouTuber (?) enters the story, the kid that follows the family for no-reason (no background) never talks until the last scenes, the end up doing pot in some random place that for some strange reason has yet to be hit by the earthquakes?** (not sure how is this even possible), and some kid that speaks...to the dead??** (I am not sure how is this even relevant to an apocalyptical anime, but ok), a hardcore-addict grampa(?) and an Eglish dude who wants to die with the cult (?).. and there was so many out of place and 'what the fu*k' moments that should not have happened.It was a good laugh, the main concept is good (that's why I gave it an 8) but if you want to get feels and get attached to the story and be one with the characters and the plot, this is not that kind of anime.The anime gets lost because the creators try to mesh many plots/issues such as drugs, Japan's nationalisms/anti-nationalism and issues regarding cults/religion/harassment etc. Unless it was intended that way, and the 'sinkin' is just a symbolism of how Japan is going down with all these problems... but you be the judge. to the dead??** (I am not sure how is this even relevant to an apocalyptical anime, but ok), a hardcore-addict grampa(?) and an Eglish dude who wants to die with the cult (?).. and there was so many out of place and 'what the fu*k' moments that should not have happened.It was a good laugh, the main concept is good (that's why I gave it an 8) but if you want to get feels and get attached to the story and be one with the characters and the plot, this is not that kind of anime.The anime gets lost because the creators try to mesh many plots/issues such as drugs, Japan's nationalisms/anti-nationalism and issues regarding cults/religion/harassment etc. Unless it was intended that way, and the 'sinkin' is just a symbolism of how Japan is going down with all these problems... but you be the judge."", 'I have praised Yuasa a fair bit in the past, as I have pretty much enjoyed (if not absolutely loved) all of his previous works, however this one is a hard pill to swallow.I\'m not going to give separate scores to anything, nor will I spoil anything, I will just try to convey what I thought and felt about it.One phrase that could perfectly summarize this anime is: ""hard to watch"".The story is rough, which was expected, but at some points I felt like it was too rough and for no reason at all. Every episode has you on edge about what terrible thing will...happen next, which could be a good thing for some series! but if they were going to do that, they should\'ve given us a way better release (ending), which they didn\'t. Some bits of the story, and even complete episodes feel like they were there just to fill the needed time to get to 10 episodes to complete this garbage. Someone could argue that Yuasa wanted us to feel the same the characters felt, but I would say that\'s just a poor excuse, and not just that, it makes the anime harder to watch, and pretty much unenjoyable.Yuasa keeps shoehorning english in his series for no reason at all, and it\'s (again) hard to watch. Everytime I heard ""Go"" say his 2-3 english words whenever he opened his mouth I physically cringed, and this was a pretty often occurence in all the episodes. The art quality dropped so hard at some points that I couldn\'t help but think that they made this anime just because they needed the extra money while they were working on Eizouken.The sound design and music were fine, nothing amazing like other Yuasa works.Overall I give this a 6. It was like a trainwreck, I certainly couldn\'t stop watching; it isn\'t complete garbage, it has moments of brililance, but I felt like I wasted my time so much that I felt the need to come write a review at 4am after having finished it, and ultimately, this does not live up to the calibre of Yuasa. Disappointing. happen next, which could be a good thing for some series! but if they were going to do that, they should\'ve given us a way better release (ending), which they didn\'t.

Someone could argue that Yuasa wanted us to feel the same the characters felt, but I would say that\'s just a poor excuse, and not just that, it makes the anime harder to watch, and pretty much unenjoyable.Yuasa keeps shoehorning english in his series for no reason at all, and it\'s (again) hard to watch. Everytime I heard ""Go"" say his 2-3 english words whenever he opened his mouth I physically cringed, and this was a pretty often occurence in all the episodes. The art quality dropped so hard at some points that I couldn\'t help but think that they made this anime just because they needed the extra money while they were working on Eizouken.The sound design and music were fine, nothing amazing like other Yuasa works.Overall I give this a 6. It was like a trainwreck, I certainly couldn\'t stop watching; it isn\'t complete garbage, it has moments of brililance, but I felt like I wasted my time so much that I felt the need to come write a review at 4am after having finished it, and ultimately, this does not live up to the calibre of Yuasa. Disappointing.', 'There are many reviews already explaining the situation very well and probably in better written words than this, but I\'ll still weigh in.First and foremost, the most critical flaw of this anime is that it is taking itself too seriously, even though it is very committed to making crucial artistic mistakes or bad storytelling decisions. In an apocalyptic setting of merely 10 episodes, there\'s no real focus on the decision/consequence mechanics of a survival-oriented story, instead we are continuously presented by a loose string of side events that take about a third or the fourth of the series\' length each, which do not contribute to...the characters\' stories or the overall events at all. Most of these event chains are also pushed into the spotlight in the dreadful deus-ex-machina because it is obviously convenient for the writers to just make things happen in the most absurdly convenient way for the characters. Many pop culture references of the ""high taste"" are also introduced, with many weak jabs at virtue signals, which I would be very well accepting of if not executed badly, but such stuff is really wasted on a ""work of art"" that is not nearly as rich as the references it is making. Such things could be exemplified by the ethical dilemmas introduced in the ""cult"" section (not spoiling it further), and the ""rave"" scene - in which we have a Northern European person very well acquainted with their own club scene - also very well acquainted with the Japanese underground (who would really blast Hiroshi Yoshimura\'s Green in a rave anyway? That is kind of creative, but not in a sense that makes the anime creative regardless). The virtue signals? Well, they are introduced in the blandest way possible, in the form of ""combating nationalism and fascism"". I don\'t like such ideologies myself as well, but I don\'t see how it is relevant to the plot if it only appears in 2-3 minutes of our characters going ""You suck! Hope you don\'t survive"", and then just not having any conflicts or any sensible dialogue about such events at any point again in the story. Most of the time such scenes are also decorated with the deus-ex-machina, as an alternative resolution to their conflict is almost ever present.Moving on to the characters. If the average shounen protagonist was really disturbingly uncanny to you and you wanted some *realism* out of this anime series, you will be shocked at how oblivious and jaded this anime\'s understanding of actual human realism can get even more uncanny than that. It\'s really painful to watch so many ""regular"" human beings act in so ridiculously unnatural ways. The creators apparently spent so many painstaking hours on making this Eastern European person with the war-affected past to just make him, in quite the dictionary level literal sense, only clown around and say ""cheer up"" to our characters because it was *yet another* deus-ex-machina moment, this time to cheer Mari up because she had to be the rational mother character of the bunch (she is equally badly written, however). He is also thrown into a few virtue signalling sections because he is an ""outsider"". I don\'t even remember how he then disappeared, he is *that* irrelevant to the plot. In general, most of the characters (except for like two or three of them) are, despite the apocalpytic conditions around them, acting as if they are completely unaware of the looming threat of death around them and proceed to be even *less* careful than an average human being as they ever can - so that the story can get some cheap conflicts to move the story forward. The sense of moral values are ridiculously twisted: most of the horribly written characters in the motley crew of our story tend to be self-destructive in any case beneficial or detrimental to themselves or others. It is alright to support such ideas, and to have characters that follow such ideas - but it gets awkward when there is a god mechanism (I am tired of saying deus-ex-machina) hovering above them and rescuing them from almost all of their consequential conflicts. We are only presented with the idea of consequence as a mechanism to reduce the amount of writing that this story requires to move forward. Nothing more, nothing less.Overall, this has been a very cheap experience, with blatant artistic corner cuttings and mistakes even though it is advertised as an anime of the artistic and moral high ground, maybe even close to the apex. It gets that pretentious, and it is tragicomic to observe such a situation. I will not be able to listen to Hiroshi Yoshimura with the same amount of joy ever again.3/10 the characters\' stories or the overall events at all.

I would like to make this review taking advantage of the fact that I ended up just now, minutes before writing this review.Beginning, some deaths happen in this anime and I already expected considering - that - I can\'t say why but if it were to say a reason it was because the studio was connected with devilman crybaby, some of these deaths I even understand the...""weight"" that brought for the story in general, but most I thought it would be unnecessary and unnecessary, it didn’t bring emotional load and didn’t make much difference for those who were watching because it was already repetitive, predictable and that would only make a difference if you liked the character, but even so. .. anyway i would like to rate this anime 3 - 4, BUT IT HAS HAPPENED SOMETHING I DIDN\'T EXPECT SO MUCH, its FINAL is very beautiful, really ... it compensates almost everything else that probably displeased you until you reached it, being sincere, the ending is very beautiful, exciting, you feel the weight of the feeling that the people, both Japanese and non-Japanese, could be feeling with all the tragedy and what happens next to it with those who survived resurging. Because of this end my grade will end up being 5 - almost 6, haha.A simple opinion, the anime would be much more beautiful if it were a little more cliché and I think it wouldn\'t hurt anyone, it could simply be an anime of survival in natural disasters, with some scenes that in the anime something bad happened and you already predicted the cliche of possible death that the anime already left you wondering ""hmm, but one that will die, sure"", it could have his cliche doing well in the end, it would have the same emotional weight in the end and he would still be beautiful because it was very beautiful anyway done, there would only be a few more characters haha.Primeiramente bom dia, boa tarde ou boa noite pra quem está lendo esse review, vou postar ele como voces podem ver em portugues e usarei o google tradutor para traduzir pro ingles. Gostaria de fazer esse review aproveitando que eu acabei agorinha, a minutos antes de estar escrevendo esse review.Começando, algumas mortes acontecem nesse anime e eu já esperava considerando - que - não sei dizer o porque mas se fosse para dizer um motivo era por causa do estudio estar ligado com devilman crybaby, alguma dessas mortes eu até entendo o ""peso"" que trouxe pra história no geral, porém a maioria eu achei desnessaria e sem necessidade, não trouxeram carga emocional e nem fizeram muita diferença pra quem tava assistindo porque ja era repetitivo, previsivel e que só iria fazer diferença se você gostasse do personagem, mas mesmo assim... enfim eu gostaria de dar nota 3 - 4 pra esse anime, MAS ACONTECEU ALGO QUE EU NÃO ESPERAVA TANTO, o FINAL dele é muito bonito, de verdade... compensa quase todo o restante que provavelmente te desagradou até chegar nele, sendo sincero, o final é muito lindo, emocionante, tu sente o peso do sentimento que o povo tanto japônes quanto não japones poderia estar sentindo com toda a tragédia e o que acontece depois a ela com quem sobreviveu resurgindo. Por conta desse final minha nota vai acabar sendo 5 - quase 6, haha.Uma simples opinião, o anime seria bem mais bonito se fosse um pouco mais cliche e acho que nao doeria em ninguém, poderia ser simplesmente um anime de sobrevivencia em desastres naturais, com algumas cenas que no anime aconteceu alguma coisa de ruim e tu já previa o cliche da possivel morte que o anime já te deixava imaginando ""hmm, mas um que vai morrer, certeza"", podia ter o cliche dele se dando bem no final, teria o mesmo peso emocional no final e ele continuaria lindo porque foi muito lindo de qualquer maneira feita, só teria uns personagens a mais haha.

Watched it in one go (there are only 10 EPs). And I must say, that I can completely understand the rating here on MAL. The whole pacing throughout the anime is totally weird and to fast.Character seem to be happy just a short time after someone died and it doesnt seem like its the ""Im hurt, I want to cry but I will pretend Im happy"" kind of happy. The characters move on to quickly after a lot of deaths. The only ""good"" pacings in death scenes...were [Spoiler] the death of Kunio Hikita (the old convenience store man, ""fine"" pacing) and Koga Haruo (senpai of Ayumu, Good pacing). In general characters often behave very strangely given their situation.The art style/design is occasionally very weird like teenage characters faces looking like they are 40 years old or something, proportions being weird considering der age (huge hands, huge body in general) or they straight up look just like goblins. But in general its a fine art style which could have been (really) good if it were handled accordingly/better and if it werent for the above mentioned flaws.Towards the end there are a few better scences with better pacing etc and the ending in itself reaches from ""okay"" up to ""good"".But those scences arent enough to raise the raiting to a 7.My final rating: 6/10 or 6.5/10 max. were [Spoiler] the death of Kunio Hikita (the old convenience store man, ""fine"" pacing) and Koga Haruo (senpai of Ayumu, Good pacing).

It was beyond dreadful.I am a guy who doesn\'t mind watching things out of my comfort zone. I am a slice of life/romance kind of guy but every now and then I will watch a more ""dark"" and ""edgy"" show, which is why I have Made in Abyss in my plan to watch. I chanced upon this anime and thought to myself, ""Hey this looks interesting, its backed by Netflix, it must have some standard to it right ?"" WRONG.The storyline was dreadful. Like...seriously, the whole of Japan sinking ? I get that it\'s an anime, but that concept would not work. The characters. They really tried to make light out of a very shitty situation where they could all die if they were not careful. But the next thing you know these characters are jumping off waterfalls and fanboying over this foreign youtuber, which is VERY FAR OFF from how people would react in the SAME situation.I had to stop after the third episode because it got so painful to listen to the dialogue and these characters speak in English when it is so damn unnecessary. Visually, I can allow it since animating is very hard work. But my god is the plot and dialogue so badly written.2/10. Could\'ve been a 1/10 but I gave an extra point for the animators.

Based on the 1973 novel, this series delves into the existential personal tragedies that define a crisis, and in the amalgam the collective trauma of a nation lost at sea.For Japan Sinks, the personal is the political, and the series has a lot to say about the latter. One scene depicts a right-wing Japanese nationalist group rescuing only pure Japanese - not those pesky gaijin. From this group’s fate, you can easily tell that the social commentary here isn’t exactly subtle (nor is most of...the show), but maybe it doesn’t have to be.If the series’ politics isn’t as engrossing as it is reassuring, the characters’ journeys are enthralling if slightly predictable. In just ten episodes the series competently fleshes out its ensemble cast, which largely sells its ethos that it’s the people around you who truly matter. Of course, this escalates the vicarious trauma of seeing what these characters endure and overcome (or fail to), including some especially harrowing situations that Japan Sinks almost admirably refuses to sugarcoat for the audience.It’s clear that the creators have as much faith in the good of humanity as Mother Nature is impossibly merciless. And it’s here that Japan Sinks rides this intriguing tonal balance between immense heart and equally immense loss - they probably don’t see those things as mutually exclusive. Crisis brings people together just as much as it fractures communities, and even as the Earth threatens to swallow you whole, the most important thing is to keep moving forward. the show), but maybe it doesn’t have to be.If the series’ politics isn’t as engrossing as it is reassuring, the characters’ journeys are enthralling if slightly predictable.

To start, the story wasn't really similar to anything I've seen, and the concept actually gave me some anxiety. It's pretty realistic and makes it seem like this could actually happen. Which there is a SLIM chance it could, but hopefully it won't.. Next, the art was kinda bland. Not really much detail in the characters, and when there was it was in a very questionable way. (for example, when Kite was on the hot air balloon..) The landscape was detailed enough though, and at times was really pleasing to look at. About the characters. To start,...I honestly kin Go. He is HELLA relatable when it comes to playing video games, and still being able to worry about others at the same time. He was a nice kid and I'm happy about what happened to him in the end! Next, Ayaumu was honestly amazing. She was a good person and often put others before her self! I like her and she was probably one of my favorite characters. Kite was well unique. I kinda hated him at first cause he was sorta self centered. But, as the anime went on he was actually pretty nice. This show ALMOST made me cry at one point, and at others it gave me major anxiety! (regarding who might die, what would happen to the world, etc..) There were some flaws though. I think they killed off way to many people in a very short period of time. Animation/art was honestly not that great most of the show. And the time skip at the end bothered me. The show should've at least went on for 2 season in my opinion. But, I will say it was pretty good none the less, so 7/10 from me! :3 I honestly kin Go.

No, the art looks very old despite its release date and there's a lot of moments that do not make sense. But is this worth watching? Yes, and here's why.This short series is about the main character, Ayumu, trying to find and survive with her family during a natural disaster. Since they live on the island of Japan, trouble keeps occurring and chances of survival get slimmer the longer the show goes on. But this show is less about the earthquake causing Japan to sink, but rather about Ayumu's journey through this crisis.This premise sounds normal enough,...but whatever you were expecting to happen, this show goes further than that. Every episode has something happening, which means there's no stale moments. It's extremely weird and sometimes very cutthroat, but that's what makes it entertaining to watch. It's not to be taken seriously, and there are some moments that are funny because how absurd it is. There are also heart wrenching moments, which is to be expected given the plot, that genuinely make you wonder if the characters will survive this situation.I am not a review writer, and I couldn't care less if this review is good or not, but honestly this show is so stupid that you need to watch it, and so stupid that I decided that my first review is about defending this show.

I will admit, the first two episodes of this show were amazing! The animation, the emotions, I was ready to love this show, but... It all went downhill afterwards.The deaths of certain characters were very unexpected, some made sense and others... just didn't. I feel as though they began looking to shock the audience rather than create  any meaningful character development.Also the concepts...just began to get so strange, ane one concept just did not fit in with the show AT ALL.For now, I dropped it.

The first 2 episodes are great, they create a very tense atmosphere and are very good in presenting the series. However, from the 3rd episode until the end of the cult arc, the quality of the series takes a massive hit. During these episodes, many things happen without any reason or any explanation, and it really ruins the immersion.In the last...few episodes, Nihon Chinbotsu manages to regain some of its qualities. And it is on these that some of the best moments happen. Many people criticised episode 10, but to my mind it worked well to explain the consequences of the disaster and how Japan is recovering.The soundtrack in Japan Sinks is amazing. The tracks fit and manage to convey emotions very well. Some tracks that I really remember are the one that plays when Auyumu is running around the city and the tech one that plays around episode 7 or 8 and reminded me a lot of Devilman.Characters in this show are a mess. Some of them are really likeable and relatable while others are annoying and unrealistic. I really enjoyed watching Haruo develop and come out of his shell, but I couldn't stand Ayumu until the last few episodes.Voice acting is alright when they are not saying random english words just to look like immigrants. Seriously, if it was really necessary to have the main cast speaking english, why didn't the studio try to find VAs who knew how to speak it properly?Overall, I feel like Japan Sinks is definetely worth a watch. If you have enjoyed previous Yuasa works you will definetely get enjoyment from some moments in this show.

However I would not say it is great, it is a 7/10 at best and can be really bad at times."", ""Normally I won't label an anime as terrible or thrash no matter how much I hate it because I know not all anime is for everyone. However this is an exception, Japan Sinks is indeed the worst anime I have seen (the only anime I give 1/10).Minor spoilers ahead! (not like it matters because you shouldn't waste your time on this anime)The first 2 episodes started well but after that everything went downhill. They killed all the characters one by one like AoT, trying to leave an impression for the viewers. It clearly didn't turn out well because each character died without meaning, they just...killed them for the shock effect without contributing anything to the story line.The animation and art is the worst. I could not name any anime that is has a shittier animation than Japan Sinks. Its like the animators didn't even try at all. I feel so embarrassed that this show is categorize as an anime. No adaptation should suffer like this.In conclusion please don't waste your time on this anime. killed them for the shock effect without contributing anything to the story line.The animation and art is the worst.

The backgrounds looked pretty decent for depicting an earthquake-ravaged Japan and did the job for expressing the dilapidated look for that scenario. The characters themselves appeared to be similar in style of what people looked like in the Devilman: Crybaby anime and there\'s not much to add after that. Throughout the anime, the soundtrack was solid in emphasizing the mood of the characters and the world around them, however it seemed off at times. For...example, in transitioning from a sad scene to a more energetic one, there did not appear to be a smooth flow in the music rather a choppy one. If this was the director\'s decision to convey a quick switch of emotion without any time to process previous ones, then I guess that works, just not for my enjoyment of the artwork.Now for what can really make or break an art piece, the story and the characters involved in it. As the synopsis says, the overall plot is motivated by the need to survive and the inevitable moral dilemmas that will come during a natural disaster of that magnitude. While the premise is extremely intriguing, the actual execution was rather mediocre at best. In the first few episodes, there was a scene where our main protagonist Ayumu decided to give water to an elderly couple. This suggested to me that more of these sorts of predicaments and hard decisions were going to forward their journey towards refuge. Instead, this trend was going to define a lot of elements in this story. They will give hints and allude to either a theme or further plot point, but the anime doesn\'t elaborate on it. The anime\'s direction seemed amorphous pointing to themes of discrimination, nationalism, whether or not to trust the government, and dealing with loss. However, when boiled down, the anime\'s message materialized into something like, ""Keep moving forward no matter what, no matter how slow or painful, and it will be alright"". That in of itself isn\'t a bad message to convey, it just wasn\'t built upon as much incorporating other possible themes into the story. The story also includes multiple uses of plot armor and deus ex machinima, when a character miraculously survives or finds a piece of equipment that can whisk the gang away to a more secure location. There were also lapses in logic within the story, with a seemingly nonexistent government that did little to help their own citizens in the greatest natural disaster known to humankind. Additionally, the anime mentioned foreign aid that was never significantly displayed on screen at any time. Should this have occurred in the real world, there would be a global effort on a scale unprecedented to prevent a possible genocide of the Japanese people. Yet in the world of Japan Sinks: 2020, there is no significant support in accepting refugees, finding survivors, delivering supplies, and airlifting people from makeshift airports or landing sites. Aside from the story writing dipping down halfway through there are problems with the characters themselves.As this was made by the same people who produced Devilman: Crybaby, I expected characters to die ALOT in this anime. They both shared a similar tone: one of despair and solemnness, so I instinctively thought this was going to be similar. I was right, but at the same time, while Devilman: Crybaby\'s deaths illustrated a boiling point of humanity\'s greatest sins and hatred, Japan Sinks: 2020\'s deaths felt empty. Those deaths especially felt less impactful when you personally didn\'t care for the characters at all. Though a majority of the characters did develop somewhat as the story progressed, it still felt as if their personalities and motivations were one-dimensional. As an example, Amyumu represented the clingy track runner, her brother Gou as the gamer, their mom as the positive one, their dad as a survivalist, and Kaito as... a youtuber? A youtuber that specializes in kites? In survival as well? The character that somehow knows everything everywhere? The dynamic between the characters at times felt forced and was really awkward at times when they wanted to portray a point. Easily the best character interaction was with Amyumu and Gou as they talked to each other about their parents and their own aspirations. This was probably the high point of any of the characters represented in the anime, as it portrayed what felt like a natural conversation, taking a break from the discussion of the chaos that enveloped their world. Apart from that though, the other characters, in my opinion, we not developed enough or had enough screen time to justify caring for their non-existence.The start of the series was great, but towards the middle and end, it devolved. The start was full of drama and wonder of what would happen next. As it progressed though, the series has a weird detour of a story arc and ending was alright.

However, this anime fails to produce characters that feel important, even through extended screen time dialogue the characters still unimportant when they die.Story (4/10): It\'s an interesting concept they came up with; Japan is a geologically active country so it\'s only natural that the most imaginable natural disaster would be massive earthquakes and tsunami. What downgrades the story is it\'s inability to make anything consistent, and you\'ll understand what I mean if...you saw this anime.Art (5/10): There\'s not much to say except you can tell they skimped out on a lot of animation but some parts were done in good taste, others not so much...Characters (5/10): The characters are probably it\'s biggest shortcoming in that none of them are particularly likable. Go and KITE (and Daniel that 1 episode) are barely tolerable with their Japanglish, but if you watched it in English it might not have been so bad. The manner that that the characters are killed off is also very underwhelming and downright ambiguous at times. One redeeming quality is the amount of diversity among the characters; The old man was a drug addict, The mom was Filipino with two half Japanese kids, the Paralympics were shown, and I think KITE, who was Estonian (very cool country btw) was possibly transgender, but don\'t quote me on that.Enjoyment (6/10): This anime had almost no enthrallment value whatsoever but I did find enjoyment in the array of the environments the characters traversed. I also got a kick out of the weed farm and the Japanese fanatics boat exploding. This anime has very few highlights and I doubt I\'ll even remember anything about this show in the future, but I was able to sit through it and I didn\'t feel like turning it off so...Overall (5/10): If you want to watch a good anime that has cool characters and decent storytelling you\'re sol because this anime is the epitome of completely uninspired. If you have some extra time or need something to play in the background while you do work this anime is perfect because it doesn\'t matter if you watch it or not you\'ll still feel exactly the same afterwards. you saw this anime.Art (5/10): There\'s not much to say except you can tell they skimped out on a lot of animation but some parts were done in good taste, others not so much...Characters (5/10): The characters are probably it\'s biggest shortcoming in that none of them are particularly likable.

While the anime does an amazing job at highlighting the horror that is their world comes crashing down on them, while still making the characters and the people they interact with more relevant than the disaster its self. The challenges they face are those of physical, cultural, social, and even spiritual showcasing what humanity is capable of in times of crisis. Anyone who denies they saw something in the anime that they totally would have done is a liar.The art style can be a bit sloppy at times,...but aside from a few unimportant moments, the animation holds up well enough. I appreciate the quality of their portrayals of death. Sometimes an off-screen death can be used in very powerful ways, and they got it right.The OP is very skippable after the first time you\'ve heard it. But the OST seems to always compliment the ending of each episode pretty well.The characters are really well written, well at least some more than others.The Mother: I want everyone to know, from experience, that is how a Filipino mother would act in that situation. Culture shock, Filipino women are some of the toughest and shouldn\'t be trifled with. She is strong and compassionate and is a fine representation of Philipinos in anime.The Father: A hard-working man who only has his family\'s interest at heart. His actions bring everyone together making him one of the best team leaders. While his hunting and foraging skills seem a bit Mary Sue, his heart is in the right place and you can\'t fault him for that.The Daughter: Young and ignorant, like everyone once was. She acts out and tries to stick to her ideals, but on her journey, she is forced to mature and learn what is and isn\'t important in life.The Son: Wow they did it, they wrote a child character that I actually like. Young and ambitious, but still acts very much like a child. His coping mechanisms throughout the tragedy are realistic for someone of his age.There are other characters that deserve praise but the core of the story revolves around this family.

This is the best way that ""Japan Sinks 2020"" could be described, it is an anime that just does not aim to be one. While arguably over 90% of all anime shows out there tend towards fantasy, the supernatural, futuristic sci-fi, or just have characters with some superhuman capabilities, the show we\'ve got at hand is one of the rare ones that remains entirely realistic at all times and never really breaks into over-the-top action or any other clichés commonly associated with this sort of media.Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 parts from a very...interesting concept: Japan sinking into the ocean due to a mass-scale natural catastrophe. Now, while the premise is indeed interesting, it\'s merely adapted from the novel ""Japan Sinks"", published in 1973, and it is one that\'s been adapted to other type of media: movies, manga, TV shows, etc. This, of course, adapts this story to anime and sets it in the modern day... and it doesn\'t really work too well, due to a myriad of factors. It is worth nothing that Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 is not a direct adaptation of the original novel, and instead takes a lot of creative liberties with the source material while still working with its core, so much of what you will see in this anime is an original experience.Now, where shall we begin? Perhaps the most notorious thing about this ONA is that it entirely breaks out of the regular topics that this sort of media normally deals with, by touching into MANY taboos that anime has always avoided; while most series tend to focus on plots set in alternative worlds, or have a really partial, idealized or superficial vision of Japan and its society, Japan Sinks 2020 jumps straight into the mud by portraying topics very few anime touch on, in a considerably realistic manner: drug use, addiction, rape, mental illness, sociopolitical issues, and the actual impact of death and destruction on people\'s lives and psyches. Throughout the 10 episodes this animation provides, there\'s no shortage of controversial things to be found, many of which might just be rather shocking due to their portrayal being gruesomely realistic for what pretty much is a bunch of drawings with motion. Many characters will sometimes die in sudden, and at times brutal manners, leaving the viewer little time to even process what\'s going on. The absolute breakdown of society as a result of the catastrophe illustrated by this show demonstrates how many individuals can and will let their moral values go down the drain. Everything to be seen here comes off as bleak and depressing, like a bucket of cold water to the average anime viewer who might usually be used to more lighthearted stories, or at least ones that draw a noticeable line between reality and fiction.Reality, and fiction. Yes, a line is drawn somewhere, but in the case of Nihon Chinbotsu 2020, said line is considerably blurred. Regardless of how we may look at things, this is definitely a sci-fi show, because it\'s simply not geologically feasible for Japan to completely sink into the ocean, so the events to be found here remain entirely as a theoretical concept, but within said theoretical concept, we get a very real and very gruesome depiction of what an event like this one could (and likely would) be like. One great thing this anime manages to do is keep you on the edge of your seat, because the plot develops itself in a coherent manner and carries a constant tension, never truly allowing the viewer to feel calm as they expect the unexpected. However, while the story provided to us is rather great and captivating, it is also considerably rushed, and that brings me back to the very first sentence in this review, which points out the main issue with Japan Sinks 2020: this is not a plot designed for an anime.TV shows normally have episodes that last 40–50 minutes. That\'s double the runtime of the average anime\'s episode. In this time, a single arc or event can be developed in a lot more detail than in the roughly 20 minutes of content anime tends to provide per episode. Considering this anime has 10 episodes, the plot is just bound to have a quick pace; that\'s a bit over 3 hours of actual content, excluding OP and ED; it will likely take you longer to read the novel this is based (or more like inspired) on, which has some 300 or 400 pages. The speed at which the plot develops leaves little space for reflection or for some better character development; some heavily shocking events will sometimes happen, such as someone\'s sudden death, and the characters won\'t even really stop to mourn or at least mentally process what just happened, because that would take minutes away from the short timespan in which the plot develops. The end result of this is that every single event here lacks any more impact than perhaps an initial shock, and it then hardly seems to carry over to the rest of the plot.On top of the plot not really working for an anime format, the animation is... bad, honestly. The art style aims towards a certain type of realism; it\'s not flashy nor colorful, instead it uses muted, more realistic color palettes and reduces all the eye candy to create a much grittier image that is much more compatible with what\'s being portrayed. While the animators did a great job with that, the animation still is rather uncomfortable to watch at times: the lines are rough, the different camera angles make the animation look awkward at times, the art style tends towards being realistic, but looks too rough, while the animation often times falls short in terms of detail, and at times attempts at being realistic and instead just creates some rather ugly frames. At times, this feels like an anime from the early or mid 2000s, and it breaks immersion. However, one highlight that must be mentioned is that whenever it comes to portraying the misery of such a disaster or death, the art and animation goes out of its way to be detailed and gruesome: the death of some characters is portrayed in brutal manners, some of the scenes to be seen are way too gory even for the average anime, and the depictions of the ruins of a Japan is very good.The character design is very realistic, but also feels plain and uninspired in its visual aspects. The voice acting isn\'t exaggerated, it feels considerably casual and make all the characters feel much more human than in other similar media. However, one big issue to be mentioned here is that the characters\' personalities are just BAD, and their development is BAD. This show, being a Netflix original, naturally goes out of its way to be uncommonly multicultural, as we see that many of the main characters are not Japanese, or are just half-Japanese. While this is in no way an issue, and if anything, it is a breath of fresh air for the usually-copious anime character design, it does feel rather forced. The ethnicity and origin of the characters does play a role in the plot, but it feels like it does so only for sociopolitical commentary, as it never actually takes any major incidence. One thing that is often just annoying about Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 is how its characters feel completely disconnected from the events happening around them; they\'ll start speaking English randomly, for seemingly no reason, or they will do something odd that feels completely unnecessary, such as taking some 5 minutes of an episode to rap about how they feel, and while this might work to show a sense of normalcy in the face of disaster, it just doesn\'t feel natural, and that\'s in huge part due to how rushed the plot is, not really allowing for events to take any impact or for the viewer to properly notice any shift in a character\'s personality or mood.Now, lastly, there is one more issue with Nihon Chinbotsu 2020, and it is probably the one that can be the most annoying: it is many times absurd. How so? Well, perhaps in the way it portrays society\'s breakdown, tending towards something that\'s more similar to The Last of Us\' scenario rather than what many might consider to be a more realistic outcome in which a lot of people don\'t just become completely uncivilized criminals. Perhaps it is in the way that seemingly all characters die in very unlikely manners. Or perhaps it is in the way one can predict which character will die next, and how. Or perhaps on how it would seem like the protagonists manage to survive almost all situations by the skin of their teeth. As the plot advances, it gets rather annoying and tedious, and all the shock from the events seen in the earlier episodes fails to replicate in the later ones due to it becoming somewhat formulaic.After all of this, though, a question remains: is Japan Sinks 2020 a worthwhile anime? In more than one way, no. Should I watch it? Yes, it is worth watching. This is an anime that was not meant to be an anime, but it is also a story that wouldn\'t have been easy or even good if done as a regular live action TV show. It nevertheless is an interesting experiment in an industry that has perhaps become known for repeating the same concepts to boredom, it is certainly a breath of fresh air and makes for an entertaining experience, albeit a somewhat quality-lacking one. This ONA tries to be more than it can possibly be, and maybe it even falls short on what it can actually be, but it\'s still sometime worth experiencing. Yes, I give this a 7, and a ""Mixed Feelings"" review, because even if it\'s an engrossing anime, it is a bad one in a lot of practical aspects. You should go ahead and give this a try, though, because good or bad, it\'s undeniably a highlight in a massive sea of copious media. interesting concept: Japan sinking into the ocean due to a mass-scale natural catastrophe.

The art style aims towards a certain type of realism; it\'s not flashy nor colorful, instead it uses muted, more realistic color palettes and reduces all the eye candy to create a much grittier image that is much more compatible with what\'s being portrayed. While the animators did a great job with that, the animation still is rather uncomfortable to watch at times: the lines are rough, the different camera angles make the animation look awkward at times, the art style tends towards being realistic, but looks too rough, while the animation often times falls short in terms of detail, and at times attempts at being realistic and instead just creates some rather ugly frames. At times, this feels like an anime from the early or mid 2000s, and it breaks immersion. However, one highlight that must be mentioned is that whenever it comes to portraying the misery of such a disaster or death, the art and animation goes out of its way to be detailed and gruesome: the death of some characters is portrayed in brutal manners, some of the scenes to be seen are way too gory even for the average anime, and the depictions of the ruins of a Japan is very good.The character design is very realistic, but also feels plain and uninspired in its visual aspects. The voice acting isn\'t exaggerated, it feels considerably casual and make all the characters feel much more human than in other similar media. However, one big issue to be mentioned here is that the characters\' personalities are just BAD, and their development is BAD. This show, being a Netflix original, naturally goes out of its way to be uncommonly multicultural, as we see that many of the main characters are not Japanese, or are just half-Japanese. While this is in no way an issue, and if anything, it is a breath of fresh air for the usually-copious anime character design, it does feel rather forced. The ethnicity and origin of the characters does play a role in the plot, but it feels like it does so only for sociopolitical commentary, as it never actually takes any major incidence. One thing that is often just annoying about Nihon Chinbotsu 2020 is how its characters feel completely disconnected from the events happening around them; they\'ll start speaking English randomly, for seemingly no reason, or they will do something odd that feels completely unnecessary, such as taking some 5 minutes of an episode to rap about how they feel, and while this might work to show a sense of normalcy in the face of disaster, it just doesn\'t feel natural, and that\'s in huge part due to how rushed the plot is, not really allowing for events to take any impact or for the viewer to properly notice any shift in a character\'s personality or mood.Now, lastly, there is one more issue with Nihon Chinbotsu 2020, and it is probably the one that can be the most annoying: it is many times absurd. How so? Well, perhaps in the way it portrays society\'s breakdown, tending towards something that\'s more similar to The Last of Us\' scenario rather than what many might consider to be a more realistic outcome in which a lot of people don\'t just become completely uncivilized criminals. Perhaps it is in the way that seemingly all characters die in very unlikely manners. Or perhaps it is in the way one can predict which character will die next, and how. Or perhaps on how it would seem like the protagonists manage to survive almost all situations by the skin of their teeth. As the plot advances, it gets rather annoying and tedious, and all the shock from the events seen in the earlier episodes fails to replicate in the later ones due to it becoming somewhat formulaic.After all of this, though, a question remains: is Japan Sinks 2020 a worthwhile anime? In more than one way, no. Should I watch it? Yes, it is worth watching. This is an anime that was not meant to be an anime, but it is also a story that wouldn\'t have been easy or even good if done as a regular live action TV show. It nevertheless is an interesting experiment in an industry that has perhaps become known for repeating the same concepts to boredom, it is certainly a breath of fresh air and makes for an entertaining experience, albeit a somewhat quality-lacking one. This ONA tries to be more than it can possibly be, and maybe it even falls short on what it can actually be, but it\'s still sometime worth experiencing. Yes, I give this a 7, and a ""Mixed Feelings"" review, because even if it\'s an engrossing anime, it is a bad one in a lot of practical aspects. You should go ahead and give this a try, though, because good or bad, it\'s undeniably a highlight in a massive sea of copious media.', 'Number of Episodes: 10 (about 20 minutes each)Plot: B- *A giant earthquake occurs throughout Japan leading to the eventual sinking of the entire country. The show follows one family as they fight their way to survive an unimaginably horrific disaster. Personally, I felt like the first couple episodes were excellent but then it started to drop in quality, go off on some odd side-stories, and then get ridiculously over-the-top by the end. This probably would have made for an excellent 6 episode series though.Visuals: B+ *The art style of the show was really nice. I liked the character designs. The backgrounds were pretty. And when...people died, it was brutal.Voice Acting: B *I actually watched the sub for this show. For the most part, I don\'t really have many complaints with the voices. I felt like the rap scene about Japan and it\'s significance probably could have been omitted, (and my friend and I who were watching it went back to listen to it in English which he said that the English rap flowed better where I personally thought both parts were cringey but to each their own)Film Score/Soundtrack: B- *Funny, I turned to my friend in the middle of the first episode and told him that the music reminded me of ""A Silent Voice"". So I pulled my phone up as we were watching it to verify and sure enough, I found out it was the same composer. Still, outside of a pretty melodies, there were hardly any songs that stuck out to me like in ""A Silent Voice"" which had quite a few songs that spur up emotions from me.Characters: C- *This show could have been something if the group of characters were memorable and at the very least likable. But most of the characters that actually are likable end up dying. I liked Gō, KITE, Mari, Koichiro, and Nanami. The rest were either just goofy, not team players, not memorable, or didn\'t last long enough to bother caring about.Cringeworthy Anime Moments: The one anime trope that I can think of is the power-level of the elderly. And let\'s just say that there was a certain shopkeeper that was far better with a crossbow than any normal human being could ever hope to be. This dude straight up strolls in a wheelchair and snipes armed personnel with his crossbow, spins in his chair to reflect the bullets being fired at him, and upon finishing the spin, shoots down the last guy before continuing moving through the compound. Not only that, later on he was sniping people from pretty far distances at night while going through a morphine withdrawal. None of this was necessary. This was a disaster show! Why did a cliche shonen elder crossbow warrior master have to appear out of nowhere? Lol!Also, Gō\'s Japamericanese throughout the show was really funny.For the most part though, there weren\'t a lot of anime tropes, but this show had a lot of disaster movie tropes. The way the show started out with the mass-destruction and the vivid deaths and the chaos a massive earthquake could cause was scary because of how unpredictable it was. This was a massive-scale quake that decimated an entire country. And we got to see a bunch of people get killed up close in brutal ways that all seem very plausible if an earthquake of that magnitude were to hit Japan like that for real. After the initial shock value for how brutal the show was going to be, the writers wanted more creativity with the upcoming deaths and I think it took away from the horror that the opening sequence had. After the opening sequence, even though the deaths in the show remained unpredictable, the nature of how the people died either was just bizarre, stupid, or out-right ridiculous. (I\'m looking at you shark attack lol!) My friend and I just started laughing as people started to die in really stupid ways. The show became more of a meme than something I could take seriously. ""Died for yam to feed the fam.""Opening Titles: B *Unique and really pretty artwork with a pretty and peaceful song to go with it. I enjoyed this opening.Final Verdict: 3/10 *A show with a really interesting premise that sadly wore out its welcome rather quickly. Cut the total number of episodes in half, remove some of the ridiculous shock-value deaths, keep it focused on the actual plot of Japan sinking and cut out the random side-story with the weird cult, and make some of the heroics less far-fetched and they might have had something. But instead, we have a mess of a show that had a great start. Also, why wasn\'t my man Gō the main character? His sister Ayumu was far less likable and her wishy-washy attitude literally led to the deaths of several others. people died, it was brutal.Voice Acting: B *I actually watched the sub for this show.

I saw the preview and thought to myself, ""that looks kinda cool"", but it wasn\'t. The pacing was awful, the dub was awful, the animation was awful, there was almost nothing I liked about this. It started off somewhat good and it quickly went downhill from there becoming more and more painful to watch. All the characters were dropping like flies dying left to right for stupid reasons, and when they did die NOBODY CARED and mean that for both the characters and the people watching. This is because we barely know anything about them, they haven\'t gave us time to...connect woth these characters not only that but their personalitys are weak. Highly recommend skipping this one. connect woth these characters not only that but their personalitys are weak.

Some of the deaths are so out of the blue it feels like they forgot to put them in till last minute.The art is nice, not for everyone (lots of messy lines and faded colours) but the animation is some of the worst I have ever seen, sometimes a person will be running and it just shows them out of nowhere. Fan made webtoon trailers on youtube have better animations.I also did enjoy the OST it displayed more emotion than any of the characters and will definitely stand out as the best part of the series.Just do not waste your time, the plot gets so loose by the end you don't know what is even happening and as cute as Kite may have been he can not save this disaster. and an interracial family which was nice but for every good thing this show does thee are twice as many thing to go wrong.

The better circumstances part is more like as long as we don't have to sit through the way that middle part played out again.

That's pretty much it without going into really spoiler type things."", 'Let’s get right into this review for this show. I first heard of this show through a podcast that described how accurately it portrayed the alarms and codes that Japan has when an earthquake occurs and so my interest was piqued. Upon watching the first episode, I was astounded! The animation, music, and its portrayal of an earthquake event occurring was incredible. However, upon hitting the third episode, everything went downhill quickly. Following its name, the show began to sink, as the bar it set for itself was far too high for it to carry throughout its entirety of the show. Quickly, you’d see the...animation quality drop, making the nice visuals an aspect it lost. However, that would have been fine if that’s all that went wrong. Animation quality can assist in making a show much more pleasant to view, but if its contents diminish with it, there isn’t much left to enjoy.Let me further explain. The characters you are acquainted with become incredibly flawed characters, which would be fine had they seen development in the episodes that followed them. However, these flawed characters, specifically the main protagonist, would make the worst mistakes possible and have almost no responsibility felt. What I mean is that, regardless of what results became of their actions, an example being a character dying, as episodes progressed, nothing was learned. Repetition of said action that would cause a character death, would occur again and the show expects you to feel pity and sorrow for the character as if they had not caused the result to occur.Not only that, but it felt it could have been at least average had it not padded out its run time with what felt like filler episodes, which surrounded a cult. These episodes held nothing of value and muddied anything that the show could have been trying to meaningfully portray. Overall the show was a complete mess. It could bring you a laugh, but regardless of that, it wasn’t a good ride so thus, it gets a bad rating from me. animation quality drop, making the nice visuals an aspect it lost.

CONTAINS SPOILERS.Cons:Japan Sinks 2020 had amazing potential that I felt was left unfulfilled. The first two episodes were fantastic but I was slightly upset by the fact that everyone got over the fathers brutal death so quickly. An explosion like that should’ve left some type of trauma on all characters. The only areas that was evident was in Ayumu. Speaking of which, Ayumu’s character was much too child-like for her age of which got annoying until she started to redeem herself. Her character on its’ own made me almost drop the whole...show. A second factor that almost made me drop the entire show was all episodes in Shan City. It was too ridiculously out of place for a show such as this. I would have preferred the show to continue as it was in the beginning and end episodes. This is also completely personal, but I was not a big fan of the animation style. At times it was sloppy and the body proportions were not consistent. The rapping scene was kind of weird too lol.Pros:On a brighter note, the reason why I rated this show a 7 was because of the serious topics it covered. Especially in the first two episodes, the reality of natural disasters was effectively shown. As well, in Shan City, I enjoyed the normalization of marijuana usage in Japan as this is not often particularly covered in Japanese media (although that was the only thing I liked about Shan City). In the finale, it was great to see the potential progression of Japan in terms of their views on LGBTQ+ relationships (shown by the two male politician’s kissing). The show also covered topics such as drug addiction, racism and showed the importance of people of all cultures working together. It also highlighted the difficulty mixed asians have with their identity and others perception. For these reasons, I gave this show a 7/10 (more accurately 6.5 but thats not an option). show.

More like Japan Stinks 2020, am I right?Story: 5- I think there is a solid base for a good story here. The premise of a Japan sinking into the ocean due to a series of extremely strong earthquakes has merit and promise that is never met. Having a single family as the entry point into the story is a smart way to take something on such a large scale feel personal. Disaster stories and end of the world scenarios have an inherit amount of tension, drama, and action built it but there are executed quite poorly here.Art: 3- Netlfix seems...to think that this style of art is good/popular. I\'d be curious to hear from someone that actually enjoys this art style that looks like a flash video from the early 2000s. Character design is lazy and uninspired. The action sequences are not very dynamic and do not hold your attention. The only redeeming part of the art is the background stills. Some are animated beautifully but I don\'t watch anime for the stills.Sound: 7- I can\'t really complain about the score, voice acting or sound effects. The music choices feel appropriate, sound effects sound realistic, and the voice actors are doing their best to make the best out of really weak writing. There\'s nothing over the top good about the sound but it was never bad.Character: 3- Never in a series where so many of the primary characters die have I cared less. There is not a compelling character in this series. Some light spoilers in this section. We\'ll start with the primary family. The father has some redeeming qualities, he\'s smart, resourceful, good natured, and a leader. So of course he is killed off early and in one of the dumbest ways I\'ve ever seen on screen. The mother floats back in forth between being annoyingly optimistic and having no personality at all. She gets a lot more screen time, also ends up dying in an incredibly uninspiring way. Both parents, as well as mostly every other character that isn\'t one of the children, seem to exist in this story only to die for ""dramatic effect."" The son is generic and boring. The daughter as the ""main"" character is bland and every emotional moment from her feels forced and contrived. All the characters that come in contact with this family seem to all be smart enough to have survived the initial disasters but not smart enough to not die in some of the dumbest ways you\'ve ever seen. The only reason this is a 3 and not worse is the old man addicted to morphine that fires his bow and arrow at everyone. He provides a small spark.Enjoyment: 2- I am a completist, once I start the show, I finish it. This is one of the most difficult things I have ever had to sit through. Thank god it was only 10 episodes. In the entirety of the series, I had one genuine moment of pure enjoyment and it lasted about 5 seconds. I don\'t have much more to say about this other than that I regret starting this show in the first place.Overall: 3- I disliked this show much it inspired me to write my first review on MAL ever. I don\'t like letting reviews deter me from watching something typically but I implore you all, skip this one. Amateurish is the best way to describe it. I never want to spend another second thinking about this series. Its already taken enough of my life I can\'t get back.

I just feel very disappointed because the concept of survival through mother nature\'s harshest challenges could have been portrayed in an even more dramatic and story-rich note. Throughout my whole sitting of Japan Sinks: 2020, I sadly did not feel any sort of connection towards the world of ""apocalypse Japan."" The characters could have been developed even further to create a greater following to root for through the Japan Sinks journey, and the story should...have took a slower, more concise pace to leave satisfaction towards the finish, and not more unanswered questions brought about by confusing plot additions and very poor character buildup and development.Overall, I do feel very disappointed because the concept they have started would have been a thriller, and an eye-opener of an anime to all who watched it, although sadly the poor execution of the portrayal of Japan\'s struggles throughout mother nature\'s reign of terror made such an interesting idea sadly never reach its full potential. have took a slower, more concise pace to leave satisfaction towards the finish, and not more unanswered questions brought about by confusing plot additions and very poor character buildup and development.Overall, I do feel very disappointed because the concept they have started would have been a thriller, and an eye-opener of an anime to all who watched it, although sadly the poor execution of the portrayal of Japan\'s struggles throughout mother nature\'s reign of terror made such an interesting idea sadly never reach its full potential.', ""So much potential wasted.

Japan Sinks 2020 is an anime true to its name; Japan goes through a natural disaster that ends up sinking the entire country.Story (7/10): The plot might be the only good thing about this show. The story seems intriguing and it does a good job portraying the story in the beginning. But it loses direction midway and tries to add side stories that I couldn't care much about. The ending wraps it up well though.Art (5/10): The art is one of Masaaki Yuasa's worst. I don't know if it was due to budget...or less production time but there are only 3 episodes with good or passable animation. The rest of the episodes feel like slideshows made by a middle schooler.Characters (6/10): I really have a huge problem with this show's characters. Either they feel like the most half-assed characters or the most real ones. This really depends on the voice acting done by the cast. In some scenes, the acting is so bad that it ruins the entire enjoyment of the show. But for some odd reason, there are like 2 or 3 scenes where the acting is just so good. I won't spoil but there is one scene in the show that was so good that it felt like an hour. I don't know why but the cast somehow fucks up most of the scenes but does so well in a few others.Overall, this is an absolute train wreck with only about 2 good episodes. I find this hard to recommend unless you're interested in apocalyptic shows. The direction of the show is appalling except for a few scenes and the art is inconsistent. It is very bad in most of the run time but also very good in a few scenes. or less production time but there are only 3 episodes with good or passable animation.

Unfortunately, I came closer to hating it than loving it.Animation (5/10)Of course I know how difficult it is to animate and that in itself is a feat, BUT it felt very awkward a lot of the time and it felt like half way through they switched styles. That shouldnt happen in this short of a show.Sound (4/10):The happy bits sounded like generic ""influencer"" happy music, and the sad points felt like they came from a sample of piano music online. Neither were...necessarily bad, but my LORD was it uninspired.Characters (4/10):This is my MAIN gripe with the show, even if its silly and mainly my fault. I CANNOT STAND how often these characters switch between English and Japanese. Its definitely a weird peeve to have but by the time I even realize theyre speaking English, the sentence is almost over and I entirely missed what they said. Not that its important though, since most of the shit they say in English is silly anyway (""game over"" ""wow!"" ""all right"" stuff like that).Other than that, the characters just felt uninspired. The only two who made me feel something were KITE and the mom. Not enough, considering the large cast of characters swarming in and out.Plot (3/10):Ok, the whole sinking thing is fine. But seriously the only thing thats gonna stick in my head from this show is the 2 cult episodes? Like for a show with only 8 (10?) episodes, thats why to much time to be spending on a subplot that pretty much amounts to nothing other than rescuing the bed ridden guy. Also how the family entirely ignores the fact that they know Japan is about to sink and just decide to stay there despite having the obvious option to leave.The rest is fine, I guess. I mean, it lives up to its name. Theyre trying to escape an earthquake and Japan sinks. Like thats all there is to it, really.Ending/ONLY REDEEMING PART (7/10):Despite calling this the redeeming part, it still only gets a 7/10 cause its only a bit less uninspired than the rest. Long story short, everyone who survives gets what they wanted and they look back at their memories. I think it was a nice touch that they included the first words (I think) about the glowing lights in their garden at the end again.All in all, pretty bad show with a lot of violence and stuff. Does what it says it will. Imagine what happens and youll probably make up as good of a plot as this one because the only interesting plot device in my opinion was KITE.

Also, I may compare it to devilman crybaby a few times since they're from the same guy.SO. This anime really surprised me. I hated, absolutely despised dmcb, but I really enjoyed this show! I thought the characters were interesting and well written, and genuinely cared about their deaths, unlike in dmcb. I noticed some parallels, like how the world goes to shit really fast, rapping, etc.Story: 6LOVED the story. They definitely could've added an episode or two on what the hell was going on. I enjoyed the basic story - natural disasters/japan is sinking. But...the bigger details were completely left out. There were things I just straight up didn't understand. How does the family know Nanami and Harou? This is only BRIEFLY mentioned. Lot's of details are left out. How did Kite get that green (navy/military?) boat. How did he manage to get on said boat and rescue the bed-ridden scientist (I forgot his name). How did the dad get the shovel in the beginning, etc. Lot's of details are left out and it gets annoying.Art: 3I don't like the creator's art style at all. I don't vibe with it. But that's just my opinion.Sound: 3Nothing memorable. Was there any music at all? Idek. If there was it wasn't bad or anything though. Just didn't really add to the story in my opinion.Character: 9Again with the leaving out details! If only I knew more about some of the characters. However, I did really like Kite and the main family. Kite was just enjoyable to watch and listen to, and the family definitely was interesting to go on that journey with.Enjoyment: 10Besides the missing details, I really enjoyed this anime. There's not much else to say besides that lol. Definitely a tear jerker though! Dmcb didn't make me cry but this made me sob. the bigger details were completely left out.

My guess for the low reviews is due to the audience being to young and not fare well with ""loss"" and very adult themes in general.  Which is something you will be experience a lot in this anime, sometimes it will be very brutal... and gory hence why I think the artistic direction for this anime fits... here\'s why:Artistic direction, although is not your tipical bright Anime show, it actually fits the Anime mood very well. Has the show isn\'t exactly your happy go lucky show and things don\'t go the way you expect most...of the time.Sound wise, was good enough in my opinion.If you been wanting to watch a seinen show, this is one you can watch, I think the middle part of the Anime was a bit weird, but anything past the Cult part is still quite good.I wouldn\'t say this is a master piece by any means but been a while since I watched anything remotely close to Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 and this one fits the bill. But the current 6 rating on MAL, I find it very unjustified. of the time.Sound wise, was good enough in my opinion.If you been wanting to watch a seinen show, this is one you can watch, I think the middle part of the Anime was a bit weird, but anything past the Cult part is still quite good.I wouldn\'t say this is a master piece by any means but been a while since I watched anything remotely close to Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 and this one fits the bill. But the current 6 rating on MAL, I find it very unjustified.', 'Alright people, my biggest question as I watched the show was: why?Just why? Why did anyone let this be produced?What was the point of this show?You can do so much with the concept of ""Japan sinking."" SO much! I can come up with a whole list that has better content than this show. If they were going to go the unrealistic route, then why not add aliens that had a grudge with Japan and decided to blow it up? God.Like everyone said in other reviews, the characters were the worse. Like uber stupid, unrelatable, dumb. Everyone is attacking the mom for being the worst--...yes I agree-- but the daughter is even dumber. She was useless, bratty, complaining, and PLAIN STUPID. If  the creator really wanted her to lose a leg and still run in the end, they shouldn\'t have given so many chances for her to disinfect and bandage her stupid wound. Just imagine, having your leg amputated because you were just that stupid to not use the clean bandages around you to cover up the wound. I don\'t get it, did she want to lose a leg? Was that her goal all along? Who knows, obviously she didn\'t seem too distressed about anything. Literally, why did all these people sacrifice themselves to save such a dumb dumb?NO ONE seemed to care about anything. I freaking get a cut on my finger and I immediately go into panic mode. I mean, I know they are in survival mode, but come on! The father (who is played by Keith <3 what a waste of his voice) literally, LITERALLY gets blown for the stupidest reason, yeah to get his bratty daughter a freaking yam because she can\'t eat anything else. Like ? If the country is being destroyed, getting your daughter a yam should be the least of your concern. She deserved a big smack in the head and they should\'ve said, ""Quit your b*tching and eat whatever we have or starve."" Clearly, they had to kill the dad since he had natural survival instincts and they had to find a way to  make the family suffer. But come on, being blown by a bomb just to feed the daughter???? HA, what a joke. Let\'s not even mention I hate her voice and the way she talked.No one cries for the dad. They act like he didn\'t die but went on vacation instead. Just like ""I miss dad. I want to talk to him."" That\'s all. All of the characters were unrelatable. After the useless, annoying, dumb daughter, the next most annoying character is the mom.Ah, the mom. The positive person in the group... let\'s just say too positive. Her husband died? No big deal. We move on. Her friend died? No big deal, let\'s take a pic. Let\'s take a pic. ""I won\'t cry but I will take a pic."" Literally what? There was no shock in her face. No despair. Like, I know characters that are positive but still show pain in their face. Just look at, IDK, Dazai. He clearly shows signs of depression but he also puts on a happy face to lighten the mood. But the mom? No sign of anything but carelessness. Wow, she cried once for her dead husband, for like two minutes. Such a loving wife.It\'s not just the daughter or the mom. It\'s the entire family and characters. I just knew there was something wrong with them the minute the mom reunited with the family in the first episode. Chilling, laughing, no sense of alarm in their voice or faces. They just chilled on the blanket as there were explosions and stuff. No biggie. NOthing wrong here.Then (God, I can write on forever), the YouTuber............. just why? (Sorry, Aleks LE, your voice had to be wasted here) Why, why was there a random YouTuber, who\'s not even from Japan, who decided to stay in a country that was going to sink? For the thrill? Yep that was the reason, but like ? Does anyone even do that? Knowing that everyone is evacuating and they might die? I guess, there might be a stupid person to do that. I don\'t get the purpose of having him being a foreigner lol. He could\'ve just been a Japanese and just stayed for the love and excitement for his country. There was like zero reason for him to travel with the family though. Like did he like the girl or something? But just like everything, they never elaborated with that.Honestly, I like zoned out during the episodes of the cult. Like huhhhh? Why was there a random cult and what was the purpose of it? Why did they have magic? And if they had magic and stuff, couldn\'t they have helped out somehow? Idk, I don\'t get it.Finally, let\'s go  back to how unrealistic this show is. You see, when you are in survival mode, you use the resources around you. The first random death was the girl Nanami\'s. Death by instant poison gas. No one else around her died. The daughter was literally right behind her, but noooo, she didn\'t die only Nanami did. Again, no one cared. They just continued talking to the YouTuber. Ha. Then the mom\'s death. They didn\'t even try to cut the rope lol. She had HEART ISSUES but no one offered to do anything and let her just dive in. And no, even though her device was losing battery, the girl said she could charge it with the boat... ...... No one carried a knife or anything sharp? There were stuff floating by everywhere to be used. But no, the mom had to dive allll the way in the deep, cold, dark water (which was so deep, idk how she even made it without oxygen but ok). Mom died, no reaction, nothing just one minute crying and then they\'re like bye bye and move on.The dude Koga literally had impaled shoulder, and they said not to move around, but he was moving stuff, carrying things, runnning lalala, and no one said anything. And then he died. And no one cared. At least the daughter cries a little for everyone, I guess.Then the final episode comes (finally.) The creators tried making it look like a bitter-sweet, touching, sentimental ending, but I just was so confused. They didn\'t even explain how the Professor and his coworker knew about the earthquakes. How they knew about the islands rising again. Like what voodoo is this? Then they show 8 years later. The girl gets to run and the brother gets to compete as well. And magically, everyone goes back to Japan and will try to live there again... And that is the ending. The end.

The mouth on the sister is...obviously done for a reason but sort of ruins her character a little bit.The sound is a good average.The characters again continuing but with this time actually seeing the now-deceased mum which was a super nice touch.
