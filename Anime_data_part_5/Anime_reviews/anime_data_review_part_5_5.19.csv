Ikkitousen: Great Guardians Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5333/Ikkitousen__Great_Guardians_Specials,"[""Worthy of a 10!For those who are fans of the ikkitousen series and love fan service, these special episodes are a treasure for the viewer.In this special the main characters go through challenges with the real goal of pleasing the fans of the series with fan service of the best quality. The situations they go through are unprecedented and satisfy the viewers' desires.The only negative point of these special episodes is the short time per episode. Other than this small detail, this work is worthy of a 10!Those who don't like the work don't know how to appreciate a fine fan service. "", 'Im surprised no one has written a rage review of this. The Ikkitousen Great Guardian Specials are definetly ""something"". You may get a good laugh from 3/5 2 minute episodes. If anything I was disappointed with the actual content and especially how Kakouen was portrayed(I wasnt happy about that). Anyways the fanservice is at a low for most of the episodes. Ova 2 and 5 were the only ones which seemed like Ikkitousen fanservice. Generally the episodes where very bland. I certainly was not expecting a story or maximum level content but this was a bit poor. If your a fan of the series I...would recommend watching it, but do not expect much.Story 5Enjoyment...meh 7Overall 6 would recommend watching it, but do not expect much.Story 5Enjoyment...meh 7Overall 6', ""Plain and simple fan service. The scenes are introduced by resident milf Goei in what looks like some sort of variety show 4th wall break format. Because of these intros and outros the scenes themselves really only last a minute or so and are just barely the thinnest excuse for setting up some raunchy lewd camera angles and as much exposed skin as they can show without having to pixelate it. I'll say what I always say in regard to shows and specials like this: there is real hentai out there for you to watch, this is just porn with extra steps. 5/10 ""]"

The cultivation system does seems a little confusing at first cause it has more than one, but eventually it's possible to get a grasp of it. I watched because there were supposed to...be romance, and there is (eventually), and also a lot of girls have an interest in the MC.The first girl may seem angry all the time, but often she has a reason to, she has a strong personality and she kinda grows on you. Hope it continues. be romance, and there is (eventually), and also a lot of girls have an interest in the MC.The first girl may seem angry all the time, but often she has a reason to, she has a strong personality and she kinda grows on you.

Kemeko Deluxe!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3464/Kemeko_Deluxe,"[""Oh no! Here comes another harem parody/comedy based show (with a sci-fi twist). I normally wouldn't write a review for shows like this, but all this mediocre content is beginning to get depressing (still, some people may be entertained by it).Kemeko DX (or Kemeko Deluxe to give it it's proper title), began life as a manga series by Iwasaki Masazaku, which began serialization in Dengeki Comic Gao! magazine in October 2007, before being transferred to it's sister publication Dengeki Daioh! in February 2008 as the former magazine ceased publication. The anime version was produced by Hal Film Maker, and was directed by Mizushima Tsutomu, who...also directed Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan!, Genshiken (1st series and OVA), Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu, and xxxHOLiC (both series and the movie). With a decent director at the helm, I was expecting a little more from this show than something like To-LOVE-Ru, but Kemeko DX failed to deliver the kind of laughs I was hoping for.The story is, once again, a mish-mash of the standard harem fare. Kobayashi Sanpeita, a teenage boy, reminisces about his first love, a pink haired girl he met ten years previous, when a strange metallic chibi-woman bursts into his room and states that she is his wife. This is Kemeko, a &quot;mech&quot; for want of a better word, and the pilot bears a striking resemblance to the girl Sanpeita fell in love with.The story then introduces the rest of the cast, which include all the typical harem characters - the childhood friend, the loli sister, the sidekick, the quiet girl, the combative girl, etc, etc. As I said, typical harem fare.Art and animation for the show could have been done much better than it was. Given Mizushima's pedigree with shows like xxxHOLiC and Genshiken, I was disappointed to find the character designs were generic at best. The scenery is often standard fare, and could well have been taken straight out of any harem anime. The only plus point on the side of the animation is that the fights were sometimes well done, and that there are numerous parodies in the show which can draw a laugh - sometimes.Sound is, again, generic at best. The OP is decent enough, although the ED can get annoying very fast. The VA's are once again, generic at best. Don't expect any great acting in this show, as it's not meant to be there. Tomatsu Haruka, the VA for M.M. (Kemeko's pilot), seems to be being groomed to take over the tsundere roles from Kugimiya Rie (Shana, Louise, Nagi Sanzenin, etc), especially as the character design for M.M. makes her look like Shana/Louise/Nagi. Strangely enough, Kemeko is actually voiced by Saito Chiwa (it would have been nice to have the one VA dealing with both roles but you can't have everything).The sound effects are fair at best. They're generally used well, however the lack of overall background effects causes the show to lack a certain degree of &quot;atmosphere&quot;.The main gripe I have with this show is the characters. I'm getting very tired of seeing the same, generic, fill-in-the-blanks style character in this type of show. Sanpeita, for example, is a useless teenager who has to rely on others all the time. Add to this his tendency to lose all higher brain functions when he sees breasts, his indecisive nature, his inability to put two and two together, and his constant and annoying whining and you have the stereotypical harem comedy lead. M.M. is the generic tsundere female lead, complete with revealing outfit. Makihara Izumi is the generic, large breasted childhood friend who has secret feelings for Sanpeita.Are you beginning to see the trend yet?There isn't any real character growth in this show, and it may have been forgiven this lack if the show was actually good. However, due to it's mediocre nature the show should have really gone down a different avenue, instead pf trying to copy shows like To-LOVE-Ru, Shakugan no Shana, Zero no Tsukaima, etc, etc.So, will you enjoy this show? Maybe, if you've had your sense of humour surgically removed, or have had a lobotomy recently. The show does have some humourous moments, however the attempts at humour often tend to pale in comparison to other shows. Instead of comedy on the level of Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu, we have humour that even a hyena would find unfunny.I don't think that I can, in good conscience (which is a rarity for me), actually recommend this to anyone. It's not a bad show, but it's not a good show either. It's not actually anything, so if you're in the market for mind numbing twaddle that will soften your brains then feel free to watch this. You may even enjoy it (you never know).Personally though, I prefer my humour to actually be funny. also directed Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan!, Genshiken (1st series and OVA), Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu, and xxxHOLiC (both series and the movie).

It’s supposed to be a random action-comedy that parodies other anime and pop culture.  Despite featuring a cast of some of the industry’s top seiyuu talent, all this series manages to be is an uninspired, mean-spirited, and unfunny waste of one’s life.Kemeko DX's premise is convoluted and slightly original in its presentation.  A typical boring male protagonist and high school student (shocking huh?) Sanpeita finds himself with a sudden bride; a violent, scantily clad unnamed girl who pilots a chibi-fied combat robot...named Kemeko.  She claims she loves him, I mean who wouldn’t he’s such an interesting guy (That’s sarcasm BTW), and she must protect him from the evil Mishima corporation whose building dominates the towns skyline.  What they want with him and what it actually means is poorly explained and unresolved by the end of the series.  I am unsure if this means that a future season is coming to complete the story or if this is just another typical harem-comedy shitty ending.  I mean they are almost synonymous with one another.The series humor is random and spastic and it’s not meant to be taken seriously.  So I wasn’t going into this expecting a deep story and complex characters.  But I do expect a comedy to be funny.  Kemeko DX uses mostly physical humor, sexual innuendos, and boobs to drive its comedy.  The problem is it’s just not funny to anyone with any degree of sophistication.  A typical episode involves one of the many girls angst over wanting to be in love with the bland lead and him getting his ass kicked by them or Kemeko, even though he’s done nothing wrong.  In that sense the cruel violent humor reminds me of shows like Punie-chan and Dokuro-chan.  I know the target audience of this show has to be teenage boys, and I just don’t understand why, beyond the fan service, a guy would like this sort of thing.  Do guys really want to be around these crude annoying girls?The most pathetic aspect of the series is definitely the characters.  The lead Sanpeita is so ordinary and uninspired that he is completely uninteresting and the viewer will feel nothing for him one way or another.  The most exasperating part of his character is why the hell he puts up with all of these mean girls who are constantly hurting him or making his life hell.  At the top of the list is Kemeko/M.M. who claims to love him and wants to be his bride.  Besides being very moe and cute when she’s out of her ugly robot she is totally unlikable. The rest of the cast is full of cute girls with mostly gravity and physics defying breasts and body measurements.  They are all bitches.  Seriously, even the most violent feminist bone in my body doesn’t have any sympathy for any of these airheads.  Except one, kind of, and that’s Izumi.  She was the only character who I felt any genuine feelings for because I knew how things were going to end for her.  She’s the only member of the cast who you feel actually cares for the guy and is not a complete bitch.  Of course we know how the childhood friend of the lead usually plays out romantically in these kinds of stories when up against aliens or mystery girls.Animation and art is also bad.  While the girls are cute and the action is pretty well delivered I can’t get past the tremendously ugly male characters.  I mean what is up with that.  They don’t even look like they are from the same art team when you compare them to the female cast.  It’s like the art team had so much money in their budget for development costs and clearly decided the best course of action would be to put 99% of that money into the girls and boob physics.  Sanpeita looks like he’s 10 and even the colors and detail of his character seem to only point out how dull and lifeless he is.  I am also so tired of the same boring spiky hairdos.  Get some new ideas already Japan.Music and acting is mixed.  As I mentioned at the beginning, Kemeko DX features a stellar voice cast and their performances are all pretty good.  Unfortunately the material they were given to work with is bad, and no matter how talented you are you can’t turn this steaming pile of turds into a chocolate cake.  The music kind of fits the random and silly themes but I didn’t particularly like any of them.  The OP theme grows on you a little though.I found very little enjoyment out of watching this show.  For a comedy there were very few moments I felt the need to smile much less laugh out loud.  I did feel something once during my viewing but later realized it was only because I was sitting on my remote control.  My suggestion is that everyone avoids this series like you would a venereal disease. named Kemeko.

After To Love-Ru and countless other same harem series with comedic + ecchi moments...this is as far as this series goes for me. Also redundant are the loli sister, comic one at school and of course...school setting.Art: 7/10Artwork is good but with some roughly drawn battle scenes and under-par chibi shots, it needs some improvements on this department. HAL is known to make cutesy animation type but so far, this needs some work.Sound:...6/10OP and ED themes are catchy but not much charisma to draw much attention to most viewers. BGM and SE from the scenes are also normal with not much spice in it to entice.Character: 8/10Probably, this department is the only one that excels on this rating, mainly due to veternan VA being utilized effectively for each of the characters. With the likes of Chiwa Saito, Rie Kugimiya, Ryoko Shiraishi, Eri Kitamura, Lala-san (Haruka Tomatsu) and loli-voiced Mai Goto in the VA line-up, each of them portrayed unique characteristics such as Sanpeita (Eri), Kemeko and Emuemu (Haruka and Chiwa) and the unusual deviation of Rie Kugimiya from tsundere character to a different one for this anime.Enjoyment: 6/10At the first few episodes, I admit I was laughing off the jokes and comic situations even with the sexual innuendos and ecchi moments but as it progresses, the comical side slowly fades and becomes repetitive. I'm hoping that the series will finish on a good note since Kemeko DX is just slated for maybe a 13 or 24 episode run.Overall: 7/10Kemeko DX was supposed to be a fresh approach for this year's Fall Anime Lineup but with the recent disappointment of To Love-Ru and my epic failure of a rating to Kamen no Maid Guy, we hope that this series would make a turn for the good but I remain pessimistic since most sudden-GF/ecchi/harem series ended up a sour taste in an otaku's mouth.Recommend? - Maybe to those who want a few good laughs in the beginning...Replay Value (Once?) - Uhhh, maybe just for the LULZ yeah..(Twice?) - I don't think its necessary.A second season might fill in BIG GAPS in the story next time, who knows? ^_^Thanks for taking time to read. ^__^ 6/10OP and ED themes are catchy but not much charisma to draw much attention to most viewers.

First Dokuro-chan and now this.Kemeko DX is another in a long string of ""comedies"" as of late that try to combine several different genres of anime into one in an attempt to be funny. You have gun fights, fan service, parodies, a girl with a giant sword, maids and even some sci-fi undertones as well. Unfortunately, the series pulls none of this off at all. It has good art, aaaaannnnndddd that\'s about it.Part of the reason is because the cast is so uniformly...unlikable and stereotypical. Sanpieta is a wimp, Kemeko\'s actions border on the psychotic, Izumi\'s the lame ""childhood friend"" with big breasts, Misaki is the obligatory perverted girl, and Ryouko the aforementioned girl with the big sword. Sanpieta also has an annoying little sister who mouths off at him every opportunity she can, with her mother being an unfunny knockoff of Mama from Kodocha. I wonder how many minutes the original manga creator spend thinking of this cast of characters!As if that wasn\'t enough, the series\' plot is so misguided I thought I was watching the episodes out of order like with Haruhi when I watched the fansubs. Nothing\'s explained until the final episode, and even then the show has the audacity to thrown in a new character in the series\' final moments. It could\'ve (and should\'ve) been plotless: at least then my intelligence wouldn\'t have been insulted.Even the audio is weak. The voice acting is atrocious and the both the opening and ending themes blow. In fact, the latter is one of the worst ending themes I\'ve ever heard in any show, let alone anime. (In case you\'re curious what it is, it\'s a trio of those ugly-as-sin Kemeko robots dancing while a ""dancing exercise"" video plays, where Chiwa Satou squeaks out random usages of the words ""gorgeous"" and ""sexy"", neither of which describes Kemeko at all.)Kemeko DX is a bad show, but even bad shows can be funny. Here, the humor might be funny if it wasn\'t so mean-spirited. For example, episode 7 has Kemeko chasing Sanpieta with a running chainsaw in an attempt to get him to exercise. Another has him almost getting killed by Misaki\'s sister, mistaking the boy for an intruder. Then she acts like nothing happened later! Oh, and don\'t forget the numerous times his ""friends"" beat him up or smack him for being a pervert / cheating on his ""girlfriend"" Kemeko.That\'s just it, though. The biggest problem with Kemeko DX is, well, Kemeko herself. She\'s obnoxious, selfish, mean, ugly, and just plain insane. If the show made her wild outbursts funny or treated her with some sort of humility, she might\'ve been a fun character. But no. Instead, she\'s the most obnoxious robot I\'ve seen in an anime since the Ropponmatsu androids in Excel Saga. And like them, this robot, as well as this anime, needs to be scrapped.

Iketeru Futari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/637/Iketeru_Futari,"[""A hilarious Romantic/Comedy with plenty of fanservice. Here you'll find that Saji is the most perverted character in Anime existence. ^_^This anime follows Saji's struggles, to be liked by the mysteriously cute girl, Koizumi. There isn't much to say about this short anime because there barely is a storyline it follows, just a series of random events with some character development thrown in. Just like any other romantic comedy you get the classic moments however as an ecchi anime and a very exXxtreme one at that, so you'll find a lot of funny $exual moments too. One thing I can say is that this...has to be the most ecchi anime I've ever seen, definitely not one to watch around your parents.This was very fun to watch at times, but the fact that each episode is only 5 and a half minutes long, is good and bad in a way. The good thing was that I could watch it whilst downloading the main animes that I wanted to watch, but this bad because I could easily finish this anime and each episode left me unsatisfied. At least it made use of the time it had although I felt it could have done better if it was at least 10 minutes long.The animation quality was just appalling, with terrible character models, especially the big-breasted girl XD. But I didn't really expect it to be any better than it already was. The music was pretty much non-existent but what made up for it was Koizumi's funny but cute moans (when her pager vibrates). ^_^To summarize, this was an okay show at best and no matter how funny it was, it couldn't hide the fact that it had a stupid plot and barely a storyline. The ending for the show has to be the worst part. The show ended with such an opening ending that I didn't at all feel as though it was over. I really did get so confused by Koizumi, one minute she liked him and the next she didn't, &quot;Make Up Your Mind!&quot; The ecchi was funny but way overboard and I could barely go 20 seconds without watching something lewd or $exual. One thing is for sure and that is that Saji is the most perverted anime character ever created and I bet the creators are proud of that XD.All I can say is that I recommend this to anyone like me; someone who enjoys romantic comedies and needs something to watch while downloading another anime.

This is another one of those shows.  Personally, I love them, and this one is at the top of my favorites list.The story is a little hard to follow due to the fact that each episode is 5 1/2 minutes long (2 minutes are just ecchi scenes). It just focuses on the Koizume and Seiji.  Its a classic boy loves girl (obsessively) and girl doesn't want anything to do with boy (evident in the amount of...blood she leaves splattered on the walls).  The ecchi scenes are what makes it funny.  This dude knowingly puts himself in dangerous territory just for the sake of talking to this girl ( and taking a peek at the underwear of the day).

The perv, the mysterious girl, the bigbreasted childhood friend (who is only in 4 eps), and the mysterious girl's friends (who they dont really develop on).I just loved the ecchi scenes.  The violence and the perverted parts where just funny to me (i'm a little blood thirsty).I know my review might not help many people but please please, PLEASE watch this show. blood she leaves splattered on the walls).

Different types of episodes and a great anime in general, lets get on with the review.Story/Characters- There is the main character, who is a huge perv, and then there are a bunch of girls, who put a spin on it. I don't want to spoil anything, because honestly its not that big of a show, but it is a great story with twists around every corner. Same goes with the characters. That is why they both got nines.Art/Sound- The art and sound are good, as the voice acting and animation go. There really isn't much to say about that...though. Just generally good animation and sound were put into making this.Enjoyment- If you are a guy (Most girls wouldn't like this, for it is not a piece of shoujo crap), you will enjoy this. Some girl's might enjoy this, either if they are a man, or they aren't into extreme lovey-dovey shoujo crap. Lots and lots of man humor is in this and you guys will enjoy it.Overall- This is a great series for two reasons: One being that is well-rounded, for the animation and character development is done very well, and the sound and animation are ok. The second reason is that you can be very flexible when watch this show, considering you can watch this any time you are near a computer. THE EPISODES ARE 5 MINUTES LONG! You can virtually watch it whenever you want, or watch them all at once for an hour or so of enjoyment. That is why this deserves a nine. though.

What's even better, with its short episode length, even those who suffer from attention span issues can enjoy it to the fullest. Aside from not being completed, the only other downside this anime has is the animation quality, however, it's not really an issue...and won't hinder the delight one is provided with while watching this rare gem. and won't hinder the delight one is provided with while watching this rare gem."", '— shamelessly so. Practically every other episode begins with a sexual fantasy, there are detailed panty-shots galore, and plenty of bare breasts. If you like fanservice, then boy...you’re probably better off somewhere else. The anime also tries to have a bonafide story, and at only six minutes an episode, you can see where the problem lies. Given how much of the runtime comprises of Saji being a lecher and dumb jokes, attempts to be serious are laughable and jarring.The anime focuses on Koizumi, Rei Ayame’s slightly more emotive, dimensionally displaced twin sister. Her only notable traits are that she’s diminutive in size, mysterious, and...cagey. Why is she mysterious? Who knows? Who cares? The anime didn’t give me any answers, so I just rolled my eyes whenever her mysteriousness was brought up. It doesn’t help that said mysteriousness is stated, never shown.While Koizumi is boring, Saji is downright insufferable. He can barely function because if he’s not groping someone or staring at their panties, he’s having a sexual fantasy that he conflates with reality. The anime tried to push a romance, but it’s unbelievable thanks to the fact that Saji will get his rocks off to any woman.There are a few other recurring characters, but they might as well be cardboard boxes. There’s a love triangle with Saji’s childhood friend that ultimately goes nowhere, in case you wanted your time to be even more wasted.Character relations don’t make any sense. In the first episode, Koizumi has a fun night with Saji. Okay, fine. The problem is that the next day and for the rest of the series, she goes on hating him. If the anime was going to have Koizumi dislike Saji, it should have did away with their date at the beginning of the series. Koizumi’s feeling toward Saji flip flop so often that I was just left confused.The anime also tries to be comedic, but none of the jokes landed for me. The comedy amounts to Saji screaming (which I found obnoxious), Koizumi and other women beating the living crap out of Saji (which was justified, but not funny), and Saji making goofy faces (which still weren’t goofy enough to garner a laugh).Despite sex-appeal being this show’s biggest strength, it’s not even that good. The cel-shaded art automatically places this as an older anime, but the nostalgia stops there, because the art is pretty average, and at times just plain bad. The character designs aren’t too striking, which is practically a cardinal sin when making erotic animation. The only thing that would help is accented features, and for the most part, proportions are fairly plain in Iketeru Futari. Sure, there are times when the show is sexy, but those moments are few and far between.The last episode is a perfect example of the show’s faults. It’s a dramatic episode, but we don’t really know why the characters make the decisions that they do. It ultimately ends with character relationships back to square one, with nothing resolved. I guess I prefer that than the show trying to pretend it had dignity all this time.Iketeru Futari is a comedy that’s not funny, a romance that’s anything but romantic, and an ecchi that’s seldom sexy. If flounders in nearly every aspect. To add insult to injury, it’s just plain gross. The short runtime doesn’t make it more enjoyable; it makes it more bearable.5/10D- cagey. Why is she mysterious?

It is very effective in showing a lot of fan service but ultimately has a undeveloped plot. The plot has the potential to be ahead of it's time and very intriguing but it fails on most fronts to be compelling. It feals like there was something holding it back from being an above average anime. The animation is very dynamic and almost lively. It has a lot of energy but over all looks dated and poorly aged. Comparing to shows that came out around that time it looks slightly...above average. It a good watch it because your bored show not a watch it because it's good. It's might be worth a watch to experience some older ecchi anime.A remake of this anime would be very interesting in a modern anime world that is more open to certaint content. If it was redone now it could explore some of the subtext of the shows charter relations more in depth. above average. It a good watch it because your bored show not a watch it because it's good.

Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kira,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10491/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Kira,"[""This is likely the only review I will every write on this site, and it's going to be a fairly brief one. The reason for this is that people give this show way too much hate.First of all, anyone that watches Higurashi for the gore will not particularly like this OVA. But then again, Higurashi is in no way about the gore; it's about the characters and what they go through. And this fact is exactly why I am giving this an 8/10. Over the course of the series, we have all seen just how much suffering the characters have gone through. Don't you...think they need a reprieve? Do you really think they deserve to go through such hell and not live happy lives afterwards?Next, I've noticed that many of the hateful reviews of Kira are by people who have only seen the first episode. The first episode is pretty much the only episode with immense amounts of fanservice(other episodes only have minor fanservice in the fact that Shion's breasts occasionally Gainax), and that is the entire point of the episode. If you don't like fanservice, then simply skip episode 1. Episode 2 is a parody of the magical girl genre, and fulfills its job well.In my opinion, where this OVA really shines is in the third and fourth episodes. The third episode is a comedic side-story about Mion, Shion, and Rena all vying for Keiichi's love, and it manages to have that signature Higurashi comedy that we all know and love. I won't spoil the ending of the episode, but it elicited more than a few chuckles from me. Episode 4, unlike the other three, is a relatively serious one-shot mainly about Hanyuu and Rika. This episode is  considered canon to the series and is definitely worth a watch, even if you do not watch the rest of Kira. The ending even manages to nearly make my eyes water, and I am not one who cries easily.In short, this OVA is nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be(as long as you are a fan of Higurashi for the right reasons(such reasons being things such as the characters, the story, the comedy, the message it gives off, etc.)). I would highly suggest giving it a try, and even if you end up disliking the first episodes, go ahead and finishing it. You will not regret it, trust me. think they need a reprieve?

The art is good and theres noting really wrong with fan service but it's a major disappointment if you liked the original series and lacks any real conflict or plot. "", ""Ok, so the Commemoration of the infamous Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni's 10th Anniversary, DEEN gives us a Comedy and at the moment, It is rated...ok.On the Other hand. Type Moon is making a 10th Aniversary anime for the horror anime/LN Tsukihime and the Action Anime/LN Fate Stay Night. AND IT IS ALSO A COMEDY.Talk about Double Standards people. People Slam Higurashi kira for not being serious. Carnival Phantasm is just as Serious as Kira. Get over it. For the 10th Anniversaries of Studios and Famous Serious anime the Animation Companies decided to do something Lighthearted.So Why the Hate all on Kira? It is...essentially doing the same thing as Carnival Phantasm. They both have Injokes and have Comedic Versions of the Characters.Sure Kira is more Fanservice-y but then again, Higurashi wasn't an Eroge to begin with. People need to stop having double standards. The Art is Deen. The Characters are the same as if the first episode of arcs, before everything got serious happens. It is basically a break from all that is Serious. We have gotten Two long Series of Seriousness. Two Episodes of Relief and then a three episode serious arc. Fate Stay Night and Tsukihime have Two long serious Animes with now getting 14 episode of Relief (If you want to compare by 30 minutes then 7), which is more than Kira.Take a Break people. Relax and don't take anything seriously, if you are hating on Higurashi Kira and loving Carnival Phantasm, you have double standards.Oh yeah the Review. I liked it, it even parodied itself.(P.S. Sorry about all the mentions of Carnival Phantasm and anything Type:Moon. Just had to point it out on this Rant/Review) essentially doing the same thing as Carnival Phantasm.

I knew from the trailer that it was going to be bad but the whole thing turns out just to be an extended eroge sequence involving each of the main girls in turn.DEEN have an opportunity to make an OVA for Higurashi, one of my favourite series, and they make this... this... abomination. Maybe the three episode arc will be vaguely less disgusting but going off this first episode I don't even know why I should bother continuing to watch it.Rei had a similar thing with a silliness fun episode at the start but the...main difference is that while Rei's first episode is the fun times which are more reminiscent of the actual Higurashi series Kira's first ep is entirely dedicated to Keiichi and three minor characters (being totally OUT of character) just fantasising perverted things. I have a high tolerance for fanservice but I had to say Rika's rubbing of her bum on a window making ecchi noises really got to me, she's what - nine?Higurashi fans will probably watch this simply because it's Higurashi, so will I, but that doesn't mean you'll enjoy it. Frankly, it'd be better off not existing. main difference is that while Rei's first episode is the fun times which are more reminiscent of the actual Higurashi series Kira's first ep is entirely dedicated to Keiichi and three minor characters (being totally OUT of character) just fantasising perverted things.

Frankly, it'd be better off not existing."", ""Since there are a lot of conflicting viewpoints on this 4 episode OVA, I thought I would just clear things up for those of you who are trying to decide weather or not to watch it:First, let it be noted that there is no gore what so ever in the OVA; something that Higurashi is infamous for. However, if you were only watching Higurashi for its gore, then you were watching it for the wrong reasons, because it's not a show about mindless blood and gore. Higurashi is and has always been about the journey of the characters,the struggles they have had to go through,...and their friendship. People who understand that will enjoy SOME of this OVA, but certainly nobody will enjoy all of it.The majority of the hate that this OVA receives comes from people who saw the first episode and then simply refused to continue, and understandably so. Episode 1 of Higurashi Kira is complete and utter garbage that NOBODY should ever have to sit through. They turn the awesome characters of the Higurashi series into mindless vessels for SHAMELESS fan-service that serves no purpose to the true plot, has no side-plot of its own, and is just physically painful for a Higurashi fans to watch. Whatever you do, DON'T watch episode 1.Episode 2 is better then episode 1, but that's not saying much. It's a goofy, over the top, and downright silly parody of the magical girl genre with the Higurashi characters. If you really liked some of the more light-hearted moments of the series and wouldn't mind seeing another full episode dedicated to the writers and animators dicking around, then I suppose this one could be worth your time. It's still not what anybody wanted or expected out of a Higurashi OVA though.Episode 3 is where the OVA starts to redeem itself, with a very solid episode about the romantic/sexual tension in the club that has been present throughout the series, mostly between Mion and Keiichi, but Rena and Shion are involved as well. While I really do not like what they did with Shion in this episode, it is still worth watching as it's a nice change of pace to see the club members experience normal problems for once, and provides a bit of closure as far as the romantic feelings of the club members are concerned.Episode 4 is the true saving grace of the OVA and is definitely worth watching if you are a Higurashi fan. It's a heart-warming story about Rika and Hanyuu and really is just a delight to watch; that's all there is to say.Overall, Higurashi Kira is worth watching for episodes 3 and 4 alone, as true fans of the series will take great pleasure in watching them. Maybe I could recommend episode 2, but holy mother god, words can not describe how horrible episode 1 is. DON'T watch it, but if you do anyway, don't let it turn you off to the rest of the OVA. and their friendship.

Aside from the usual comic relief, this time there was further emphasis on fan-service, mainly seen during the first episode. In today\'s  market it isn\'t surprising to see such content surface in the Higurashi-franchise, though evidently many Higurashi fans don\'t quite fit in the moe-loving masses, targeted by said content.In short, if the intriguing story or the splatter-filled scenes from the original work are what you\'re after, you\'ll have to look elsewhere. But if you wish...to take a further look at the peaceful and comic side of Hinamizawa and the lives of our original characters, this OVA is probably worth your time.To make this review just a bit review-like, I\'d like to say something about the actual properties in regard to which I was supposed to rate this OVA. 3 out 4 episodes can be considered pure comic relief, so the story exists mainly to make you laugh - a fait accompli, at least in my case. The final episode differs from the rest in this aspect, and has a slightly more meaningful plot, taking a little peak at the past of one of the characters. The art-style, animation and soundtrack  are all satisfying at the least, given the genre. Characters are the same as in the previous works, though this time around we get to see more of their comical, playful and ordinary sides.I myself enjoyed this piece, and in my opinion it provides a fitting sort of a continuation to the way things ended in Matsuribayashi-hen. It\'s nice to see how Rika and company get to finally enjoy a normal everyday life, after experiencing a hundred or so years of recurring death and violence.Do recommend for all those wishing to see more of the ""ordinary"", serene Hinamizawa, or simply have a good laugh. to take a further look at the peaceful and comic side of Hinamizawa and the lives of our original characters, this OVA is probably worth your time.To make this review just a bit review-like, I\'d like to say something about the actual properties in regard to which I was supposed to rate this OVA. 3 out 4 episodes can be considered pure comic relief, so the story exists mainly to make you laugh - a fait accompli, at least in my case.

Many people want the mysterious and twisted stories back with this, but instead they get some fan service. What do i say about it? Well since it\'s just an OVA, you can obviously not expect Anything storylike in it, which many people don\'t seem to understand (OVAs like Hellsing are rare okay, you don\'t really get story filled OVAs). More than 80% of OVAs are just for fan service, if you haven\'t known.. I know it may have seemed like it tainted the killer loli character, but some of us like to see them...fooling around for once. If you don\'t want to see that then well, just don\'t watch this.Alright now for the review. It actually has that higurashi feel to it, so it\'s not complete BS. K and the Soul Brothers are here(returning from Rei) and while Kei is complaining about losing those punishment games, the Soul Brothers! encourage him into winning and they imagine all these kind\'ve of things if they win with each female character(Takano Miyo was my favorite;D).The animation is the best out of all the series and the imaginations they have are just funny as hell.I am a little disappointed in how Eiko Shimamiya hasn\'t sung the Op, but I guess she can\'t do every one. Right, the Op and Ed are really different compared to Rei in the more happy, joyful way so... well yeah thats that ( I honestly liked the others better).But all in all, i thought this was pretty decent and can\'t wait to see what embarassing situations they have ready to show us next.[Ep 2 Edit]Ummm, alriight... the 2nd ep has what all the 1st ep haters were screaming for, No Fanservice! Just a complete mess really. So they killed the fanservice and turned it into a elementary school magical girl story. And well it just sucked.  It starts out with Rika and Satoko dreaming and landing in another world. Then ""Tokyo Magika"" wreaks havoc on Hinamizawa and a foggy mist which confuses everyone besides those two makes everyone crazy and delusional. Rika and Satoko somehow deal with that and then what? A Giant Monster appears and its mahou shoujo Rika time! How original!(Well it wasn\'t as if i was expecting something original from that story)  Not interesting at all and it makes you feel like you just wasted 30 precious minutes of your life.(Nope, there are no hot Takano Miyo scenes in this one...I actually think it ruined her image.)I Highly suggest you Skip this one, but continue on watching the others.It looks like all of them will be a certain kind of genre, 1st was Fanservice, 2nd was Mahou Shoujo, and now the 3rd one will be romance. Yes finally! All the Keiichi and Mion couple lovers will have their dreams come true!! Or will it be with Shion? Who knows, we\'ll have to wait \'till the 3rd OVA comes out. fooling around for once.

Of course, Kira has just started, and ohoho there\'s still more to judge.Story - 8Although it\'s basically unrelated to happenings of the actual - at the lack of a better term -  ""timeline"" to Higurashi no naku Koro ni, it gives a fun and comedic spin off. Some may not like this because they want more questions answered, and honestly, I think they all were (play the game!). I must admit that...I do miss some of those mysteries, but it\'s time for some fun. At some parts you\'ll laugh until you are lacking in air, at least I did. This ojii-chan is not a big ecchi fan as well, but to this I proudly say ""nipaー☆"".Art - 10Auuu~ DEFINITELY improved. Kai made it better especially, but with nowadays technology and animation skills - kanpeki na no desu!Sound - 10Soundtrack, amazing as always, adding a nice touch to the comedic tragedy of Keiichi\'s failure of a life and everything else. Voice actors, of course, very fitting as usual. Opening and ending, a great twist the the usual ""kowai""-ness, giving us some ""kawaii"". Plus, Happy! Lucky! Dochy! is way too catchy.Characters - 10I must say this must be the one of the only series I\'ve seen in which I love almost all the characters (Ooishi, go die.).

I will say first that this story is not a creation of Studio DEEN but actually a creation by Ryukushi07 himself. This is a simpler anime then the others and allows laughs and TONS OF FANSERVICE. If you are a true fan of higurashi who loves the show for its story and not its violence you may enjoy this funny OVA.

Although, continue watching. Each episode, it gets better. The ending episode, and the episode before that, are extremely awesome. Any Higurashi fan should watch this, even with the horrible first episode. The animation quality is high, and the sound quality is too. The opening theme song is a little odd, considering the other three openings were much darker, but, it's sort of a nice change of pace. Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kira! "", ""Around 4 years ago I was one of those people who watched the 1st episode of Kira, gave it a rating of 2 and wrote a review bashing it immensely. Feeling nostalgic lately I've decided to re-watch and complete the series, coming to the realisation that Kira is actually a very fitting conclusion to the Higurashi saga.While the 1st episode still aims to deliver more fanservice than an avid fan of this series would ever expect to see, it still does so in that creepy mysterious Higurashi way. Many would argue still that it is not the best way to start off a new instalment...of a series that mainly focused on drama and the horrific hardships of its characters. However, all of it is done with Higurashi's creepy aura intact and makes perfect sense. It is not as bad as a lot of people (myself included) made it out to be at the time of its release.Likewise the second episode, though wacky, never derails from Higurashi's main themes. Parallel worlds, mystical fogs that turn Hinamizawa's inhabitants into murderous lunatics etc. It's still all here, albeit under a different packaging.However the third and fourth episodes are the real highlight of Kira and in my opinion constitute what I'd consider to be one of the best endings to an anime saga ever made.The third episode touches upon something that we've all known existed since Higurashi's ancient times. The immense sexual tension between Keiichi, the twins and Rena. To have an entire Higurashi episode focused on that aspect alone is a godsend because while present, that sexual tension was never acknowledged by the characters in all the previous series. Now, with the curse broken and Hinamizawa saved, Keiichi and the girls can't dance around the issue any more. It's a hot summer, both parties are really thirsty and it's time to make something happen. Hilarity ensues.If I was to rate each episode individually, the fourth one would deserve a 10. It is truly a heart-warming conclusion to everything that has happened in Higurashi since the beginning. The episode focuses on the bond between Rika and Hanyuu with a very nostalgic and emotional twist. It's hard to describe it without spoiling the plot but what I can say is that it will take the viewer to the very beginning and back again, rewarding them for having made it this far in the series. You've watched all the horrific suffering the characters go through in Higurashi to uncover the truth and this is the episode that will make you smile and release a sigh of relief.As for art and sound, they remain unchanged from all the previous releases. Same style, though the quality may have improved a little. Same VAs, same music straight from Higurashi's OST so you feel at home. Same old Higurashi.All things considered, Kira is a very good follow up to Higurashi Rei and in fact the whole saga. The first two episodes might not be the serious Higurashi we know but then again, the main story arc has ended so they don't have to be. They're a decent break from all the batshit crazy stuff that usually went down in the past. Episode 3 is what we've all wanted to see at some point and 4 is a masterful conclusion to the series.Kira is a must watch for any Higurashi fan.Thanks for reading.8 points. of a series that mainly focused on drama and the horrific hardships of its characters.

It's a hot summer, both parties are really thirsty and it's time to make something happen. Hilarity ensues.If I was to rate each episode individually, the fourth one would deserve a 10. It is truly a heart-warming conclusion to everything that has happened in Higurashi since the beginning. The episode focuses on the bond between Rika and Hanyuu with a very nostalgic and emotional twist. It's hard to describe it without spoiling the plot but what I can say is that it will take the viewer to the very beginning and back again, rewarding them for having made it this far in the series. You've watched all the horrific suffering the characters go through in Higurashi to uncover the truth and this is the episode that will make you smile and release a sigh of relief.As for art and sound, they remain unchanged from all the previous releases. Same style, though the quality may have improved a little. Same VAs, same music straight from Higurashi's OST so you feel at home. Same old Higurashi.All things considered, Kira is a very good follow up to Higurashi Rei and in fact the whole saga. The first two episodes might not be the serious Higurashi we know but then again, the main story arc has ended so they don't have to be. They're a decent break from all the batshit crazy stuff that usually went down in the past. Episode 3 is what we've all wanted to see at some point and 4 is a masterful conclusion to the series.Kira is a must watch for any Higurashi fan.Thanks for reading.8 points."", 'Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kira. What a disaster.This is an OVA to the popular and thoroughly enjoyable Higurashi anime series. I was utterly disappointed with Kira. Nothing in Kira even remotely made any sense and it seems to be just full of fan-service and parodies of the original Higurashi series. Now don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against fan-service. I welcome them with open arms as long as they make the anime more interesting. But in Kira, it is completely disgusting and it adds no value to the Higurashi series and in fact insulted each of the lovely cast.Seriously, this anime is as...bad as having gay scenes mixed together with magical girls. I know what you are saying. “WTF that was completely unnecessary and this is just an exaggeration to defame the anime. Now I can’t get the image out of my mind. Screw you!”. Well actually, Kira DOES have a gay scene and transforming mahou shoujos battling bad guys.Yes, this is true, stop rechecking to see if you have read wrongly.Now lets revise the plot (lol*) of each episode shall we? No this is not considered ‘SPOILERS’ because you are never going to have to waste precious seconds of your life to watch this piece of sh*t.Episode One: Protagonist Keiichi contracts the ‘true Hinamizawa syndrome’ and becomes a delusional pervert. Mion fires a friggin’ AK-47 almost point blank at him and all six billion shots misses. He successfully escapes. Thankfully, Keiichi, who we at this point have no idea whether he’s in a delusion or not, finds himself in a classroom alone with three middle-aged men who smiles evilly as they corner Keiichi and closes in on him. Keiichi screams. The episode finishes. It won’t take an Einstein to theorize what had happenned to Keiichi. However, the million-dollar question is: Will Keiichi survive the gang rape? Well, I guess we’ll find out in Episode Two, wont we?Episode Two: Nope! Apparently this whole chapter is about two lovely little girls transforming into magical girls to save their friends as they battle a gay giant nail-ripper monster. Gee, this completely ruined the heart-wrenching moment when Shion was forced to pull out three of her nails to save the one she loves earlier in the Higurashi series. What was meant to be one of the most iconic moments of the Higurashi anime to represent the sacrificial spirit of the character was crushed, diced, and flushed down the toilet along with the other crap.I guess the producers thought that the fans will be satisfied with scantily-clad little girls, nurse and teacher as well as the gay scene for the 10th anniversary commemoration of Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. “Fans good! Fan-service good! We give good fans good fan-service! We good!” And then the director goes >:0 WHOA THIS IS THE BEST FRIGGIN’ IDEA EVER FOR A 10th ANNIVERSARY! LET’S DO IT !Here’s a slight rundown.

It's not horror, it's not scary, it's shoujo, and highly pervert.This series made me sick. They turned Keichi into a sick pervert who imagine all the girls doing really degrading punishment games, like cleaning windows with their butt.And Rika chan and Satoko chan as magical girls? Excuse me but I have to throw up.If you gonna watch it, just remember, I warned you. "", ""Not...As...Bad...As...Everyone...Says...It...Is...The only reason that I gave this any form of 1 was because it had no story.As the writer of the original series said. You need to put in some comedy with the depressing and disturbing stuff. It keeps the viewers attention. And with a new disturbing arc and a few more seasons covering the other outcomes that the player of the games could have gotten.I really enjoyed this arc. Even though it doesn't take the same disturbing feeling of the other three seasons. It felt good to have it here. And how could you people not expect Ryukishi07 to put this into action. "", ""All I'm seeing is scathing reviews. Especially the first episode which people think is absolutely stupid. Just to let people know that particular episode is adapted from the actual visual novel. Dang. It's a fan service OVA. Just watch it for what it is. There really isn't any story left to be made. If they tried it'd probably be far worse than this. The characters are back and are just as lovable. Honestly I'm glad that after 10 years they made anything at all. If you're a fan then I hope you will enjoy it. I'm a fan and I found this OVA to be...absolutely hilarious and adorable.As a side note the previews for the last OVA file look to be more serious and explore Rika's past with Hanyu. absolutely hilarious and adorable.As a side note the previews for the last OVA file look to be more serious and explore Rika's past with Hanyu."", 'While it is true that Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kira is far more light-hearted than any of the other installments, with the exception of the second episode, (which I just think of as Hanyu screwing with Rika’s dreams like she has been known to do) they all fit perfectly well with the Higurashi world built through Ni, Kai and the first OAV. Even the second episode still had the same feeling as the others and it was nice to see the two boys finally get some screen time together.The series of disasters have ended, Rika and everyone else is safe. I think they’ve...earned some fun! I would strongly suggest watching the first OAV before watching this or you will be lost during the first episode. Also, please remember that even Higurashi Ni had some fan-service moments. By no means will the viewer be constantly bombarded with images of bouncing boobs. I only counted less than ten for the entire four episodes. The biggest (no pun intended) offender was Shion.If you enjoy bouncing back and forth between genres like I do, if you enjoy the occasional harem anime (as long as the fan-service isn’t crazy gratuitous), and if you are not a complete purist, you will enjoy this anime. Just take it in the spirit it was intended… a fun watch. This probably won’t be your favorite anime,  and if you think harem animes are horrible, if you only stick to one genre, and if you want to see an anime where everyone has a fun time then someone dies, go re-watch the first or second season.This installment of Higurashi is much more episodic than any of the others. None of them have anything to do with the previous episode. However, they each tell a story. The best story-telling episode (and the least humorous) was the fourth one. Except for the first episode (which was funny but I really couldn’t tell what the heck was going on), each episode had a different story to tell and told it rather well I thought.The art was a little more “cutsie” than some of the other Higurashi installments and I did have a few problems with one of the characters from the fourth episode, but all in all, it was standard Deen art, absolutely beautiful. I loved how clean the lines were in this one!The sound fit the anime quite well. The opening and ending songs were VASTLY different from any other Higurashi, but, then again, so was this installment! Both songs were catchy and I can’t get the opening song out of my head! I loved the piano music that came in at certain points and the sound was certainly up to Higurashi standards.The main characters haven’t changed one bit. Keiichi is still a perverted dependable guy (lol), Rena and Rika are the same, Mion and Shion don’t change. If you haven’t watched the first OAV you will not get the conduct of the Chief Inspector, Irea, and the photographer that I am not looking up a name for. The grandmother gets a truly adorable part that had me almost crying with laughter.I truly enjoyed this anime. Just don’t start watching this expecting classic Higurashi.

I know a lot of people are saying that they don't appreciate the 'magical girl' or 'mecha' storyline but I felt it was a very...clever parody of the world that Rika was used to fighting in.The reason I enjoyed this episode so much was just little things more than anything. Mostly how tiresome 'alternate' Rika found it all and of course, the usual suspects being the 'masterminds' (Takano, I'm looking at you).Of course, I can't give it any more than a 4 since my absolute adoration of the original Higurashi seasons would not allow me.

There seems to be sea of angry reviewers patrolling Kira around the clock. Simply put, don\'t get into a 4 episode OVA expecting a vivid and meaningful addition to a franchise\'s story - now that\'s one to write down if you can\'t remember.Higurashi is a franchise that i simply adore - Ni Kai making its way to my #3 spot...The mystery, the depth, immersion, horror, and the unexpected twists allowed me to become enveloped in a story far exceeding my expectations.Kira is quite the contrast, as for the most part: it covers a much more controversial, playful and nonsensical aspect...of life in Hinamizawa.It\'s downright dumb to criticize this OVA for being unlike the rest of the Higurashi\'s animeography - as this is quite clearly the point.*Actual Review*It doesn\'t take long for anyone to realize that Yes, Kira is dumb. It\'s shallow for the most part. It bears no real relevance to the rest of the story. It\'s full of fanservice. The episodes don\'t connect.

The polar opposite of Higurashi\'s reputation as a psychological horror fest.""How ironic, how refreshing"" I personally say...From a technical standpoint, as opposed to a personal one, i\'m basically forced to kick Kira down to around 5 or 6 to conform to my normal style, and make MAL\'s rigid rating structure work for me - because the stories would technically require a lot more elaboration to function even remotely well alongside Ni and Ni Kai, the soundtrack is generic, the characters are expanded upon - a bit, but only in the concluding episode, and it obviously didn\'t carry that big blockbuster impact; prominent in  the show\'s previous seasons...BUT THAT\'S ENOUGH NEGATIVITY!Contrary to my previous points; i\'m going to snap out of robot reviewer mode (a lot of people seem to forget how to do this), and say that Kira was actually a pleasure to watch.Alike every other Higurashi fan, prior to watching Kira, the show has always been shrouded in a mist of ""seriousness"", and a brilliant though ""weighty"" atmosphere that lead me to doubt that there would ever be a pure, happy and silly part to the show or the characters - without SOMETHING looming just ahead.For me, Kira put these doubts to rest, and i can appreciate the creator\'s intentions to bring forth a much more lighthearted array of aspects to the show - though i must say that fanservice is never really called for...I laughed, a lot. The complete lack of belonging in this ""mini-series"" compared to the rest of the show never ceased to amuse me. Watching Kira is like watching the result of the directors uncut, wild ideas and thoughts - though instead of him cooping them up and keeping Higurashi under that reputable curtain of ""seriousness"" (i dislike that word), the animator, and all of the voice actors are actually standing right behind him, insisting that they do it anyway ""for a laugh"", ""a little, completely unrelated tribute"" - and that\'s exactly what Kira became.It\'s a change of pace, and as an OVA, it\'s most definitely NOT to be taken deadly seriously.Kira brings forth a refreshing, though arguably unorthodox side to Higurashi for the most part.Think of it as the complimentary mint to your exquisite main course that is Ni and Ni Kai - you can choose to take it or leave it, because it\'s really only exists to appease your curiosity as to ""what would Higurashi be like if there was no death?"".

Some are good and some bad, so I'll give my brief thoughts on each.The first OVA is pretty funny, but it starts to drag on after a while.

I would only watch this to say that you completed the pack of OVAs.The third OVA is somewhat romantic and funny. It should be able to keep...your interest throughout.The fourth OVA is a must watch! It is cute, sad, and mysterious, and it really helps you appreciate all the other Higurashi you've seen!If I was rating just the fourth OVA I'd give it an 8, 9, or 10. your interest throughout.The fourth OVA is a must watch!

However I feel the need to write this review since the top-rated negative reviews seem to be highly-misinformed on the history of how Studio Deen ""created"" this ""abomination"" which has spawned such negative reception since it first aired.Batsukoishi-hen, the first arc introduced to us in the Kira ova was actually the first arc to appear in the Rei visual novel. Before it became a part of Rei it was originally written as an ""epilogue"" to Meakashi-hen( aka the Shion arc. ) but Ryukishi07  decided to add it...to the Rei VN instead. The first arc in the Rei anime was replaced by Hajisarashi-hen ( an arc based on a light novel that came with one of the games ) and Batsukoishi-hen was never actually supposed to be animated...but then Kira happened.There, I said it. Yes, you heard all of that right. The original author of the series wrote this arc himself. Deen just happened to be the studio in charge of animating it. And if you don\'t believe me you can go and look it up for yourself.  So if you\'re going to blame anyone for placing the main characters of Higurashi into such an atrocious piece of shit blame Ryukishi himself.Let us at least be thankful that this arc didn\'t remain the epilogue to the most famous arc in the entire series.That aside, is the Kira ova really as bad as people make it out to be?We can all agree that the first episode is shit. Lolicon, incest, sexualization of nearly the entire cast of the series...you\'ve got it all. But if you skip over the first episode and look at the remaining three they\'re hardly comparable when it comes to perverted fanservice.The next 3 episodes are completely original content but were also still written by Ryukishi himself. So if you still think that they\'re bad even after knowing that fact, please don\'t place all the blame on Deen for the quality of the content. After all, they did a much better job with the animation this time around.The magical girl episode is cute and charming. Episode 3 also isn\'t that bad. The whole love triangle thing may be pretty typical of harem anime but higurashi never was a harem anime and no part of this particular scenario is actually meant to be taken seriously. This ova is purely for fun and episodes 2 and 3 are merely meant to be cute, silly and funny. It may not be everyone\'s cup of tea but that doesn\'t make it horrible. It\'s not supposed to be taken seriously and alot of people hate on it purely for the fact that there\'s no blood being spilled. Sure it\'s not the traditional higurashi style of ""cute girls committing gruesome crimes"" but that\'s not even at the heart of what the original series was trying to portray.The last episode is where this ova truly shines though. We get a heartwarming look into Hanyuu\'s  relationship with Rika and it\'s very cute, sweet, and beautiful to watch. Even if you aren\'t into the type of humor the previous two episodes try to pull off, this episode is genuine and if anything I think this should be an episode that any fan of the series gets around to seeing eventually.All of that said, even if you hate the first episode of Kira the next three episodes deserve at least a try. And if you still don\'t like them that\'s absolutely fine. But they\'re certainly not as awful as the first episode and aren\'t even really that ""bad"" to begin with. to the Rei VN instead.

I\'ve given  the group of them 8/10 as a kind of average for all of them.The first episode is exclusively fanservice and in a cheap way. Nearly every OVA in anime contains some form of fanservice, but this is just offensive. There is an ungodly weak ""plot"" that simply functions as a fanservice engine. This ""plot"" allows the animators to just lump in a bunch of random fanservice scenes together and call it an episode. If you\'re looking for Rule 34, then this is the episode to watch, if not skip it altogether. 2/10The second...episode is a bit better. The plot seems like something from a fan-fic crossover story, but that isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. It\'s silly and fun with some funny moments. 7/10The third episode is typical for a good OVA. It definitely has fanservice, but that isn\'t the primary point of it. The plot develops character relationships that were brought up in the main story and they are handled in a way that would be typical of the characters. It was a funny episode with great character interactions.  8.5/10The fourth episode was phenomenal. It can very easily be considered an epilogue to the main series and a great one at that. There are a lot of cute, funny moments mixed in with some  emotional scenes and an overall good plot.

First off at least they didn\'t change too much stuff up. I guess I can understand why people HATE this OVA series because it lacks the ""killing"" sensation of the horror of the anime. Maybe they decided to let it go with a more fun relaxing part of it. Don\'t get why people call it ""eroge"" since its not hentai. Ecchi? Yes. But it was ecchi before people just didn\'t realize it. I don\'t think it was HORRIBLE but I think they could have done better at least. I lasted through it so I survived. ', ""This OVA was supposed to be taken lightly and it use to be scary and tragic but now everyone's just happy together more. I think that the first episode was mainly focused on their funny and perverted minds kind of like the first episode in Rei. I still love the series and I know that the whole meaning was to show how you would live a happier life by being with your friends and staying happy. I think that a true Higurashi fan would still cherish the series despite the new OVA fanservice might not seem that good to them. "", ""Oh Kira, Kira, Kira...what an infamous entry to the Higurashi series it is...and not for the reasons you think Higurashi is infamous for...If my profile didn't make it clear, the Higurashi series is one of my fav anime series of all time. I love its characters, story, the psychological horror aspect to it, etc. I'm sure that the VN and mangas will most likely be better. When this anime first came out, I was willing to give it a change. Even though the franchise is recognizable for its scares, blood and gore, it wasn't really the core of Higurashi in my book. It was the...characters and the close friendship that they grew to have with each other. It also had plenty of light-hearted moments too so a fun little OVA can't hurt, right?....RIGHT?The 1st episode is AWFUL. It is nothing but shameless fanservice. It relegates all the guys into mindless perverts and treats the girls like sex objects. The fact that characters like Satoko and Rika (11-12 YEAR OLDS, MIND YOU) are involved in fanservice is REALLY gross. Though, all the girls (besides Miyo and Chie) are under 18, so it's still really uncomfortable for me. Even if you SOMEHOW choose to ignore that, it's still very unfunny and dumb in a bad way. Don't watch it please.The 2nd episode is stupidly fun for me. It's a very silly, over the top parody of magical girl shows and it focuses on Rika and Satoko being magical girls, with Hanyuu fulfilling the small companion role. I do like magical girl shows so this one was enjoyable for me.The 3rd episode is pretty boring since I did NOT care for the love square plot and the Keimion tease. (Though, that's probably just me being biased since I prefer KeiRena...). Also, I didn't like Shion being involved since she already loves someone else (to the point of finding differences between Keiichi and Satoshi) and that was a core aspect of her character.Episode 4 is a really cute plot about Hanyuu and a younger Rika. It's a good way to end the show and is the main episode that salvages this show. This is what I wanted more out of from Kira, but sadly, it's only in this (though 3 may count, to be fair...)For the art, I like it. It's not the best that Higurashi has offered in my eyes, but it's pretty colorful, rather detailed, and shiny, which goes well with a show like this.As for sound, I like the cheerful opening and ending songs, but I do prefer the other openings and endings. The cast and sound department do a good job as usual, but nothing too special.I can't really say I recommend this show since it is VERY cringy in some areas, but passable in others. If you DO want to watch it though, I recommend watching 2 and 4, and if you're a sucker for romance, harems, and/or Keimion, MAYBE 3. If you plan on watching the 1st episode for whatever reason...don't say I didn't warn you.Final Rating: 5-5.5 characters and the close friendship that they grew to have with each other.

It has some fan-service here and there while also having a unique story of its own. It's around the same level of quality as Rei is.The fan-service is kind of...weird...? Like, the girls are all very little and seeing some of them being portrayed the way they were is a little bit uncomfortable (though I did enjoy the 'Yaoi' scene that I won't spoil.) Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's just kinda...creepy.The story (at least for the 4th episode) was pretty cute even if it felt a little overwhelming having ANOTHER character...in the mix, even if it's only for one episode. I liked the moments between them and Hanyuu. The other episodes (asides from the...weird first episode) have alright stories for them just being one-off episodes.Songs again are used from the series' soundtrack, the songs are good though. The opening and ending match the tone of the show well, being energetic and brightly animated.Speaking of the animation, it looks good. A lot brighter to fit the mood of the  show and its happier tone. The fight scenes are actually nicely animated as well (in the case of the magical girl episode, which was probably my favorite episode of the series asides from the final episode.)Characters are...all over the place. When the fan-service moments are going on, they act WAAAAY out of character (in the case of basically ALL of the adult dudes), other than that, we really don't see the supporting characters all that much after that after Episode 3. The kids all act like normal though, so at least they aren't really changed that much (asides from Keiichi in Episode 1, where he was kinda forced into doing so, but I don't really count that.)Overall...not terrible, not great. Just, ok. If you want some Higurashi fan-service with the girls and whatnot, you'll like this. Otherwise, it's not really something you'll probably want to watch if you're looking for a complex story. I'd say just skip the final episode and just watch that in your case. I thought it was...ok, I guess. in the mix, even if it's only for one episode. I liked the moments between them and Hanyuu.

Thats all.So if you really liked higurashi you should watch it, its going to make you happy to see the characters in...a good situation, but if you don´t and especially if you can´t stand fanservice do NOT watch it.I personally liked it a lot, and also, what a nice opening omfg! a good situation, but if you don´t and especially if you can´t stand fanservice do NOT watch it.I personally liked it a lot, and also, what a nice opening omfg!', 'tl;dr: A comedy focused spin off of Higurashi that has really solid comedy and a really sweet and well made ending.Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kira is similar to Rei in that it has episodes that are just random nonsense that aren’t connected to the main plot as well as those that are connected and serve as somewhat of an epilogue. Kira is different from Rei though, in that while Rei was weighted more towards being an epilogue, Kira is weighted more towards random nonsense.The first three episodes of Kira are primarily centered around comedy. The first mainly involves a series of random delusions Keiichi...has about the rest of the female cast. The second involves Rika turning into a magical girl. The third involves sudden harem hijinks with between Keiichi and Mion, Shion, and Rena.The first two of these were completely absurd to the point of clearly being parody and clearly not being canon. I found the humor in these episodes pretty solid, the absurdity of it happening with the cast from Higurashi making it stand out a bit compared to just standard absurd comedy. I also found how many references they put to the main story and how well those references worked for comedic purposes pretty impressive. A lot were pretty subtle, the type that if you’re not watching not long after the main seasons you’d probably miss.The third episode isn’t as absurd or as comedic, with it being more down to Earth and is mostly within the realm of believability outside of how they kind of threw Shion in there as interested in Keiichi as well despite that concept having disappeared long ago during Shion’s answer arc in the first season. Still, I found the fluff amusing enough. All in all there wasn’t any point or depth to these episodes but they were pretty enjoyable for what they were.The last episode is the one with substance. It takes place after the end of the main story, though I suppose whether it takes place after after Rei or not isn’t exactly clear as both are essentially epilogue like side stories. It doesn’t have that much depth and doesn’t seem to be trying to convey anything major. Still, it’s incredibly sweet and really adorable. It’s centered around further developing the bond between Rika and Hanyuu and especially developing how it grew to what it is now. It also showed how Rika was before she went through the gauntlet so to speak, the contrast of which was also pretty interesting and enjoyable to see.I feel I should also note while the first two episodes were solid in terms of production values, being about at the level of Rei on average in terms of art, animation, and soundtrack, the final episode was a major step above that. The art, especially the backgrounds were great and looked genuinely beautiful at times, the animation was great, and the soundtrack fit incredibly well.The OP is very different both in visuals and audio from all the other Higurashi with how upbeat it is, but fits pretty well considering these episodes are mostly comedy. The same applies to the ED, though to a lesser extent. I should also note that each episodes ED is slightly different with each being sang by a different character with that character being slightly more focused on in the visuals as well, which mostly matched up to the characters focused on in the episode though not quite. has about the rest of the female cast.

I wouldn't suggest this to anyone unless you are specifically looking for more Higurashi/When They Cry content, this is just due to the way that these kind of fan service-y OVA's usually are (this is the 10th anniversary celebration[?]) One episode that is specially hard to get through is the first episode, which harder to stomach compared to literally all of the first and second season, while still being as strange as Rei (this isn't a compliment).And similar to my feelings on Rei, you can completely skip this and not miss out on anything, but it still has something for fans...of the last 3 seasons, so if you are going to watch this, just start from episode 2. It'll save you 30 very awkward and cringe minutes of your life. of the last 3 seasons, so if you are going to watch this, just start from episode 2. It'll save you 30 very awkward and cringe minutes of your life."", ""Warning possible SpoilersFanservice it can come in many different forms ranging from showing a character's private areas to developing a relationship between out favourite ships or just by giving us something that doesn't look like it would fit the anime, this decides to go all in with fanservice tropes.The OVA consists of 4 episodes with each of them doing something different.The first episode is where Keiichi is struggling in a game club match until the other male characters suddenly drop in to give him penalty ideas for the girls which end up being our Ecchi type fanservice until he realises it was a dream and...then it suddenly turns into a weird mess of random stuff where the girls just start going apesh*t on Keiichi, this episode was very uncomfortable at first and then confusing not a great combination to be honest unless the goal was to mindfu*k us.The second episode is where we see Rika and Satoko become magical girls to stop an evil organisation called Tokyo Magika which basically a silly version of the bad guys from the main series and I can't tell whether to say this is cute or not because we could all imagine Rika and Satoko pulling this off well, but I think it was supposed to be a shoutout to magical girl anime's from the 90's.The third episode which is probably my favourite is the shipping episode which is where we have a love triangle type situation between Mion, Rena and Shion trying to get Keiichi, now it is definitely shown in the main series that both Mion and Rena have some kind of attachment to Keiichi probably more Mion than Rena since it focuses more on Mion and Shion fighting this episode while Rena manages to sneak in, but the outcome of the episode was actually funny and unexpected then it showed something at the end which made me happy at least making me feel like Keiichi and Mion is the canon ship.The final episode is probably the most interesting since it felt the most like what When They Cry would do which involves a younger Rika somehow arriving into the future where her present self has broken the cycle where the others have to figure out how she got here, I liked this episode it had the mystery and complexity that I would usually get from the When They Cry series.Each episode was kind of a mixed reception since I liked some and thought some of the others were a bit weird and didn't fit, but there was definitely some entertainment here.Now there isn't much character development here since this a fanservice OVA so you're basically just going to see the characters messing around really, but the third episode does have some kind of development on a romantic level as we get to see how deep Keiichi's relationship goes with some of the female characters and how much they have grown on each other, then again going through a tremendous battle with you're friends would definitely make you closer in a way.When you compare the artstyle from the first series and then compare it to this there is a big difference especially with the character designs much like in the Third season OVA the characters do look a lot better, but since this is a fanservice OVA you can get away with whatever you put in and I have to say they went to some pretty high levels in some episodes especially the first and second episodes like the outfits the girls had to wear in the first episode which was probably the animators looking at fan art and seeing which fit the best while the magical girl episode just felt like a nostalgia trip for people who watched anime in the 90's.The whole point of this really is to parody certain things and to give the fans something they've been wanting these characters to experience that doesn't involve blood and guts which is definitely what it accomplishes and I thought it was ok because that first episode just didn't fit for me and that magical girl episode was just weird for some reason.Overall this was enjoyable in some places while unfitting in other areas, but for people who are fans of the show and want to see their favourite characters doing weird stuff that they probably imagined in the back of their head would definitely find some enjoyment here. then it suddenly turns into a weird mess of random stuff where the girls just start going apesh*t on Keiichi, this episode

Even still, I was mightily disappointed by the first episode alone which is nothing but unapologetically blatant fan-service. Episodes two and three were more of what I was expecting, but they still felt somewhat mediocre and pandering, mostly due to the bad taste episode one had left in my mouth. Episode four, however, is a saving grace. It brings back the charm of Hinamizawa, and the peace that has settled on the town since the events of the previous seasons....Episode four is a fantastic sendoff and farewell to a great series.Personally, I could have done without the first three episodes of Kira with the fourth being the only episode, but fans that have watched through the previous three seasons probably owe it to themselves to sit through it and watch all of them. If you are highly adverse to fan-service I recommend skipping the first episode. Trust me, you won't be missing out on anything by doing so. Episode four,however,  is a must for any fans that have made it this far.

But, this one let me down a bit. Rei was okay, this one wasn't too bad, but it was kind of bad. This is my reason for rating a 6.The story, well, it doesn't really have a story. Each episode is a different arc, with some comedy and stuff in it. I don't think any of them have remotely any horror or psychological scenes at all, but the reason I do like this one is because of the comedy.If you know who I am (nobody) then...you would know that I love comedy. I love anything to do with comedy, if it's anime, movies... and even pornography. I think I went to far there, but who cares! Comedy is awesome, my second favorite thing along with anime.The art, the graphics have extremely, tremendously, incredibly improved from the previous three seasons. Maybe they should reanimate the previous three seasons and have this type of animation in it. It would be good, though they'd never do it.The soundtrack hasn't really improved much from Rei. It has basically the same songs repeated from Rei, Kai and Ni. I'm just gonna refer to the first one as 'Ni' for now. So, that's why I haven't really given much thought to what I should rate it, so I just picked a random number that happened to be 6.Characters are pretty self explanatory. Pretty much the exact same from the previous seasons. But, not going to go to in depth about it, I'm just going to repeat the same things I've said in my other reviews. The characters are awesome, now, we're fuckin' moving on. Sorry for the language.I didn't remotely enjoy this as much as I did the other three seasons. But I have to admit it was actually quite good, considering how bad it was. Makes no sense, but go with it. It's good, but it's bad. It completely lacks on psychological scenes... and I fuckkkkinnnng love gore!! I'm completely obsessed with blood and gore. I sound fucked up, yes, but who's going to stop my reign?Overall, I give this a 6. Am I harsh? Or am I about right? I say anything below 4 is pure shit. Eh, but everyone has their own opinions, do they not? I'm not being too harsh, am I? 6 is actually fairly decent, considering what people actually give this anime. I've actually seen a 3 once, I think. I believe I've seen several ones below 4. But... come on... it's actually not that goddamn bad. I don't like it, but its actually quite fucking hilarious. Just, have fun again with your anime watching, peeps, and I'll see you in another completely random absurd anime review.Not to mention, the opening song is kinda shit. you would know that I love comedy.

Kyoukai Senki Part 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50678/Kyoukai_Senki_Part_2,"['Part 1 of Kyoukai Senki was agonizing to get through, and moved slower than a turtle in pacing. None of the characters seemed very likeable or properly developed, and the limited production values ruined it\'s commitment to 2D animation. The constant slideshows, and long dragging still frames that zoomed in and out during conversations felt very disappointing. The fights were not given any justice in how brutal they were supposed to look, and the lack of detail is frustrating. Between this starting and finishing, I also watched many of Tomino\'s Gundam series, from the original, Zeta, ZZ, and Char\'s Counterattack, to Victory Gundam. Kyoukai Senki...is a droplet of water compared to the ocean that any of those Gundam entries are in comparison to it. Gundam ruined it even more for me by giving me higher standards for a series of this genre. Even now with modern mecha, Megaton-kyuu Musashi, that rarely anyone bothered to watch, is significantly better, and is a series that I would recommend (second season is coming in Fall 2022).Kyoukai Senki felt like a severely watered down war story where the staff couldn\'t kill off any of it\'s main cast. Maybe it was an issue with risking being too dark. When a side character dies, the main cast get depressed each time and it\'s annoying. They could of at least done something such as in Victory Gundam where the feelings of loss are effectively and horrifyingly expressed, instead here it\'s constantly seeing Amou, Shion, and Gashin sit by a tree together looking as if someone stole their lunch money. Amou is the frustratingly emotional, delicate flower protagonist that I despise to see in anime like this. He would get killed immediately if he was in any Gundam series I\'ve seen. Anything this series tries to do fails in comparison to how Gundam did it. The music is forgettable.One of the biggest mistakes this series makes is that it reveals many of the characters motivations at the very end, and leaves them undeveloped and sort of behind the scenes throughout almost the entire series. This biggest fault here is their management of Brad\'s character. He rarely does anything, and is constantly smiling behind the scenes and acting as if he is two steps ahead of everyone else. I kept wondering, ""why is he like this?"" ""When is he going to actually do something instead of just smiling at monitors and people every episode?"" At the very end, they do explain what he was up to. The pay off felt great, but for all the wrong reasons.The story and politics are mostly elementary and not very interesting to talk about. The cast is fighting to restore Japan. That\'s it. As they go to war and try to win a revolution to gain it back, there\'s a lot of dirty politics going on between the factions. Ghost, who was the most interesting and amusing part of Part 1, is reduced to a toy for Brad, and doesn\'t go anywhere for almost the entirety of the second part. I would have liked to see if he was an AI like the ones the trio have. Their last ditch effort to have Ghost do anything at the end felt hollow. I much preferred how in Part 1, Ghost was this fearsome force with an AI that was constantly analyzing and countering it\'s enemies with it\'s high intelligence. They built up it\'s new form in this second season as something even more wicked, though the way Amou deals with it during their disappointingly anti-climactic final fight is just laughable.It\'s tragic that the episode that left the biggest impression on me is the plotless one where they had a birthday party for the AI. Up until that episode, the Pokémon rejects were annoying to me. It took me a long while to come to appreciate Gai. He felt like a convenient plot device and hack for Amou to help him win his battles.Of what I did enjoy, were mostly 4 characters. Brad, as pathetic as his execution as a character was for most of it, always remained the most interesting character because of what he was really up to in the war. Misuzu, their engineer, is the one who created the AI, and constantly struggles to come up with upgrades for their weapons. She\'s mostly glued to a computer and spends the rest of her time explaining. She still seemed likeable as the one who is in the lead of determining the overall technological advancement of the war. Lastly, the only dynamic and characters that I felt were the best ones for me came to be Shion and her AI, Nayuta. They have a fun dynamic where Nayuta is in love with her, and treats her as he is a servant and her a princess. Shion was nearly abandoned in part 1, and didn\'t really go anywhere in Part 2 besides being a supportive force to help Amou in battle. There\'s still a charm to her, as she is the only main character I could tolerate from the trio. Gashin is too annoyingly bitter, and felt like even more of a background character in Part 2.At least, the last 2 episodes bring some kind of redemption. Despite that they still overtly show it\'s problems as a series, they were intense and finally bring answers and closure to my headaches from all the previous episodes. Overall, this series was doomed from the start, and the ending was anti-climactic and as generic as they come. The slide show epilogue was very disappointing to see.

I much preferred how in Part 1, Ghost was this fearsome force with an AI that was constantly analyzing and countering it\'s enemies with it\'s high intelligence. They built up it\'s new form in this second season as something even more wicked, though the way Amou deals with it during their disappointingly anti-climactic final fight is just laughable.It\'s tragic that the episode that left the biggest impression on me is the plotless one where they had a birthday party for the AI. Up until that episode, the Pokémon rejects were annoying to me. It took me a long while to come to appreciate Gai. He felt like a convenient plot device and hack for Amou to help him win his battles.Of what I did enjoy, were mostly 4 characters. Brad, as pathetic as his execution as a character was for most of it, always remained the most interesting character because of what he was really up to in the war. Misuzu, their engineer, is the one who created the AI, and constantly struggles to come up with upgrades for their weapons. She\'s mostly glued to a computer and spends the rest of her time explaining. She still seemed likeable as the one who is in the lead of determining the overall technological advancement of the war. Lastly, the only dynamic and characters that I felt were the best ones for me came to be Shion and her AI, Nayuta. They have a fun dynamic where Nayuta is in love with her, and treats her as he is a servant and her a princess. Shion was nearly abandoned in part 1, and didn\'t really go anywhere in Part 2 besides being a supportive force to help Amou in battle. There\'s still a charm to her, as she is the only main character I could tolerate from the trio. Gashin is too annoyingly bitter, and felt like even more of a background character in Part 2.At least, the last 2 episodes bring some kind of redemption. Despite that they still overtly show it\'s problems as a series, they were intense and finally bring answers and closure to my headaches from all the previous episodes. Overall, this series was doomed from the start, and the ending was anti-climactic and as generic as they come. The slide show epilogue was very disappointing to see. As I said before, if you want to watch a modern mecha series that is out right now that is worth your time, go to Megaton-kyuu Musashi instead.', 'So, not long after Part 1\'s airing and release 6 months back in Fall, we\'re back again with Part 2 a.k.a the 2nd Split-Cour of Sunrise Beyond\'s new mecha series that I mentioned in my Part 1 review, was to continue being a cash-cow for more Bandai Gunpla merchandise amidst an overly-convoluted story that has too many elements working against each other. So with Part 2 being the continuation of the set-up that was for Part 1, how is the entire series in general of its complete 25-episode run? In a word: so-so.All I can say about Part 2, is that you should\'ve been caught...up with last Fall\'s 13-episode run that shows a futuristic post-war Japan being split and divided into different military factions, and this terrorist group Yatagarasu fighting for a liberated Japan that is back to its harmonious routes with this 16 year old boy Amou Shiiba finding an autonomous AI leading the charge. This is the understanding so far with Part 1, and Part 2 makes good on that premise by honouring the United Nations-like premise of the military finally having brains to converge together for an alliance, knowing intentions and aligning with enemies to forge a new Japan together, where only one large enemy remains in the way while still giving much more emphasis to the yet-untold behind-the-scenes story that adds more lore into the series as a whole. Mainly the creation of the AMAIM program, its creators and how they\'re side-swiped by the only big force (the NAC: North American Coalition) enough to plan ahead before progress got far, and that being reason enough for the smaller military forces to join hands with Yatagarasu and work together to once and for all, free Japan in a puppet state in disorientation. At least this feels like a much better and decent resolution for the build-up in Part 1 that was at times, unremarkable and un-noteworthy at best.I\'ve also complained about Amou\'s character development in Part 1 as a young adult whom has no backbone, and as you would expect, Part 2 vindicates his character growth through the explanation into his whole PTSD episode of reasoning. That, and which Amou has seemingly and dramatically ""come back from the dead"" in a solid fashion, is also telling of his once, cowardly behaviour that is also much improved. At most certainly, his character transformation is only done through plot, but since this is the 2nd part of the story, there needs to be a closure to his personal story that at the start, feels maligned to the point of a gone-case nut. The other characters do get significant improvements from their ambitions to everything surrounding their circumstances, but the sad case is that this is a self-contained story, and thus, also needs a resolution somehow. And although this isn\'t the best outcome, it\'s the best that they could\'ve done, and for that I respect the improvements made in aiding more character development, but that\'s just about the extent of a larger-than-life story that\'s meant to showcase much more.Reluctantly, it\'s clear that the split-part/cour format is the new trend going around in anime production to better weigh people against time, and making anime isn\'t as easy as you\'d think. It\'s obvious that the studio was given another 3 months to work things out to refine of what\'s left with the show before the Spring release, and that I\'d say was just the same as Part 1, so it\'s fine. I\'d think that Part 2\'s OST was a step down from Part 1, I\'d appreciate Yu-Na Fukinbara\'s Part 1 ED more than Part 2\'s OP for a decent song, all things considered. For the ED, Natumi.\'s ED song ""pARTs"" is nothing special, but some will identify that the music feels somewhat different, and that\'s because the song is composed by none other than SawanoHiroyuki, whom if you watched shows like 86, his background music is very telling of similar beats.All in all, Kyoukai Senki a.k.a AMAIM: Warrior at the Borderline as a series, my opinion still stands from the very beginning that it\'s the parent company Sunrise\'s efforts at branching off the Gundam franchise to find new ways to market more Gunpla, because of the company\'s strong connections to Bandai Spirits, and unfortunately there\'s no way around it. The entire show itself, you can take it or leave it, but in the end, it\'s just a farce of a marketing ploy that takes precedence over the show\'s quantity and quality to hide the fact that it\'s one BIG advertisement, and a mediocre attempt at that overall. Definitely not a good series and would be easily forgotten as when it first came. up with last Fall\'s 13-episode run that shows a futuristic post-war Japan being split and divided into different military factions, and this terrorist group Yatagarasu fighting for a liberated Japan that is back to its harmonious routes with this 16 year old boy Amou Shiiba finding an autonomous AI leading the charge.

I was not a big fan of the first season of this show, and was less than enthusiastic about having to watch more of it. The only thing that brought me back was my completionist mentality leading me to attempt a MAL 100% speedrun (so far my splits leave a lot to be desired.)The show spends a good chunk of it\'s opening act on this obnoxious...""I killed someone, and killing is always bad so I need to feel bad"" subplot. I get that he\'s still basically just a kid, but he\'s fighting a war, what did he expect? This is why I mentioned the incredibly childish outlook on death and war. It\'s one of my biggest pet peeves in fiction, the philosophy that killing is never justified. It may ultimately come down to a difference in theology, eastern religions teaching the no killing philosophy far more prominently and it just being so deeply ingrained in the culture while the Christianity that developed most modern western culture is pretty clear on retribution for the unrepentant. When that guy admits that he\'s going to continue being evil if Amou doesn\'t kill him, it annoys me so much that the show still treats Amou killing him as a bad thing somehow. It was objectively the right thing to do in that situation, and the amount of time they have him spend feeling sorry for himself doesn\'t make any sense.The rest of the season is full of plotting and scheming boring political stuff that just went right through my brain, not bothering to stick around past the end of each episode. Convoluted military double crosses just don\'t make for good entertainment in my mind. It\'s only possible to make those sorts of complex stories any fun for me if they\'re grounded in characters that I care about having real stakes in what\'s going on. And therein lies the real problem, the fact that I just don\'t care about any of these characters. The protagonist, as established, is a whiny teenager with no redeeming qualities and his friends Angst and The Girl One aren\'t any better.

At the beginning of this season, the answer is just told to us on our face, Maki, the engineer girl, made it, and it went evil, that's it, no explanation behind it's reasoning or anything, this not only gives us an underwhelming twist, but it also just ends up confusing the viewer when at the end, this machine that has done nothing but kill military forces, decides to spare the one that used to give him a fight, it just makes no sense to the audience because we have never seen him having any real interactions with Brad, in the end, Ghost was reduced to nothing but a plot device.At the end of it all, the story is half unresolved, while main characters may have had their moments, they say goodbye to the fight while the world is still at war, and Japan is not even half reclaimed, but I guess that's all that you can do in this type of setting.As for the animation itself, it's average, the best part of Kyoukai Senki is easily its Mecha designs, they want you to buy the kits after all, however, the fight scenes are extremely lackluster, with a lot of them consisting of static images, with effects planted on top of them, and camera pans to give you a sense of movement.In summary, unless you really, REALLY like watching 2D Mecha simply stand there and look cool, or you're interested in the model kits, or simply want closure on the series, then there is absolutely no reason for you to watch this, it's just plain, no substance, you're better off watching any other Mecha anime. incite you into buying the toys, a trope which this series seems to follow, but in the case of Kyoukai Senki, it is just the pure definition of plain mediocrity, just serviceable enough to convince you to buy one of the cool robots on screen, resulting in a story that is just bare bones.Many of the problems that were present in the first part of this anime return yet again for Part 2, including the seemingly lack of a clear target audience, one of the main problems this series has is that it feels too childish at times, despite being a war story, and this is reflected on both the cute mascots that aid the heroes, including the main protagonist, Amou, who in season 1 was just a plain heroic protagonist, here he's been hardened by war, and is now a serious guy, or at least that's what the show wanted you to think.Part 2 attempted to give answers to many of our questions that were planted on the previous season, and in case you were expecting to be surprised by any of these, then you're up for a disappointment, which unfortunately includes a lackluster ending.Going onto spoiler territory, our hero Amou, thorough the season, is seen to be hiding a secret, a reason for his now dark persona, this is revealed to be simply that he killed a soldier, in front of some kids that he barely knew, a soldier that was ready to end his life, in a war setting, in which Amou himself stated that he was okay to kill in the first season,and while you may say that saying one thing and actually doing it are different things, its still twist that serves an example of how underwhelming all of the plot points are on this season.The other characters fair no better, Gashin's character motivation, which was avenging his father by destroying Ghost, was kind of fulfilled at the end of Part one, I say kind of because Ghost was not fully destroyed, but Gashin never aknowledges this, he's just there to attempt to look cool and question Amou about his sudden edginess.Shion, just like in Part one, is just there, she never does anything of notice, there are tiny bits here and there where they try to give her some character, but it never goes anywhere.Plus the mascot AIs that are there to look cute and sell plushies, they don't really do much, except for an episode where they give them a Birthday party, which shows you just how much of a tone shift this can get.And Brad Watt, the charismatic rival of the first season, is reduced to nothing but a scheming villain through the season, during almost all of Part two, Brad does nothing but look suspicious, as his subordinates try to figure out what is up with him, rinse and repeat until the final episode where he just reveals that he wanted to expose his father, which barely accomplishes anything story wise.This brings us to the villain of the previous season, one of the big mysteries in Part 1 was the infamous jet-black, AI controlled mech known as Ghost, it's origin and it's intentions.

Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37599/Magatsu_Wahrheit__Zuerst,"[""Mwz is different from another mobile game adaptation, yes its base on game but Its more like to call it as original series. While developed MW game, Klab want to made anime which would realeased together with global release game. Theres no another main purpose beside just to promote the game. Surprisely, mwz turned out to be  the series which has its own identity, even klab added anime's characters and story  into the part of new game's arc.This low budget series is produced by Yokohama lab which is small new studio, Naoto Hosoda was picked as a director, a series composition, and as...a scriptwriter, 3 jobs in one hand. He said Klab gave him freedom to make his own story, thats why he make it more complicated like crime suspense overseas drama. Mwz is set set 20 years before the game, so that the timing of the game start is linked to the end of the animation and can be see as single story. The director also said that to tell deep story, he has set up another main character who is a little older from the main character in the game as the original character,  because Leocadio the main character in the game are too young 20 years ago in anime. The character designer said as for Imanuel there was an order not to make him too handsome, and she drew it such as quirky face as well as beautiful shape. When i saw the game, i wonder, in anime not only the story is deeper and darker but the character design visual is very different from the game, seem like Naoto Hosoda aimed the mature story so all the original character in anime look mature and not trying to be cool, if its for profit and gain attention from many viewer i thought the character design from the game more captive to alluring the viewer, more moe and typical visual from fantasy chara. But no, the director want to make a mature anime, his own anime lmaoo. When looking the game visual again, its like final fantasy, so the typical adaptation from the game usually would be like another isekai fantasy anime and look like typical light novel adaptation, but no , mwz is not adaptation, is base on game but it turned out to be dark suspense with political intrigue. It's too brave and very experimental to not following the original source.The story itself look like  AOT without titan & 3d manuever or Code Geast without robot and anti-hero mc  instead it has human experiment and monster and dinosaurus lol, mix those with Baccano element. MWZ's story probably set in 19th Century from visual, background, and clothes similar with steampunk anime, and at alternate German from its title. It has good background and the part i like is the corner of road hallway among the building. There are two main character in this series, one of main character is not typical protagonist, seems like he is coward but he turn out to be reliable compare to mc from another original series this season, Akudama Drive's mc  Swindler has the same situation accidentally got carried away and become an Akudama while Inummael become a smuggler of Headkeeper, but imagine in MWZ is not Swindler who is the MC but Hoodlum. Inummael's weird facial expressions also always awaited throughout the episodes, the anime maker are really want to make him not cool. MWZ also have one of the best antagonist this year, Herman's character is really creepy.Although it is clearly seen that  they have low budget from anime's OP and ED, but their songs are really good, Maon Kurosaki's operatic song is really suit with this series theme even if the OP's animation is just siluet, and the ED song also really suit though its only dark scene with credit,  its like OP and ED from american tv show, IMO its better than Raised by wolves' OP.The plan and production itself is only spend time 2 years from 2018, animation probably not as good as another original anime this year if we want to compare it, because MWZ is like more original series, usually an original series production take a longer time than adaptation series, it can be 4-7 years to make it, but MWZ storyline is one of the best for original this season or this year, its really well written and dark. a scriptwriter, 3 jobs in one hand.

Take one look at his hit-or-miss work repertoire of anime production over the years, and I\'d guarantee that you either love or hate the shows he\'s worked on (the more notable ones): Hataraku Maou-sama!, Juuni Taisen, Mirai Nikki, Shuffle!, even Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete. And now, this show being another addition onto the reputable director\'s works, and I can finally understand why.Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst, translated: Ominous Truth: the First, based on the mobile game of the same name (but without the Zuerst).If you have...no idea what to understand of this mobage adaptation, I\'d like to refer you to the official anime website and check out the ""Specials"" tab, because that\'s where the magic of the show is based upon. The TL;DR is this: KLab Games offered director Naoto Hosoda a free pass to make up his envisioned story of Magatsu Wahrheit, so that both the anime and the game have a similar, overarching story, albeit a timeskip that still honours and establishes the core settings. Not to mention that Hosoda himself is a fan of western live-action and episodic, espionage drama, so it really nails in the niche look of the show that is a rarity in anime form. Not to worry if you\'ve been itching to play the game, because this show can be taken as a one-shot format of a prequel story.The Golden Rule technique of ""Show, Don\'t Tell"" is an art in and of itself, to which the story and characters are related through sensory details and actions. Rather than just ham-fisting readers/viewers with exposition, it fosters with the immersion build-up, allowing them to “be in the room” with the characters. And that\'s how Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst sets the scene for this show, which takes place 20 years before the game\'s beginning. Two young characters, seemingly unrelated to one another: Innumael, just an ordinary blue-collar worker, and Leocadio, a soldier in the Wahrheit Imperial Army. Through ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" that involves a highly-prized smuggled weapon, and tying both character\'s fate and destiny individually and together to fighting for what they believe is right with their lives, to the seemingly ""random"" characters of affiliations, the cat-and-mouse ""Two sides of the coin"" battle between organizations, cults and empires are truly a force to be reckoned with. Another Akudama Drive-type show, but in a historical military-esque setting that does the suspense well, and keeping up with the illusive foreshadowing of balanced pacing and exposition that defines both the anime and game as a single package. Props to Yuichiro Momose for co-supervising both the scriptwriting and screenplay with Hosoda.The characters are really interesting as well: Every single one of them is kept being purposeful to the plot that accumulates overtime, tantamount to the endings of stories with solid foundations that actually use their resources to the full. At first, you\'re left wondering why both Innumael and Leocadio, as young chaps as they can be, seem like fools in a river full of piranhas that have people creep up to them for their actions. But as the story progresses, as we play the ""Guessing Game"" of theorized craftsmanship, it keeps the extremely tight pacing consistent, while fleshing out the execution of amounting pressures and tensions enough to keep you focused and invested. Every single decision and motivation made between all characters (as many and difficult as you can count and follow, besides Innumael and Leo) actually make sense that moves the story along, and doesn\'t make you feel like you\'ve wasted an inch of time on this show. That to me can be hit-or-miss, but it really keeps you on your toes of the next plot pointer(s).Some notable characters of a lightning round:- Both veteran VAs Asutshi Abe and Yuuki Ono were really good fits for both Innumael and Leocadio.- The one, the only veteran VA Kenjiro Tsuda, voicing Innumael\'s superior Captain Helman. The instaneously recognizable gangster voice dubbing a ""grim reaper""-like character, that is the charismatic ""scummy"" voice we all know and love.- Character designs don\'t go as nice and well-drawn as Schaake Gutheil. A red-haired, green-eyes girl, and a member of the mysterious organization Headkeeper, she excels at being both serious and a bad-ass.The reason why I say notable is because this is newcomer Akiko Sugizono\'s debut anime doing character design all by herself. Having drawn only female characters, and it was a monumental task for her to draw and design male characters, and it was an insane challenge for her. Luckily, Naoto Hosoda also had dips in the formulation of the character designs, so it\'s a win-win on both sides of the story.The music is also another fascinating viewpoint. Director Naoto Hosoda explains that the show\'s voice-acting was done during the COVID season, so most of the Seiyuu have to do their recording remotely, as opposed to the regular sound-mixing studio where the entire cast will gather and do their recording all at once. As a consequence of the pandemic, it took 3 times as long for the entire cast to record their lines, but thanks to the veteran cast\'s skills and professionalism, along with sound director Kisuke Koizumi, the VA job is handled graciously. Add in another veteran of sound composer Masaru Yokohara (Kanata no Astra, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso), and wow, what a star-studded production team that is a blessing to add to the show\'s grimacing atmosphere.Maon Kurosaki attempting an opera-like OP, and H-el-ical// with another dark-edged ED, the OST does a pretty good job setting the mood and the theme of the series, matching its American counterparts of a classic visual opening and silhouetted black-screen ending with ""historically classical"" music.The elephant in the room is undoubtedly the mediocre visuals and animation, but it\'s a no-brainer of a surprise coming from the now 5-year-old studio, Yokohama Animation Laboratory. They did some ONA co-productions in the past, but it\'s not until Miru Tights that they branched out doing original work. Even with the KLab Games\' deal with Summer 2020\'s Lapis Re:Lights mixed-media franchise, these 2 shows showed potential for the studio to do low-budget animation that\'s a considerable pass. And everything about both shows can be applied here, just with a dark, cinematic tone (while sticking with KLab\'s dealership). In spite of the worsening animation (that\'s lucrative of a low-budget studio), the visuals do get the job done explicitly with art director Hirotsugu Kakoi at the helm, expressing the entire show in its own unique class.Despite a small production team of a mix between old and new staff, an S-Grade of a character voice-dubbing cast, and masterfully-crafted soulful music of veteran directors, honestly, this show stands on a marvel of its own merit. It\'s more than just your typical ""cash-cow"" mobage anime adaptation, and I feel that this is one of the few pedigrees of game adaptations that truly gets the formula right: beckoning anime-onlys to play the game to discover what the advertised game is all about.I\'m just going to say this: even if you have no intentions to check out the mobile game, this is a hidden gem of a must-watch. As I mentioned in the beginning: this is classic Naoto Hosoda storytelling at its finest, and it\'s expected that not a lot of people will like it (as evident by MAL scores), but please, give this a try. no idea what to understand of this mobage adaptation, I\'d like to refer you to the official anime website and check out the ""Specials"" tab, because that\'s where the magic of the show is based upon.

It's really good and very enjoyable. I'll explain, but I hope my review encourages more to check out this show and what it is offering so far, as it's a thrilling roller coaster so far, and it has been very enjoyable.We start with the story, as we follow not just one, but two main characters, as they seem to be on the opposite sides. Though through different reasons, but that is just what makes it interesting already. It's not just a simple story of bad vs good, as there is more to it. Getting...the perspective of both sides, rather than mostly just one. Along with having possible foreshadowing moments that could lead to plot lines down the line that could prove to be very impactful.The characters on both sides are very interesting too. There is always something about them, the supposed bad guys seem like level headed people despite their deeds, while the supposed good law enforcement seem a little bit off, as if something is going on there. Which just adds more to the interest factor. While our two main MCs, they're both good in their own right, and it's interesting to see how they deal with the hand that has been given to them. Where it just be following a new job in law enforcement. Or having to go with the 'bad' guys, all because of an incident, and handling all of that pressure. It's pretty intense.The art style can be gloomy at points, but more to fit the scenes of the show. But it can be clean and nicely coloured when it's more brighter scenes. Really well done there. Same can be said for the music, all of it really adds to the atmosphere.Should you watch this and give it a chance? Hell yes! It's very enjoyable, and I can see it becoming more so as it goes along! the perspective of both sides, rather than mostly just one.

This anime is so underrated, please ignore the rating here in MAL and try to watch this series and be the judge yourself.For introductions of this anime, there are 2-3 MCs, I guess, like they have different sides and views, and for me I can't choose only one of them to be the main MC since they have reasons of their own.The setting is, I guess, 19-20th century technology but with magic. "", ""This show is one of the best this season and my personal favourite. I love the world building, the setting, the character design and the suspenseful moments it delivers. No generic romance or fanservice to interrupt the flow of the story which is really well paced. I never had to check how many minutes are left, it's just so good.It's urban fantasy with no isekai elements or anything but great dark and engaging themes where you explore BOTH sides of these factions that seems to have understandable motivations as we explore their story further and further. There's good use of political intrigue, similar to ACCA...13, the setting of FMAB and it keeps you wondering at times.It's a show that does visual world building and story-telling, you can understand the character motivations without them monologuing half the time to you and it's what I really want from shows like this.The characters of this series are really good and they all have their backstories and really distinctive personalities, even the smaller but very memorable characters like Schaake, Benjamin, Arnolt and Irma.Ultimately, the series kind of does a dual main character viewpoint with more weight on Inumanuel than Leo but both have their roles to play. Inu is my favourite MC of the year, he has this cowardly streak about him but it's really satisfying to see him grow and even though he can be a bit of a coward, his heart is always in the right place and this is what makes him so compelling to watch. The emotions are always on point with him, he alone can carry this show.Leocadio is also a very interesting character as he balances the morality of his actions against the logic of following an order, haunted by the tragedy on its past. And so many more other characters that we see their viewpoint from which makes the world so much more interesting, yet never feeling bloated at the same time.Music is awesome by composer of Gundam IBO and YLIA, background art is freaking awesome and this show was just made for me. The animation does suffer near the 2nd half of the series but honestly, the story carries the series very well and I much prefer a really good story than stellar animation.At the end, it's a pretty unique series, tackling serious dark urban fantasy themes with some supernatural elements, with an amazing and underrated cast of characters.

And when was the last time that the tension was so high that you sat stock still with bated breath, unable to move because you were that enthralled by what was unfolding before you? One more….. and when was the last time that an anime, having all of this, also included a massive conspiracy that was well thought-out, related entirely to the environment and setting, and had villains operating it that were actually fearsome...and not just plot devices?Honestly, I don’t think there’s ever been an anime like this. But there is one now, and it’s roared into the final season of 2020 like a pack of lions chasing after their kill. And honestly, that’s how it feels watching this show, as if you’re trying to escape from multiple things coming at you at one time and you gotta think of a way out fast, within milliseconds, and you need to constantly keep doing this, or else you’re fucking dead.That anime is ZUERST, obviously, an experience so totally unique to anime that the most comparable narrative and atmosphere to it, without giving too much away about the plot, is in fact the 2013 action-adventure, award-winning game “The Last of Us”. While there may or may not be structural similarities between the two in overarching narrative (again, I don’t want to spoil any of the plot for ZUERST because it’s just soooo thrilling), they both perfectly manifest the feelings of dread and fear of not being able to necessarily help others because it’s hard enough to help yourself in the first place when you’re on a constant loop of running for your life.Narratively, ZUERST is a perfect representation of “show, don’t tell”. There’s no exposition in this: it throws the audience into a familiar, yet unfamiliar world without explaining anything, instead leaving it up to them to discover what’s going on through context clues and interpreting what characters may indirectly imply about their situation. Further, everything develops organically, as if it’s actually unfolding in real time in front of the audience without any real “plot armor” or forced writing. There are multiple mysteries tied together among the expansive cast of characters which are not directly revealed to the audience, but rather can be both inferred and also predicted based on information the audience receives over time. Basically, foreshadowing plays a key role in keeping the audience engaged because there is enough to make accurate predictions about what is going to happen if paying attention, yet subtle enough that it doesn’t spoil any major plot points and will be often missed by the average viewer with not enough patience to keep a watchful eye out for the subtleties. One last thing – if you aren’t focused while watching, you will very easily miss key details that will leave you somewhat confused later in the story. I say this only because it speaks volumes to the importance of each and every scene of this story: there is NOTHING here that is filler or could be excluded without negatively impacting the plot and the flow.If this all sounds interesting enough already, a short analysis of the cast of characters will pique your intrigue even further. For starters, the main cast of characters are all clearly defined. The protagonist of the show is an interesting case and receives massive amounts of development throughout the show. How he progresses through scene after scene is very identifiable. Of course, the only way this would be super noticeable is if he changes massively as a character over time – which he does, and all for the better. But even though it’s like finding a horse in a haystack – very easy – his progression is way more defined than “very insecure at the beginning, strong and confident at the end”. The nuances of his progression, once again, can be seen over time. Some anime has one or two major scenes that change a character, causing it to feel somewhat forced. In ZUERST, this is not the case. Everything changes him, and this is apparent.The protagonist himself, while being the meat of the story, isn’t always the focus of every scene; rather, there are plenty of scenes that don’t include him. The group the protagonist finds himself joining forces with is also full of very defined characters with clear goals and objectives. They all come from relatively different backgrounds, but their shared common interests are what keeps them together and united for their purpose. Each character gets ample amount of screen time and are not just plot devices but actually relevant enough to the story to justify giving them the time of day.The antagonistic group also receives heavy focus. This is vastly different from 99% of other anime where every episode the main villain receives one scene where he’s maniacally laughing or sniveling and twisting his hands like a dumbass. Nay, the antagonistic force in ZUERST has just as much characterization and definition as the protagonist and his group. The head honcho, voiced by rising star Kenjirou Tsuda, is clearly a force to be reckoned with and not overpoweringly so. He’s got a clear motive for his actions, makes his own decisions even if they don’t align with his side, and his background is explored enough that one might be able to justify him turning into the “monster” that he has become. Meanwhile, his comrades have their own reasons for doing what they do, and all the actions that all of the characters take in ZUERST just make sense. There’s no dumb bullshittery or stupid decisions made; just characters doing what is in their own self interests.I could speak of the environment as a character, because it kinda is, and you’ll see why if you watch the show. But to go into that now would be spoilers, and it would be much more fun to find out what I mean if you just go watch yourself!The other major thing I want to focus on here is the art and animation. While the animation isn’t always top notch, what struck me immediately from the first episode was how fluid and consistent it is. There are no shortcuts taken involving quick cuts to avoid animating a sword being swung; instead, there’s lots of sword swinging, gun shooting, and running that for 85% of the time, looks smooth and very accurate. If I had to compare the animation of ZUERST to the typical seasonal show, I’d say it looks better than 90% of all seasonal anime. It’s definitely consistent.The art, however, is more than just consistent. It is INCREDIBLE. With this type of anime where the tension of trying to survive and uncover hidden truths is the key to making it feel right, the atmosphere is crucial towards relaying that tension. The shots in this anime do the wonderful story absolute justice. They are just so detailed, are extremely visually appealing, and really are the driving force behind the cohesive, immersive experience. They pull you into the world and keep you there, alongside the characters, as if you are right next to them!The most praiseworthy aspect of the art in ZUERST is by FAR AND AWAY the facial expressions of the characters. Never in my life have I ever seen a such diverse arsenal of facial expressions. Expressions are the key to making characters come alive, and never before have I felt such intense emotions from characters in an anime. When facial expressions cause your blood to run cold and chills to run up and down your entire body, you KNOW a show has succeeded at making you feel immersed and care about the characters.There’s so much more I could go into about this show, even without diving into spoiler territory, but I’ve already gone on for long enough, so I’ll leave off with one last thing:The soundtrack to this anime is glorious. That is all. If you love amazing soundtracks, watch this if only for that reason.There are plenty of reasons to love ZUERST. I legitimately couldn’t find a single reason to dislike it, and I was immersed enough to not even notice any mishaps or issues with the plot whatsoever. The animation and art by a low-budget studio for some reason blow 90% of other seasonal shows out of the water, even if the animation did decline over the span of the show.Director Naoto Hosoda has finally succeeded in creating a near masterpiece anime, and it is evident that his impact on the anime as a whole – the direction altogether being fantastic – was a huge reason. The scene composition, the framing, the shots, the seamless transitions: everything was just incredibly well-crafted.It is without any regrets whatsoever that I can say clearly: ZUERST is the best anime of 2020. and not just plot devices?Honestly, I don’t think there’s ever been an anime like this. But there is one now, and it’s roared into the final season of 2020 like a pack of lions chasing after their kill.

He’s got a clear motive for his actions, makes his own decisions even if they don’t align with his side, and his background is explored enough that one might be able to justify him turning into the “monster” that he has become. Meanwhile, his comrades have their own reasons for doing what they do, and all the actions that all of the characters take in ZUERST just make sense. There’s no dumb bullshittery or stupid decisions made; just characters doing what is in their own self interests.I could speak of the environment as a character, because it kinda is, and you’ll see why if you watch the show. But to go into that now would be spoilers, and it would be much more fun to find out what I mean if you just go watch yourself!The other major thing I want to focus on here is the art and animation. While the animation isn’t always top notch, what struck me immediately from the first episode was how fluid and consistent it is. There are no shortcuts taken involving quick cuts to avoid animating a sword being swung; instead, there’s lots of sword swinging, gun shooting, and running that for 85% of the time, looks smooth and very accurate. If I had to compare the animation of ZUERST to the typical seasonal show, I’d say it looks better than 90% of all seasonal anime. It’s definitely consistent.The art, however, is more than just consistent. It is INCREDIBLE. With this type of anime where the tension of trying to survive and uncover hidden truths is the key to making it feel right, the atmosphere is crucial towards relaying that tension. The shots in this anime do the wonderful story absolute justice. They are just so detailed, are extremely visually appealing, and really are the driving force behind the cohesive, immersive experience. They pull you into the world and keep you there, alongside the characters, as if you are right next to them!The most praiseworthy aspect of the art in ZUERST is by FAR AND AWAY the facial expressions of the characters. Never in my life have I ever seen a such diverse arsenal of facial expressions. Expressions are the key to making characters come alive, and never before have I felt such intense emotions from characters in an anime. When facial expressions cause your blood to run cold and chills to run up and down your entire body, you KNOW a show has succeeded at making you feel immersed and care about the characters.There’s so much more I could go into about this show, even without diving into spoiler territory, but I’ve already gone on for long enough, so I’ll leave off with one last thing:The soundtrack to this anime is glorious. That is all. If you love amazing soundtracks, watch this if only for that reason.There are plenty of reasons to love ZUERST. I legitimately couldn’t find a single reason to dislike it, and I was immersed enough to not even notice any mishaps or issues with the plot whatsoever. The animation and art by a low-budget studio for some reason blow 90% of other seasonal shows out of the water, even if the animation did decline over the span of the show.Director Naoto Hosoda has finally succeeded in creating a near masterpiece anime, and it is evident that his impact on the anime as a whole – the direction altogether being fantastic – was a huge reason. The scene composition, the framing, the shots, the seamless transitions: everything was just incredibly well-crafted.It is without any regrets whatsoever that I can say clearly: ZUERST is the best anime of 2020.', '***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***Magatsu Wahrheit is a mobile rpg game which I tried to play but since my cellphone is crap and mostly filled with apps that I need, I could only play the prologue before I had to uninstall it. From what I could play, the game is a generic rpg with generic plot, generic characters, generic gameplay and a generic no name no face self insert protagonist so why would anyone bother with its anime adaptation? Especially when anime based on videogames aren’t exactly good, King’s Raid from the same season is an example of that.Another reason to pass on this anime is...the studio in charge of it, it’s pretty new and they did nothing of value as of yet, heck, the more famous work from them is Miru Tights, a short episodes comedy dedicated completely to a fetish.Something that caught my attention while playing the game is that the setting was more medieval than the anime, which combines fantasy elements with an european like setting with contemporary technology and clothes (not present day technology and clothes of course). Combining that with how different Leocadio looks in the game made me think that the anime was going for its own completely different story, well that’s because I don’t know german and thus I didn’t know that the Zuerst in the title means the first or beginning, meaning, it’s actually a prequel to the game.Anyways, Magatsu Wahrheit combines several elements from other shows of its season and year to grab attention, is based on a mobile rpg just like King’s Raid, it has an european like setting and messed up nobels like Moriarty the Patriot and a dual protagonist focus, just like…well, many other shows from this year (Moriarty, Deca-Dence, Runway de Waratte, BNA, to name a few).Its downside, I have to admit, is not being exciting, it plays out like a mystery instead of an action adventure and thus it has a lot of talking and investigation which are not going to thrill many viewers.On top of that the visuals are nothing like in the PV, they are weak in the beginning and downright pathetic towards the end, making it even duller to watch, the setting is pretty good looking, the backgrounds are well made, but almost everything else in the visuals falls apart completely. The character designs are terrible despite standing out a little from the norm, they lack detail, shading, lightning, they are not even completely drawn at times, and the qualily drops are making things worse, the characters barely look good because the artwork is weak and the in-between is poorly made and keeps giving them deformed faces in all of the episodes, especially the second and third to last.The motions are ok in the beginning, there’s a good fight in the first episode with a good choreography, but as the episodes goes on, they become worse and worse, the movements are very sloppy even in moments in relaxation, so just imagine how bad they are whenever there’s action.The special effects are overall ok when it comes to shots and magic but I have to admit that there were pretty looking moments such as a certain thing beneath the Capital and the explosión in the last two episodes which reminded me of Watchmen, blowing up everything and even showing the horrors of having people being dragged on by it. In general, the last episode is better animated than the rest, but not by much.I really should stop talking about the sound when I have nothing to say about it, voice acting is ok, nothing particular about it except for the fact that the distortion effect for the monsters is good, but there are at least 4 soldiers voiced by the same guy and his voice is weird and his acting not really convincing, sound effects are pretty good and impactful, the music is fine too, the ending is fine and the opening is pretty great, too bad modern audiences don’t seem to be very fond of instrumental or opera openings, don’t miss the 8 minute full version of it by the way, it has different sections and it’s completely different from the minute and a half version.The big plus of the show is having a conflict which is interesting yet simple on paper but multi layered on execution, here there are monsters appearing near the city and villages and killing people, the military have to take care of them on the Capital of the Empire and the Diet orders that every city has to protect itself however they can, thus they are unable to protect other places, which obviously makes the citizens and villagers unhappy and hostile towards them.There is a group of rebels that want to help the people to take down the monsters, there are episodes showing how the monsters attack the different places, as well as some episodes showing people about to die from a decease which they also try to find a cure for, there is the Diet that controls everything and they lead some sort of plan to take the Empire and they are also making experiments with people and turning them to monsters, with the idea of it being a next step in human evolution or something generic like that and the series does not shy away from showing some of these people losing control and attacking others, including their loved ones (like in Fog Hill of Five Elements) without censorship and there are double agents and traitors on both sides, which are of course shown investigating or plotting.All of the above as well as the way they are connected and the cause of it all is shown with a proper pacing and without much exposition, despite featuring lots of terms from the games, it’s nothing like other videogame adaptations where there are lots of exposition through talking nor complicated explanations of complicated terminology, everything is shown by the characters’ actions and interactions and the world building.Another plus is how neither side is shown as completely good or bad and how most if not every character seems to have their own agenda and doing something both on their own and as part of a group all the time. There are evil nobles like in Moriarty that rape their maids, get them pregnant, mistreat them and even lead them to suicide (this reminded me of Journey of Elaina by the way), as well as others that are part of the rebels and genuinely want to help the people. There are soldiers that are messed up in the head and are shown as ruthless and sadistic, and they like to torture, kill and beat others, as well as good soldiers that genuinely want to protect the citizens and becomes allies with Headkeeper once they learn the truth.There are characters such as the father of the red haired girl who seem clueless to the whole thing but they are actually doing something behind the scenes with also good reasons for doing so. And as I said earlier, there are traitors and double agents on both sides, that makes neither side to have complete advantage over the other nor be incompetent and there’s a somewhat high level of tension because of it.Another good thing is having two protagonists and having the narrative jumping between both of them and showing what both of them are doing all the time. Leocadio begins as a naive soldier with an idealized vision of the military and his learning about the shady and corrupt side of it, before deciding to practically turn against it, kill a superior, and stop the plans of the corrupt government alongside Headkeeper. Innumael is a normal worker who gets dragged by the whole thing by accident in a mostly believable way, beginning as a coward who only cares about his safety (which is understandable) before actually becoming a proper member of Headkeeper and wanting to help others, kinda like the protagonist of Akudama Drive, even becoming a wanted criminal in a similar way. Showing a bit of their backgrounds, their families, how they get involved in the conflict, the change in the interactions between the two of them as enemies at first and allies in the end was also a nice way to flesh them out.I have to admit though, that aside from them, every other character that seemed to be important at first gets a secondary role or disappear in the second half. The red haired girl is the prime example of that, she seemed to be a central part of the conflict at first, even showing a bit of her everyday life when they get back to the city, and then she gets kinda tossed aside in the final episodes, there’s a blonde guy who disappears after the fifth episode before sniping someone in the head in the last episode out of nowhere. There’s a kid that we never see again and so on. At least every death feels important because the show follows what everyone does most if not all the time.This has to do with the weird pacing the show has, it may feel slow in the beginning because it is not exciting but that was allowing for mostly everything to make sense and feel organic and believable with proper build up and treatment.That, and the fact that the amount of episodes was unknown until the show was two weeks to end, made me think that the series was going to be at least a two cour show ending in March of next year but that wasn’t the case, the series clearly speeds up in the second half and it starts using silly resolutions such as last moment saves from characters appearing out of nowhere with lazy explanations or the rebels easily infiltrating different places and posing as soldiers. This, alongside the book from the second episode and some unexplained things in the last episode, such as Leocadio’s seconds of power and Innumael’s plot armor, among other things, affect a little the credibility of the whole thing.With that said, there’s some sort of excuse for all of that, which is basically the Diet playing around with them because their plan was practically unstoppable and because they were basically setting a trap for them and capturing them for their experiments, yet I feel like Headkeeper should have known that, if that thing was beneath the capital, then the real light would appear there, making the explosion near the end somewhat avoidable. That’s why the finale will feel weird and unsatisfying, aside from being incomplete, it could have been avoided, and will definitely feel rushed, heck, the PV showed a fight between the two protagonists which never happened, so there’s definitely stuff that was cut off from the main series.That said, the finale is uncommon and somewhat refreshing for the side that wins in the end, as well as anticipated early on, but it’s definitely not a good one. Being a prequel to the game is not an excuse, for all the criticism Rogue One can get, the ending made sense for sending off the events of the original Star Wars and felt satisfying for everything that happened in the movie. Heck, in anime there’s Gundam the Origin which is an amazing prequel to the original series and fits almost perfectly within the timeline while still having a solid ending for its own story.In the end, Magatsu Wahrheit is basically the Deca-Dence of its season, a somewhat worth watching show, especially for being based on a videogame, with a mostly decent plot and a mosty decent cast of characters that was overlooked by many (if not most) people that sadly didn’t last more to tap all of its potential. I thought it was going to be the best show of the year but it’s definitely nowhere near as good as it could have been if it was longer and better paced. Being better animated and a little more exciting and memorable instead of making me rewatch it from the beginning once I finished it in order to write something about it definitely would have helped too.And now, a little breakdown of each aspect for a little more justified ratingVISUALS - 4/10Well made backgrounds and effects but very bad artwork, character figures and motions.SOUND - 8/10Good music, very good sound effects and acceptable voice acting.STORY - 6/10Interesting and well presented conflict with proper pacing and logic in the first half but not so much in the second, with a pretty bad finale.CHARACTERS - 7/10Proactive and well established cast of characters that stay relevant throughout most of its duration with very fleshed out and evolving protagonists, but some of them are completely forgotten by the end.VALUE - 3/10Mostly unknown and very forgettable title. Rewatching it definitely helps to notice some things that can go unnotice on a first watch but it’s something most people would not do for the show is frankly not exciting and on top of that it’s pretty badly animated.ENJOYMENT - 7/10What can I say?

I believe it would be unfortunate if this anime was overlooked for just that reason.First, I really like the pace of the story, since for me, has kept me looking forward to the next episodes.  Plots and sub-plots are introduced steadily without the usual exhaustive exposition most animes rely on in the first couple of episodes.  They evolve at a steady...pace that expands the scope of the underlying conspiracy for the world/country of this anime.The main character's predicament of being pulled into an organization, which is at odds with the government of this anime, sets a strong backdrop for the main character to grow.  Unlike the usual main character anime tropes, the character is fairly grounded in a way that you would meet a person in the real world, making it easy to imagine yourself in his shoes.  Despite the main character's cowardice and lack of conviction, he faces his predicaments in a relatable way that people would do in a non-stereotypical shonen jump character kind of way.  As the story goes on, I found the display of the main character's growth strengthen my appeal to him.The supporting characters are likeable as well and any adversaries that I have seen so far can be lent some sympathy.  One of the strengths of this anime is that there are some real consequences that befall some characters in the beginning, which makes the stakes of all the characters in the anime seem precarious.The setting of this anime would be reminiscent of the world war one era, however it is fictionalized as some characters using melee weapons are able to deflect bullets, monsters are a thing, and there is magic.  That being said, the fantasy aspects of this anime are not excessive as there are no overpowered characters with saiyan or naruto-esque levels of speed or abilities.Overall the strength of this anime lies with its story, character development, and pace.  I hope this review makes you give this anime a chance.EDIT: Brought the overall score down one point because of the ending being so wanting. pace that expands the scope of the underlying conspiracy for the world/country of this anime.The main character's predicament of being pulled into an organization, which is at odds with the government of this anime, sets a strong backdrop for the main character to grow.

And not BOTH leads, just the little pansy who suddenly becomes a hero. Because yeah, we haven't seen that character type before.Other than that, I can overlook the character designs, the generic facial animations and the text book personality traits as seen in this title.Overall, it's a huge skip unless you like cookie, then enjoy this baked treat courtesy of the a-typical cookie cutter that seems to be Japanese game animation adaptations. the worst part of this anime is the characters, and not all the characters, just a the lead.

It doesn't.Like some other reviewers said, Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst doesn't have the typical romance, isekai, harem, comedy elements that are common in more fantasy shows nowadays. Maybe a part of the hype comes from Zuerst being an anime adaptation of the game of the same name, but for me, it just doesn't hit.None of the characters are particularly likable, the plot itself was predictable, and the fantasy elements like magic were pretty much on the backburner the entire time....The best part of the show is the ending. I thought the last episode was good, but the time I spent getting to that point was definitely not worth it in my opinion. None of the characters ever really grew on me, and even now, as I write this review, I am still confused about the point of the show.I will give some credit where it's due though. The background art was absolutely stunning, but I wish the same could be said for the characters themselves. While the background was pretty, the character design was often inconsistent. The only comedy in the show came from the strange faces or inconsistencies of the art, otherwise, there wasn't much of anything there.Honestly, I can genuinely say that I'm glad I'm done watching Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst.04 ❁. Below average, although it can still be enjoyable. Either it doesn't take itself too seriously, or there is just enough substance to make it bearable. It's the definition of subpar.

The few reviews that I tend to write are pretty well planned out if nothing else, but this time around I\'m going to just write this as I go to use it as a way to work through my feelings on what I just watched. So, yeah.... To that end, I\'ll still keep my usual category breakout format and get right into it:-----Story - 3 out of 10-----Magatsu Wahrheit is an anime based on a mobile game which takes place...in magitech setting, fusing industrial age modern esthetics with classic sword and sorcery fantasy elements mixed in. The main plot centers on how a normal truck driver gets mixed up in a resistance organization while a bunch of political intrigue concerning a magical disease and experimentation goes on in the background. To its credit, I felt that the story structure of the series went really well at first! They drop you into an interesting situation without spoon feeding you a bunch of backstory. Things for the most part naturally come to light and seem pretty interesting. But then, the series just kind of loses focus. They\'re setting up a bunch of ""stuff"" and I\'m watching wondering if any of it is going to actually go anywhere. There are a few sparse bright spots, like a subplot that takes place with a small village in the forest that I thought was genuinely interesting and touching. But it mostly just meanders along until I absolutely lose all interest in the story. And then finally, they committed the dreadful sin of a grand exposition dump with took up the entire first half of episode 10, betraying the previous more natural storytelling structure. It was so frustratingly bad that I would have been pulling at my hair if it wasn\'t for the fact that I shave my head. Then the ending came.... Now, I don\'t really mind a non-conclusive ending, but the final ""and the story continues...."" crap that they pulled at the end of this left me wondering what the point was in all of this?? I mean, I assume the point was to advertise the mobile game, but still. Could they not have done better? It felt like this was originally supposed to be a 24 episode series, but it wasn\'t doing all that well so they decided to make it half as long. I don\'t know. Maybe I\'m missing something. Maybe this story will appeal to an audience that is more into political intrigue than I am, but man, I just thought the story was an utter mess.-----Art - 4 out of 10-----If I had to describe the art and animation of this series in one word, it\'d be ""inconsistent"". Yes, having some inconsistencies in the production for a weekly TV anime is to be expected, especially when also dealing with COVID-19 leading up to and during its production. But this is some pretty bad stuff. First thing is the hilariously bad opening credits ""animation"". The first few episodes had a temp-opening which was little more than a Windows 95 screensaver with some text over it. Then, they eventually got a ""finished"" OP together which was barely better, mostly consisting of the series\' central artifact floating around with silhouette action animation mostly consisting of scenes from the show itself. Oh, and then the ending credits didn\'t even bother with trying to do anything as it was just text scroll on a black screen. Anyway, so what about the look of the series proper? Well, there were some actual good points to this as the animation of the big action sequence in the first episode looked pretty cool! And the look of the series was unique and interesting enough overall; not your typical fantasy look for the most part so it can act as a bit of a breath of fresh air. But then, some of the character designs just look weird and there is a plethora of off-model faces that began to make me laugh constantly at one point. Again, I don\'t know how fair this criticism is when this kind of thing isn\'t particularly rare in anime, plus dealing with COVID could have been a factor, but man this largely sucked.-----Sound - 6 out of 10-----The highest score I\'m giving goes to Sound! And it\'s just an ""it\'s alright"" 6-score in the end. I felt that a good amount of the music was really nice. I was especially a fan of this one particular recurring little ditty that was in damn near every episode. And the voice acting overall wasn\'t bad, but wasn\'t particularly memorable either. Honestly, this might have gotten a better score if there was more music, but they did re-use a LOT of stuff. But hey, overall, not bad.-----Characters - 5 out of 10-----One of my biggest personal things in fiction is that I can still enjoy a series with a weak story as long as I have some nice characters to latch onto. Unfortunately, this is largely a plot-focused story so there is only so much that good characters can do. And sadly, when it comes to the characters in Magatsu Wahrheit, as a whole they were mediocre at best. I did find our lead Innumael to be enjoyable/interesting for the most part, although he did legitimately get annoying at times. Spunky little Irma was probably my second favorite character in the series, but she wasn\'t in it enough to make much of an impact. Aside from that, the characters didn\'t do much for me. I thought the series especially had a major villain problem. One of the best antagonists was a psychotics military commander, but he was pretty much just generic pure evil dude with little real motivation and once he was out of the picture there wasn\'t much to fill the void since all of the other bad stuff was being worked ""from the shadows"" or whatnot.-----Enjoyment - 4 out of 10-----So how was my personal enjoyment of this series? Well, that\'s kind of what I\'m trying to figure out. I ended up giving this series a personal score of a ""4"", something that I don\'t do very often with my broad tastes and largely forgiving critiques of entertainment. But with how empty and pointless the whole experience of watching this felt, it definitely fit the ""Bad"" label that a ""4"" holds in the ""Your Score"" dropdown on MAL. While I was enjoying myself and interested in the series for the first few episodes, I then began to enjoy it less and less until it became a legitimate chore to sit through around the 8th episode. But at that point, I was in it for the long haul and just watching it once a week wasn\'t PURE torture or anything. But man, in the end I just couldn\'t grasp what the point of this all was. Innumael kind of seemed to have grown throughout the series, but also mostly felt the same. The main promo image used on Funimation\'s page for this series shows a 2-halves look at Innumael and Leocadio, one half of them as they look at the beginning of the series and the other showing more badass versions of them sometime in the future. But in the scope of the anime, these fully badass versions are never seen, with the only part that\'s truly realized being the cut across Leo\'s face. Again, it feels like this was originally meant to be a 24 episode series that got cut short, or you\'re just expected to move from this to the mobile game. Who knows. But whatever the reasoning is, I felt fully unsatisfied with this series in every way and it hurts all the more because of its earlier potential.-----Overall - 5 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----In the end, I\'m going to go ahead and bump my overall review score for this series up one point from my personal enjoyment score. I admit that a major reason for that is me being influenced by the fact that prior to me writing this review, the lowest review score given was a ""6"" and the literal majority of reviews posted are 9s or better. I MUST be missing something, right? Did I just ""not get"" this series? Again, I\'m generally rather kind with my critique of anime as I have pretty broad tastes. Usually, if I don\'t like something that others do, I can recognize it largely as a matter of personal taste. And granted, the average score for this series is not great (6.60 at the time of writing), so maybe it\'s mostly just people who enjoyed the series that are inspired enough to review it, while those who didn\'t like it simply didn\'t care enough to write a review? I don\'t know. I guess there might be something here to enjoy if magitech and political intrigue are things you\'re REALLY into. But for me, that just wasn\'t enough to counteract the inconsistent production, incomplete and uninteresting story, and overall meh characters. And with that, I guess this came out just about as extensive as most of my other reviews. Well, hope this was somehow helpful for someone to read! It was at least a nice way for me to gather my thoughts on this series. in magitech setting, fusing industrial age modern esthetics with classic sword and sorcery fantasy elements mixed in. The main plot centers on how a normal truck driver gets mixed up in a resistance organization while a bunch of political intrigue concerning a magical disease and experimentation goes on in the background. To its credit, I felt that the story structure of the series went really well at first! They drop you into an interesting situation without spoon feeding you a bunch of backstory. Things for the most part naturally come to light and seem pretty interesting. But then, the series just kind of loses focus. They\'re setting up a bunch of ""stuff"" and I\'m watching wondering if any of it is going to actually go anywhere. There are a few sparse bright spots, like a subplot that takes place with a small village in the forest that I thought was genuinely interesting and touching. But it mostly just meanders along until I absolutely lose all interest in the story. And then finally, they committed the dreadful sin of a grand exposition dump with took up the entire first half of episode 10, betraying the previous more natural storytelling structure.

It was at least a nice way for me to gather my thoughts on this series.', ""Now, I know what you're thinking: a game adaption! When the hell are those ever good? They're soulless cash grabs shamelessly promoting a crappy mobile game that you never heard of.However! There are exceptions to this rule. I have discovered this show, along with Bahamut Genesis Season 1 (Let's not talk about season 2), both of which are great game adaptions, surprising us all. It sure surprised me. I'll be honest, I've never heard of this game before, nor do I ever plan on playing it, but the anime is actually pretty good.Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst has a comically amazing setup and story for a...game adaption. In fact, it's probably one of the best story lines I've seen in a while. Truly, the pacing and story arcs that chain into one another is extremely well done for a 12 episode series. It manages to weave in a complex mysterious political plot at hand in an empire.Innamuel, one of our main characters gets very naturally caught up in the development of this political plot, and he and the people he meet all are trying to figure out the big picture.What this show does is focus a lot on the story, and less on the characters. This is fine, if the story is well made, which it definitely is. The introductory arc that lets you understand Immanuel's situation and personality is pretty good, and the way they introduce the mysterious of the story and how it eventually makes everyone reach the conclusion is definitely one of the best I've seen. Honestly, the plot is quite simple: it's just the way that the characters have to get this information and get out of bad situations that is hard.This story doesn't deal with episodic arcs. Every single episode is leading to the culmination conclusion, and you get to see visible progress in the investigation and plot at hand. It's delicately made, and brilliantly paced. No screen time is wasted, and every scene is important for either the plot, or necessary character development. It's bold, and it works. There's a lot of stuff that gets crammed into a 12 episode series, and the fact that this ambitious act actually works deserves my praise. The story just flows super naturally, it doesn't seem like there's any forced plot at hand, and there's not much plot armor. Of course, our main characters get out of sticky situations a few times, but it's in the realm of possibility, and it's not frequently done.Of course, the story is good, but what about characters? Honestly, for how little focus there is on character development for all but Immanuel and Leo, it's good. I don't think there's any tropes, and character design is quite good. There's a decent pool of characters that contribute to the story, but nothing too much, and as such, you don't see random people progressing the plot very frequently. Of course, there are arbitrary characters that are introduced to accelerate the plot, but for the most part, the characters that are involved in the story are there to stay, and the chemistry among those characters are good for how little time there is to invest in them. Immanuel is clearly the greatest character of the story: there's a lot of focus on characterizing and developing his personality and motivations. I think his adapting to the situation at hand and maturing is well done, but his motivations are kind of iffy. He does put his life on the line for people he barely knows. Leo's character is rarely explored, but he does have a maturing arc of his own, and it's not that bad. Basically, a bread and butter JP protagonist: loves fighting the weak and has a naïve sense of justice. The others are fine, just not too explored, but the story gives them enough personality for me to like them.Now, the worst part: the worldbuilding. It just doesn't exist. Theres actually NOTHING explained about the world. It seems like technology from the industrial revolution is constantly being used in the series, but architecture is straight from medieval Europe. Magic is used, but infrequently and the magic system is never explained. It seems like most poeple can't use magic, and it's not that strong compared to heavy artillery weapons. But then, there's magic that's used at the conclusion of the series that's absolutely OP. Again, no idea. Lots of things that I would liked to have been explained to me get glanced over, like the coldfire phenomenon or some other things, but honestly, it had to be done, since if there was any world building, the already crammed plot would overflow and the story would be rushed. I'm glad that the story was given the attention that it needed for succcess.Art is decent, some backgrounds are nice, but fighting scenes are all but mediocre. At least CGI isn't really used, but overall, lackluster animation. game adaption. In fact, it's probably one of the best story lines I've seen in a while.

I gave 10 out of 10 on all 6 criteria cause this anime is something that would make your heart pump and be curious about the stories and not just about one particular character.The development of each character is outstanding and the story is something that I highly enjoy.As for the Art, this kind of animation is something that is new to my eyes, that is the first reason why I decided to watch it and when I started I just can\'t stop.The music is also something that is new for me, most anime...these past years have been on the same genre, and hearing this different music is something that I truly enjoyed, it made me feel that ""AOT"" feeling I had when I heard the first OST. It\'s refreshing. And as a music enthusiast, music has a big factor for me when I am deciding when an anime is a Masterpiece or Great.I am hoping for a season 2, I haven\'t researched about the future plans for MWZ but I hope there is a season 2 cause this anime is gonna hunt me for the rest of my life if I didn\'t get a chance to know how their different journeys will collide and end. these past years have been on the same genre, and hearing this different music is something that I truly enjoyed, it made me feel that ""AOT"" feeling I had when I heard the first OST.

That means horrible for MAL standards. MWZ is far from horrible!MWZ started off bad. The first episode gets into action and showcased combat involving swords, guns and magic. Audience expected more explosion and special effects, they always do, but the mages just use their staves/rods as plasma guns and the actual gunners are just storm-trooping each other. Swordfights are okay. The first action sequence was not bad and involved a lot of combatants. Unfortunately, there were two weird cuts that gave off the impression that MWZ is one of those cheap promo anime for video games.First weird...cut is when a melee soldier attacked the viewers and slashed a few times, then he just stops for a second to stare into your soul, then nothing ensues.Second weird cut is when Conrad holds a handgun almost as long as a rifle then shoots a few times, screen cuts to Schaake just chilling beside the car, then she takes a few steps to the left quietly, only to stand and shoot back. I think they forgot to add gun impacts to show that Schaake is dodging Conrad's bullets.These two mishaps only happened in the first episode, which is a crucial episode to impress viewers, and perhaps because of those mishaps, a lot of them were turned away.It is a shame. There are three or more fight scenes after that, and they did not have the same blunder as the first. MWZ's action sequence feels grounded as it involves all of the combatants. None of these characters are overpowered and exceptionally good at fighting. They always struggle in fights, giving a sense of dread. The BGM also builds up tension perfectly without too much volume.Next is character. Good balanced characters. We start off with two main characters, Leocadio the handsome boy with the cool hairstyle, and Innumael the wimpy boy with that yee-yee ass haircut. Guess who gets more screen time? Our real main character is Innumael because his side of the story has more freedom and action. Due to Innumael's wimpy character, he doesn't lead the show. He is just caught in the motions and going along with it. Still, Innumael is quite the talkative person and interacts with the side characters, bringing out more of their voices and personalities. Eventually, Innumael grew on me and the other characters.Leocadio's early role is the cliche military rookie learning the darkness of military, so he was restricted and didn't get much spotlight until later episodes.MWZ manages to introduce a huge amount of characters yet able to make them all memorable and significant. That is a remarkable feat.Last on the list is art and sound.Art is so-so, not much to say. Various settings is traveled in this anime so the background art doesn't getting boring, but it is still oversimplified. Animation is okay. The action sequences are not that flashy. Art melts sometimes.Sound is hard to judge. I'm pretty sure the anime has a huge variety of soundtracks for almost every kind of atmosphere, but they're all too low volume and too ambient to be memorable. The BGM during fight scenes are good. Sound effects are okay and reasonably loud in fights. Voice acting is well done, a lot of veteran voice actors.Ah, what a commercial failure. MWZ might garner more fans if they just sexualize the soul out of Schaake to bait sad virgins like me. There was a scene where Schaake was nailed down by Seitz and the camera angled perfectly to show more boobs, yet her boobs wasn't really drawn that erotically and it ended quickly. To make it worse, because Innumael has that yee-yee ass haircut, he can't get bitches on his dick. So romance route with Schaake is closed. Fanservice is dead.It would also be cool if the combatants can do some sort of breathing style and have glowing special effects around them, then make mages shoot epileptic seizures.Also, what's with the OP? Fucking birdy opera like it's the Food Chain episode of Adventure Times. C'mon man we wanna listen to LiSA singing the same song over and over again! ED is lit though.MWZ's attempt on being a serious show without all those shameless anime tropes is applaudable and entertaining, but it lead to its failure. It is a shame. A true shame.I forgot to talk about the story. The story is excellent, no spoiler? Just Episode 10 spouts a bit too much information to take in. There's no comedy btw. MWZ is a dull ride. The characters are all sad and serious most of the time(except Irma) and although Innumael jokes around occasionally, he isn't that funny. Comedy has been misused in dark anime as a tool to lighten up the mood and keep the audience going. Even Berserk has comedy and nude ladies to keep readers excited.MWZ for whatever reason... refused to sell hot anime girls, refused to do flashy action, refused to hire LiSA to sing another Gurenge and refused to do comedy.Now I am not so baffled anymore. MWZ sits rightfully on 6.5 because anime is a mistake. cut is when a melee soldier attacked the viewers and slashed a few times, then he just stops for a second to stare into your soul, then nothing ensues.Second weird cut is when Conrad holds a handgun almost as long as a rifle then shoots a few times, screen cuts to Schaake just chilling beside the car, then she takes a few steps to the left quietly, only to stand and shoot back. I think they forgot to add gun impacts to show that Schaake is dodging Conrad's bullets.These two mishaps only happened in the first episode, which is a crucial episode to impress viewers, and perhaps because of those mishaps, a lot of them were turned away.It is a shame. There are three or more fight scenes after that, and they did not have the same blunder as the first. MWZ's action sequence feels grounded as it involves all of the combatants. None of these characters are overpowered and exceptionally good at fighting. They always struggle in fights, giving a sense of dread. The BGM also builds up tension perfectly without too much volume.Next is character. Good balanced characters. We start off with two main characters, Leocadio the handsome boy with the cool hairstyle, and Innumael the wimpy boy with that yee-yee ass haircut. Guess who gets more screen time? Our real main character is Innumael because his side of the story has more freedom and action. Due to Innumael's wimpy character, he doesn't lead the show. He is just caught in the motions and going along with it. Still, Innumael is quite the talkative person and interacts with the side characters, bringing out more of their voices and personalities. Eventually, Innumael grew on me and the other characters.Leocadio's early role is the cliche military rookie learning the darkness of military, so he was restricted and didn't get much spotlight until later episodes.MWZ manages to introduce a huge amount of characters yet able to make them all memorable and significant. That is a remarkable feat.Last on the list is art and sound.Art is so-so, not much to say. Various settings is traveled in this anime so the background art doesn't getting boring, but it is still oversimplified. Animation is okay. The action sequences are not that flashy. Art melts sometimes.Sound is hard to judge. I'm pretty sure the anime has a huge variety of soundtracks for almost every kind of atmosphere, but they're all too low volume and too ambient to be memorable. The BGM during fight scenes are good. Sound effects are okay and reasonably loud in fights. Voice acting is well done, a lot of veteran voice actors.Ah, what a commercial failure. MWZ might garner more fans if they just sexualize the soul out of Schaake to bait sad virgins like me. There was a scene where Schaake was nailed down by Seitz and the camera angled perfectly to show more boobs, yet her boobs wasn't really drawn that erotically and it ended quickly. To make it worse, because Innumael has that yee-yee ass haircut, he can't get bitches on his dick. So romance route with Schaake is closed. Fanservice is dead.It would also be cool if the combatants can do some sort of breathing style and have glowing special effects around them, then make mages shoot epileptic seizures.Also, what's with the OP? Fucking birdy opera like it's the Food Chain episode of Adventure Times. C'mon man we wanna listen to LiSA singing the same song over and over again! ED is lit though.MWZ's attempt on being a serious show without all those shameless anime tropes is applaudable and entertaining, but it lead to its failure. It is a shame. A true shame.I forgot to talk about the story. The story is excellent, no spoiler? Just Episode 10 spouts a bit too much information to take in. There's no comedy btw. MWZ is a dull ride.

A well animated and put together actions story with pretty good fights, a plot that has an actual resolution in this season,(Minus a small sequel hook), and a likable MC. For any fan of fantasy actions shows with a fast pace, this is a great watch.If that's not your cup of tea, maybe you won't love it, but for anyone the production quality is visible and pretty impressive.I would say this anime does everything it tries pretty well, with no real flaws.

The animation was well done, and it rarely got iffy.Storyline and plot was great, or had very few flaws to speak of.The characters were lovable, except for that one Captain (You know who I'm talking about Haha).The world building was really good, you're thrown into a fantasy/military/magic mix, but you see no overpowered characters. It's just about one more person in this ever expanding world, making it great for immersion.The key takeaway though, will be the fact that the story ends just as it gets to the climax. You're left wanting to see more, but...you never will find out the mysteries and action that was about to unfold.Plus, the game that this animation was made after was shut down during 2022.So there is really no reason to expect a continuation or season 2.I'll give it a 10/10 for what it could've been. you never will find out the mysteries and action that was about to unfold.Plus, the game that this animation was made after was shut down during 2022.So there is really no reason to expect a continuation or season 2.I'll give it a 10/10 for what it could've been.""]"

I don't mind this stuff, but you should watch at your own discretion.4th episode is Reiri's time. It's sexy bunny time.5th episode is Silvia's episode. If you dislike (or have problem) children or lolis being in lewd position or doing lewd things, then you should avoid this episode.6th episode is massive harem time. Lots of tittties all around. Basically all characters from the show are there and all of them are naked.And now it's time for the ranking from worst to best:Decent:6, Episode Nr.5 - Silvia is cute and all, but I don't want FBI knocking on my door any time soon.5, Episode Nr.1 - Aine's mind is quite perverted.4, Episode Nr.3 - My mind on the other hand is way more perverted than Aine's.Good:3, Episode Nr.2 - Very creative, I liked this episode creativity.OH MY:2.

Ladies versus Butlers!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7148/Ladies_versus_Butlers,"['Many criticize the harem genre of anime for its overly formulaic approach and execution.  And Ladies vs. Butlers will probably not change the opinions of these critics, since practically every convention common in harem anime is crammed into this show.The premise behind Ladies vs. Butlers is simple yet predictable.  The main character, Hino Akiharu, attends a school for upper-class ladies that is also dedicated to instructing maids and butlers how to function in high-class society.  The story basically details Hino interacting with the various girls at the school and the various ecchi situations he gets himself into.  The majority of this...series is episodic and, in all honesty, serves nothing more than to introduce the female characters and to show ecchi scenes.Ladies vs. Butlers includes almost every female archetype found in the harem genre: a tsundere, a childhood friend, a (reverse) trap, lolis, clumsy girls, foreign girls, etc.  The harem lead, Akiharu, is also a fairly generic character.  While he doesn’t fit the “total loser” persona as many other harem leads do, there is nothing really noteworthy about him.  Also, there is hardly any significant character development, but that is to be expected of an anime of this type.The art is decent and very reminiscent of one of XEBEC’s earlier productions, Kanokon.  And while some of the character designs may be slightly off-putting (for example, there is a 19-year-old girl who looks like an elementary school student), this will not detract from overall enjoyment of the anime.The opening and ending songs are appropriate for this kind of anime but nothing all that memorable, and the voice-acting suited each character’s personality well.  The background music is virtually nonexistent, though you will probably be too fixated on all the bouncing breasts, panty shots, and nudity present in this anime to even notice.While Ladies vs. Butlers does not fail in one particular aspect, its main issue is that it does nothing to stand out from the countless other harem anime out there.  It doesn’t deviate from the harem formula at all, and as a result, this anime most likely will not appeal to anyone looking for anything more than fanservice and comedy.  However, if you are a diehard harem or ecchi fan, you should give Ladies vs. Butlers a try.Overall, this was a decent ecchi/harem anime, albeit nothing exceptional or ground-breaking. series is episodic and, in all honesty, serves nothing more than to introduce the female characters and to show ecchi scenes.Ladies vs. Butlers includes almost every female archetype found in the harem genre: a tsundere, a childhood friend, a (reverse) trap, lolis, clumsy girls, foreign girls, etc.  The harem lead, Akiharu, is also a fairly generic character.

In thirty seconds, try and see how many common Ero-game character archetypes you can think of then, see how many of them you can find in Ladies versus Butlers. I did the same thing and found all of them before I was even halfway through episode 1. You name it, they\'ve got it! From tsundere, to clumsy chicks, to childhood friend/tormentor. They even have an OBVIOUS reverse trap who\'s roommates with our main hero and what harem would be complete without  a 19 year old girl who looks like she\'s 10!However, I digress. The truth is Ladies vs. Butlers...is a harem that tries to mash as many cliches(God, I hate that word) of the harem genre into one place, hoping it won\'t just collapse on itself. And while the whole ""Oh crap! I tripped and grabbed your titties"" can be good for a laugh once and a while, devoting an entire episode to it may be crossing the line. Especially when we get to the level of ""Clumsy maid girl falls onto to guy and rubs her cooch on his face"".In terms of story, it\'s the usual deal. Guy transfers to a ""special"" school for butlers, maids, and up and coming ""ojou-samas"", that has an insanely unbalanced ratio of boys to girls because, how are you gonna have a decent harem, when there aren\'t 20 girls to every guy. The music is nothing special and, as I said before, the characters are very ordinary. Things may get better over time but, as things look now, that is very unlikely. is a harem that tries to mash as many cliches(God, I hate that word) of the harem genre into one place, hoping it won\'t just collapse on itself.

Ladies versus Butlers is an ecchi harem comedy that does little to break the chain of ""we don\'t need a story as long there are boobies"" shows that we see in shows of this genre. Almost all the characters fall perfectly within some set archetype, and don\'t really see anything in the way of character development. Also, this show has more of these archetypes than I think I\'ve ever seen in one place, as well all the gags you\'d expect in this genre.Despite this, I still enjoyed this series quite a bit ,...for two main reasons. The main character, and fact that the non-ecchi related jokes were actually funny.Story: Didn\'t really expect anything from the story to begin with, didn\'t really get anything. The show basically just follows him around as he lives at this school with all these girls. No real plot. He\'s just sorta there with all these girls, and.... yeah.Art: The show does look nice, which is definitely a plus. It\'s not incredibly unique in terms of style, but it\'s not bad to look at either. It gets the job done for this series just fine. A show based on fanservice should be something fans would want to look at, no?Sound: Not really anything notable about the sound. The OP was kinda catchy, but that\'s about it. It wasn\'t bad, but it never really stuck out during the series.Character: The show has more character archetypes crammed into it than I\'ve ever seen in any place before, and nobody really develops beyond these roles. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Akuharu. While he\'s no brilliant character himself, I\'d definitely choose him over most of the other male leads you see in ecchi harem. Him not being a spineless loser without any backbone or opinion of any kind was nice change from the usual, and his appearance (red eyes, scar on his eyebrow, and not small/wimpy) felt like someone actually gave it a bit of thought rather than just taking the concept art from another ecchi harem and doing just enough edits to make him not a blatant clone. For the first time, I actually CARED about the male lead. While there\'s still lots of work to be done in terms of characters, L x B was at least a step in the right direction.Enjoyment: While there was more than enough fanservice for those who came here looking for it, the show was quite amusing with its more worksafe bits humor(the principal and ninja maid in particular). It was enough to keep me watching the entire way through, although I really would have liked to see more of it in place of the ""I tripped and grabbed a boob"" gag or the ever present ""Some random situation has forced us into a sexually awkward position"" bit.Overall: Ladies versus Butlers is by no means a greatanime, but it definitely preferrable to most of the shows in this genre.

One of the first characters you meet is a tsundere, next is the childhood-friend/tormenter, followed by a shameless perv and a gay who's too full of himself - just to give you a fraction of the archetypes you'll meet in the...first two episodes. It's possible they'll change during the series, but my first impression isn't too much. - 3/10The story is quite absent in those episodes, only a small part is revealed already but what has unfolded already doesn't promise any high-quality story at all. I could be wrong though, I've already met an anime that managed to pull out quite the story while having an (almost) equally senseless beginning. Who knows what Ladies vs Butlers will bring us? For now, I don't think I'm able to give much either. - 4/10Moving on to the better parts of the series, the art isn't anything special, but does the job it's supposed to do just fine. Considering this still is a comedy, the style is very functional and overall apeasing. This is a score that most likely won't change at all during the broadcast of the show so you can consider it final. - 7/10What I really do like about this anime is the sound. Not only are the OP and the ED very catchy songs on their own, the background music during the series itself is also very nice. FX'es likewise. The voice acting isn't something outstanding, but still good enough as there aren't any negative remarks from me. Again, this isn't something that is prone to changing during the duration of the series so this is final too. - 8/10Last - but not least - is the enjoyment. This is the most important part of the show because it's a comedy - obviously - so I took my time deciding on a score. The show is quite funny, even if it's laughing at the excessive use of clichés. Humor is well-timed and sometimes even manages to come from an unexpected corner. I sincerely hope this won't slack off during the series because that'd be a shame. But since it usually only gets better I gave it quite the respectable score. - 8/10Now, because comedies are supposed to make you laugh and not ponder about amazing character complexity or godlike plot twist, these factors won't be taken into account very much. Because the direct viewing experience is of biggest importance, the other factors - being Art, Sound and most notably Enjoyment - have a much heavier weight on the outcome of the overall score.

While it gives off a Lighthearted feeling. It doesn\'t exactly match the Situations and Scenes. It was like it\'s Forcing the Comedy and Romance Genre to Mix but fails in doing so. it just doesn\'t sit right with me. OP and ED songs were likeable...especially the OP. i at least loved that one!Character (7/10): This! this was one of the few parts that got 7 in the whole review! i mean, Seriously! blah! At least for a Harem Anime it doesn\'t only focus on one or two Character Development. All of them were in the spotlight. Each has their own uniqueness and speciality. Especially The Clumsy Sisters XD Loved them!! Sernia was the perfect High-Class lady with the right amount of Tsundere and Lovely Voice. Tomomi was....err.....weird....i don\'t know if she was a nice person....or just a evil Sadist.....i was just confused at her character.. Daichi!! oh! how could i forget her?? she was the most cutest of all the girls! Especially when she keeps her secret from Akiharu and blushes. Moe Overload.... Well like i said, all of them has equal Roles and Screen Time. though Selina and Saikyou may have the most Screen time..Why should i complain? they were the main Heroine\'s after all. and Lastly, our Perfectly Normal,Delinquent,Dense MC....which is normal for Harem Animes nowadays. at least he\'s not as dense as our MC in IS: Infinite Stratos right? so it\'s all ok!Enjoyment (7/10): Can\'t say i was dissatisfied with the Enjoyment. The Comedy of the Anime made me laugh a few times so i enjoyed it at least. And i\'ll admit that i like Ecchi Genre\'s, So the Uncensored Shots with the Oppai\'s and Nude Bodies didn\'t Make me feel bored either.Overall (6/10) : Yes, Overall i Enjoyed the Anime with it\'s Jokes and Little Romance. But was a little dissapointed with a few things. So can\'t say i liked the anime...it was more of like a Time-Passer one. it\'s not really one of those anime\'s where you can watch them again and again and never get tired of it. It was just One-Go.This is my 5th Review in MAL and My 1st Review in a Harem,Ecchi Anime. sorry if i missed a few parts in my review but please point them out so that i can study and recorrect them when i make another review in the near future. Thanks! either on his Face or on his Crotch.... for a Harem Anime this one was rather weak...Lol was there any plot at all?? NO! NO Sir! sure there is one thing about the story...like Akiharu\'s parents died and his only choice was to become a butler, but if you are looking for a Anime with Epic Sword Fighting or Lovely and Cute Romance.......Better pack your ""Excalibur"" and go to a place far away or you will regret it and just start blabbering and complaining about how crappy the anime is....and for the ones who LOVE Oppai,Nude Bodies,Lolies,Oppai and More Oppai......Just sit back,Unzip your fly and Do a little ""Spanking the Monkey"".Art (6/10): Art was nothing special......one problem to complain about though...The DEM OPPAI\'S!! i mean dafuq?? for a Boob themed anime where did the boobs get pulled out from? Cow Ass? omg.....just look at Tomomi\'s boobs.....they were so soggy and long they reached the lower part of the chest....i was like ""ugh, is this even......"". At least animation was decent.

But I just got a hold of the pre-release episode of Ladies versus Butlers!I have been watching anime since the 80's and have enjoyed various types growing up.  For the past few years I have really enjoyed comedies.Ladies versus Bulters! started me off with a pretty good laugh.  I must warn you that it is ecchi.  So for those who enjoy a good ecchi comedy, then you are in luck.  I can not say how much I will like this show...until I watch a few episodes.  As it stands I enjoyed the first.Hopefully this will kick off the winter with a handful of good animes. until I watch a few episodes.  As it stands I enjoyed the first.Hopefully this will kick off the winter with a handful of good animes."", ""now this series is the worse romance anime i watched for the year 2010 so far. it had a bad start with the first episode throwing so many ecchi cliches that you will be facepalming yourself every 2 minutes. even though the series get a little better as it goes on i still have a bad taste in my mouth from watching the first episode.the story about a guy who looks like a bad kid going to a school populated by mostly girl would catch an eye romantic anime fan like me but it fail due to the poor execution.i do say it does get...better but only better than the last episode which were not that great to begin with. the art is a matter of personal opinion. the animator try to create a new look for anime characters but to me they failed. since it is mostly the eyes that creep me out. i don't know maybe it because i like the old eye with a white spot in the corner of the eye.the voice acting was decent and all the voice actor did their best to match their characters. now character which i have to say is the most important in any show. many of the characters are either cliches or dull with the exception of  Akiharu and Tomomi who were actually likable characters.now i did not enjoy this anime because of its horrible start, characters animation, and cliches characters. another thing i did not enjoy was the fan-service in the episode since it show girls naked talking about crap i couldn't read since i was looking at something else.now this anime i think is made for a person who really likes his ecchi anime but if you really want to watch anime ecchi anime i recommend Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan or to love ru since these are better that watching this.overall: 5 better but only better than the last episode which were not that great to begin with. the art is a matter of personal opinion. the animator try to create a new look for anime characters but to me they failed. since it is mostly the eyes that creep me out. i don't know maybe it because i like the old eye with a white spot in the corner of the eye.the voice acting was decent and all the voice actor did their best to match their characters. now character which i have to say is the most important in any show. many of the characters are either cliches or dull with the exception of  Akiharu and Tomomi who were actually likable characters.now i did not enjoy this anime because of its horrible start, characters animation, and cliches characters. another thing i did not enjoy was the fan-service in the episode since it show girls naked talking about crap i couldn't read since i was looking at something else.now this anime i think is made for a person who really likes his ecchi anime but if you really want to watch anime ecchi anime i recommend Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan or to love ru since these are better that watching this.overall: 5"", 'Well this is my first review i have ever made publicly... I\'m not an expert at every anime style or every genre but ive have taken a like to these kind of romantic comedies recently. Very basic and fun anime to watch i would say, with the typical echinnes these types of anime\'s  got, the childhood friend, the stubborn rich girl, the petite girls, etc, etc, and the clueless protagonist which seem to never notice the feelings from the girls that are actually interested on him. I felt that the story was very typical and predictable (I believe that many people who watches these...kind of anime\'s can agree with that) but non the less interesting and attractive. The style and characters reminded me to another anime called Kanokon... and i later found they were produced by the same studio... lol This means very nice colors and many close shots of the girls faces and ""cough"" body parts ""cough"" Although predictable and kind of familiar to other anime\'s some characters can be surprising and some times ""Scary"" so it makes for a few more laughs at some times. Overall i think an 8 is a nice score for this anime because either way you see it these types of ""harem"" animes, together with the animation and plot, always brings good times and a few laughs to the viewer.Hope you guys like it and understand my opinion =) kind of anime\'s can agree with that) but non the less interesting and attractive.

Any *plot* connoisseur will appreciate the wide variety of *plot* options on display here, including small side dishes of *plot* and mammoth, quivering *plots* with assorted sauces from tea to hot spring water. Some of the *plot* helpings are actually so generous you might even be like ""wow I really like *plots* with my anime, but this is a LOT more than I expected!""But more importantly--for me anyway--is that LvB has charm, sharp and comedic animation, and a catchy theme song that almost...made me not skip the intro every time (almost!). I always complain about genre-shifting, and while LvB teases the romantic drama angle towards the latter episodes it never fully crosses the line. There are gags and goofs quite literally to the end of the series which I entirely appreciate.Aforementioned gags and goofs are 99% about boobs and/or groping, but hilarious facial animations make it all a joke rather than slanting it into rapey scenarios. There\'s rarely a dull moment here! I also rather enjoy the worldbuilding because it demonstrates real effort was put into the writing rather than starting with boob jokes and working from there. Overall, LvB is not a serious anime whatsoever, and I totally understand why people don\'t like it, but for me it was a breeze of levity that most ""comedies"" fail to grasp. made me not skip the intro every time (almost!).

It\'s not particularly bad, but then it\'s not particularly good either.  Expect lots of nudity and a few hilarious moments, but no real redeeming qualities otherwise.Story: 4A school designed specifically to reinforce the hereditary social hierarchy.  If you\'re from an upper class family, you come here to learn how to be prim and proper.  If you\'re from a servant class family, you come here to learn how to be properly subservient to...your betters.  (Can you tell I\'m cynical?)  Fortunately, the anime doesn\'t really hit you over the head with it, like for example in They Are My Noble Masters.  The school is just the setting, and the show is about humorous goings-on at the school.Art: 4The style isn\'t as clean as in some others, and something kind of bugs me about the character designs of the girls.  I guess they\'re meant to be ""voluptuous"" but to me they just come across as chubby.  Upon watching it a second time, I figured it out.  It\'s most obvious on Flameheart.  Her waist is too high, which makes her look like she has big hips.  It\'s not quite as pronounced on the other girls, but it\'s still there.  Also, I really don\'t like her ""drill hair,"" but the fact that they turned it into a running gag keeps it from losing another point.Sound: 5The theme song is fun and catchy, although not my favorite.  The voice acting and incidental sounds are fine.Characters: 5I\'ll be honest, there\'s nothing special about these characters.  They\'re your standard harem anime characters.  I don\'t like Saikyo\'s sadistic streak (worst childhood friend ever!), or Flameheart\'s snobbishness, but neither bugs me enough to lose a point.  The principal is funny, and it would have gained an extra point if she played a larger role.The hero is not one of the two harem anime stereotypes: the misunderstood good guy or the admitted pervert.  He\'s not the pervert everyone thinks he is, but he\'s no ""poor me"" whiny brat either.  He gives as well as he takes, as evidenced by his insubordinate attitude toward his betters, such as his banter with Flameheart.  She gets the better of him as often as he gets the better of her, but his ""I don\'t give a damn"" attitude makes him particularly likable.I do have one complaint, which is that I really don\'t like any of the girls.  Part of the fun of a harem anime comes from choosing your favorite girl, but in this case, I think the hero is better off without any of them.  The two main rivals, Flameheart and Saikyo, are each unlikable.  The other girls are mostly forgettable.Normally I would consider this a huge failing in a harem anime, but for some reason, it doesn\'t bother me too much here.  The show is entertaining despite a lack of sympathetic characters.Enjoyment: 6It\'s just plain fun to watch.  Don\'t expect anything deep or awe-inspiring, and don\'t even expect any particularly interesting characters.Overall: 5If you\'re into perverted comedies, you have to watch this one just to check it off your list.

Otherwise, skip it.', ""As others have mentioned, LvB is a very fanservicey, ecchi harem anime with lots of romantic comedy, perverted misunderstandings, and yes, lots and lots of oppai.  This will probably turn some people off immediately, while others will just go watch it because of the boobs.  The show is definately fap-worthy, but it is more than just a show of oversized, bouncing oppai (there's some small-breasted girls too, heehee ;p).  Japanese comedy often falls flat to me, but LvB doesn't overdo the 'beat up and abuse the main hero for comedic effect' gag that so many anime 'comedies' never get past.  There's...plenty of ecchi humor throughout, the girls are hot, and there's even a reverse-trap (girl pretending to be a boy) for variety.I'd recommend it if you like perverted humor and/or topless anime girls, but if those things turn you off, go elsewhere.  8/10 plenty of ecchi humor throughout, the girls are hot, and there's even a reverse-trap (girl pretending to be a boy) for variety.I'd recommend it if you like perverted humor and/or topless anime girls, but if those things turn you off, go elsewhere.  8/10"", ""Finish watching Ladies vs Butlers and not realizing that i already finish all 12 episode just like thatIt ends so sudden that you wanna watch for more but if only your a fan of Ecchi & RomCom with lots of fan service.

'cause the whole point of this anime is for the male fans 'cause it has a lot of fan service i mean a lot basically the whole season is about fan service and they just added a little bit of romance and one more thing the ending was messed up they should do a season 2 of ladies vs butlers so that will know what happens next. female lead was outstanding with their role as a Tsundere and a Sadistic but our male main protagonist is your typical average guy making all the girls fall for him with his bad boy looks but good on the inside and even there's no main plot at all you can easily keep up with the story.The only downfall for me is that the boobs was uncensored it kinda distract me while watching the anime but if you like boobs being uncensored and totally this anime is for you.

I chuckled the first time and then I stopped chuckling after the 3rd one in the same episode. Upon watching the second episode, I thought they showed us tits because they knew episode 1 was a flop. Without fail, we got tits on every episode after that. I love some tig ol\' biddies, but you can\'t run a show off of those alone. And they knew how to compensate for all the huge tits. I like me some small titties as...well, but I don\'t care too much for girls that look like a dolled up 10 year old boy. It is a little creepy, at the very least, seeing the tits of a girl that looks like she belongs in grade school. Then saying she is the oldest one doesn\'t make that alright. It is still not cool.This anime has a few off topic things worth mentioning. I have never seen a lack of facial features consistent throughout an entire series. Noses are not optional, we need them. The main character is the first delinquent without a personality. I love how delinquents are always given a decent personality because they have more freedom with their character. This was clearly not the case with  Akiharu. This is also the first time I have ever seen a few episodes subbed and then decided to swap out to the dub version. There comes a time where you say ""fuck it, we are doing it live"" and change to the dub because you know the show can\'t get any worse. This is the first time I ever felt bad for a voice actor. They got some people who seemed sleep deprived and asked them to read the entire script in one sitting and record it. Money is money and we all like food and shiny things.With all the bitching I have done, I still give the show a 4. It is bad. There wasn\'t anything that particularly pissed me off. The show was a generic boob and scoot. This strikes me as a show that I will show my 13 year old son and he will love anime because of it. When he asks me about women and their bodies, this will be a worthwhile instructional show. I will get my ass kicked by my wife if/when she finds out.

And yeah, this was certainly one of the dumbest shows I watched. You know that really fucking dumb trope where the guy and girl fall and they somehow end up on top of eachother and he accidentally holds her boob (It’s really entertaining sometimes because the position they fall in make it physically impossible for them to be in that position but I digress)? Yeah so that happens at least 5 times an episode. Maybe not that specific thing over and over again but things like him...walking in on them changing or falling and looking up their skirts. In the first fucking episode he’s running around the school and does that with every single female character in the school. That’s when I knew I was in for some hot garbage. The characters are bland and cliche, you got the tsundere love interest whose personality doesn’t dare stem beyond that. The scheming girl who I’ll get to later. The guy that’s actually a girl. The foreign rapist (she’s cute though so it’s ok apparently) and her foreign body guard who definitely has killed someone and is planning on killing more. The cliche aloof girls, one who is always tripping (it gets old before the first time) and her sister who just strips at random moments (have I mentioned this is an ecchi?). The perverted butler, the loli who’s totally of legal age because people need an excuse to be weird. The perverted principle and her hardass assistant. The princess who’s just an otaku and the main character who would’ve been a cool asshole but only actually has one retort for one specific character. I hate this cast. It’s lazy and they're only there to show anime tits and pretend they’re being funny. They hinted that the scheming childhood friend is a bully but we don’t actually see her do anything. She apparently had a crush on the tsundere but wait a minute, she isn’t the protagonist so that can’t be it. All the characters just have a crush on the main character because he’s the only guy that’s not an active sexual predator (I think. It’s honestly up for debate). Really this show only exists because people like seeing naked anime girls. They aren’t even attractive, the tsundere has the dumbest haircut I’ve ever seen. It was dumb and stupid, but boy did I have a lot of fun making fun of it. It’s bad, but it’s ironically enjoyable. I had so much fun and laughed my ass off. It technically deserves to be lower but it did what I wanted it to and entertained me. walking in on them changing or falling and looking up their skirts.

The foreign rapist (she’s cute though so it’s ok apparently) and her foreign body guard who definitely has killed someone and is planning on killing more. The cliche aloof girls, one who is always tripping (it gets old before the first time) and her sister who just strips at random moments (have I mentioned this is an ecchi?). The perverted butler, the loli who’s totally of legal age because people need an excuse to be weird. The perverted principle and her hardass assistant. The princess who’s just an otaku and the main character who would’ve been a cool asshole but only actually has one retort for one specific character. I hate this cast. It’s lazy and they're only there to show anime tits and pretend they’re being funny. They hinted that the scheming childhood friend is a bully but we don’t actually see her do anything. She apparently had a crush on the tsundere but wait a minute, she isn’t the protagonist so that can’t be it. All the characters just have a crush on the main character because he’s the only guy that’s not an active sexual predator (I think. It’s honestly up for debate). Really this show only exists because people like seeing naked anime girls. They aren’t even attractive, the tsundere has the dumbest haircut I’ve ever seen. It was dumb and stupid, but boy did I have a lot of fun making fun of it. It’s bad, but it’s ironically enjoyable. I had so much fun and laughed my ass off. It technically deserves to be lower but it did what I wanted it to and entertained me."", ""very cool funny and ECCHİ anime if u love these kinds u found itit's about a highschooler who is Akiharu Hino he transfers to a school a very different one than others.there is two clas of students that given education one of them is upper-ed there the rich girls and a boy(gay i think :D) that given education and the other one is servant-ed there they train how to be a butler or a maid so the main protagonist Akiharu Hino starts to take education there but there is many many hardships awaiting for him like his childhood friend Tomomi Saikyo she is one...of a killer and there is Selnia Iori Flameheart she kinda starts to fall in love with Akiharu.it's very fun to watch it's comedy scenes is cool to and it's ecchi it's something i can't tell u guys u must live it :Dstory: it's interesting and cool 10art: very very good 10sound: good 10character:all of them are uniqe 10enjoyment:great 10overall: 10 of a killer and there is Selnia Iori Flameheart she kinda starts to fall in love with Akiharu.it's very fun to watch it's comedy scenes is cool to and it's ecchi it's something i can't tell u guys u must live it :Dstory: it's interesting and cool 10art: very very good 10sound: good 10character:all of them are uniqe 10enjoyment:great 10overall: 10"", 'Oh lord, where to begin... let\'s see... Interesting at points, weird at other points... overall it\'s one giant Echii-palooza.My first reaction to watching this was ""What the heck did I just get myself into?"". That was only the first episode. Over time, it got better, funnier, and a lot more perverted, trust me. As an Anime Expert, I know a good echii show when I see one. It\'s got everything you could think of; bath houses, hot springs, hotel rooms, closets, beaches, and in an entire school with like 3 guys and 400 girls, you know it\'ll be interesting to watch.The story was interesting, normal...guy moving to a school to learn how to be a butler, and what really made me think, was when he got every girl in the school to try and kill him after one little mistake: landing on top of a girl. She freaks out, runs off with her chasing him, stumbles on top of another girl, then another, and another... next thing you know it, there are a whole bunch of Amazons coming after him. That made me laugh. They all work it out in the end, but for a while, it looked like the end of the show for him.Art, what you would find in a normal anime made these days, well done.Sound, good character voices, matches them fairly well, but now we gotta see how english dubs will fair.Characters, lovable, annoying, crazy... a variety.Enjoyment... a solid 6. I didn\'t enjoy it as much as I could have if they had changed a few things. If you\'ve seen it and agreed with pretty much everything I\'ve said so far, you know what I mean.Overall, this was just an anime that had crossed my eyes and I had clicked on episode 1-12.

And this has the best colour and animation I\'ve seen, This is *strictly* one reason why it is a 7. Compare it with Mahou Sensei Negima to get what I mean. The story is kinda like a dunno-why-girls-jump-at-guy harem that never gets resolved. Watch it for enjoyment.[Mood: Light for near-all episodes][Explained notable pickings:]Ecchi: Lots of see-thru underwear and naked bodies, dun worry, there\'s lots of it. Not all episodes though, sometimes a lot sometimes none. [6-7/10]Enjoyment:Well, to be honest, most of the laughs came with ecchi....There were a few touching moments to boot too, and it is quite well-rounded entertainment, but leaning to ecchi. [8/10]Harem: Typical. Girls fall in love with same guy cause of soem cheap kindness or a favour done. No resolution done for any girls in harem except the 2 mains. [4/10]Character varsity: A lot. Like someone mentioned in a review, count how many typical characters you can see in 1st episode and it\'ll probably exceed *a few*. Not to mention the rest. But... little character development spoils the characters.[4/10]Potential wasted: This is one controversial problem. What was the manga like? I dunno. But Asu no Yoichi the anime was great, much better than manga (I put it on hold aft a few chapters, couldn\'t continue). Cos this anime seems to trap itself in a harem net it couldn\'t untangle. Girls who fell in love with guy disappeared completely sometimes for a few episodes, then reappear. If it was like something like Princess Lover!, it could have much more potential. [7-8/10]Story:6Here and there. No plot at all. Seems to just show us school life at a Ladies-Maids-Butlers school and have harem thrown in. The ending was a big fluke, and the last episodes seem to culminate in a ""trough"", the opposite of a climax. Harem was hopelessly unresolved, which was pathetic. Some things were resolved, though, credits to that. Like the rivalry-love fight between he 2 main gal characters.Btw some episodes seem focused on one character, while some were purposefully ecchi (to the point of being ridiculously funny). Tons of fanservice that derail main mood.Art:9Colour was very good, animation was very smooth, ecchi was expressed very well and so on. Scenery was good too, unlike Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu (?), and shades were nicely done.Only complaint about art is that it does not have a 3D concept and probably some characters seem pretty similar, facial expressions were not significantly memorable.Sound:6Didn\'t really take notice of ED. OP the lyrics were good and tune was catchy. Can\'t remember much of sound effects and bgm, although I\'m quite sure they are not great (or else I should have remembered).Character:6Some characters that get introduced for 1 or more episodes get thrown away pretty often. Character personalities were pretty stable except last few episodes, where a very clumsy girl suddenly becomes strong and very steady (she\'s the *VERY* clumsy type).Very little character development in any character, by the end I still wondered what is the main guy\'s character like. He seemed to be led on by various circumstances and was just using typical responses, so nothing special was noted about him other than the very cliche ""kind"". Plus his past has a lot of potential, but was not delved into. Wasted.Enjoyment:8Ecchi to the point where it becomes funny. Some touching moments and slower parts. Well, to be sure I was ""mindlessly"" enjoying myself. It was not about plot but I managed to successfully watch all 12 episodes, which is good already :D.Overall:7Watch it if you are feeling down or something.

Call that a story? I call it a piece of junk that does not have a single...aspect of originality in it.Speaking of originality; it is almost as if the writer just stole a bunch of cliched ideas and bunched them together to form this anime.There is the ""fall down and grab boobs"" cliche (I swear to god that this was repeated at least twice in every episode.)Then there is the ""clumsy girl falls on MC [in awkward position]"" cliche which happened about 6 times in the whole anime.There is also the ""drunk guy/girl who tries to harass (sexually) someone from the other sex then wakes up and forgets"" cliche ( though to be honest it only happened once.)Jeez a random seven year old child could has a better imagination!Anyways, then t here is the regular hot spring episode and the list of these copied scenes go on and on.________________Characters ________________________I was not exaggerating when I mentioned that the story does not have an aspect of originality in it, well the same goes for the characters. There is the violent, large-breasted,  tsundere girl. Then there is the childhood friend who takes pleasure in tormenting the protagonist characater.Dear me! I almost forgot that even the main character is of the ""dense, delinquent-looking but actually nice"" stereotypical main character.Out of the minors there is the clumsy girl, the foreign girl, the loli girl, and that list also goes on and on._________________Fan service________Honestly this subtopic is probably what pissed me the most about this anime. Virtually every 40 seconds, a panty shot is shown out of nowhere. I am honestly not the biggest ecchi fan but I still believe in doing this in moderation. Another problem is this anime\'s obsession with showing the changing girls. Like there is no damn conversation going on, no damn thoughts, no important places, so why bother showing them??? Just to kill time because the plot does not provide enough material to do otherwise.I need not to point out that the amount of nudity shown is insane. Like there is a race and out of nowhere a girl starts stripping with the excuse that ""sometime it feels like the clothes want to be off."" Another scene where useless nudity is shown is where a girl wishes to express her feelings towards the main character so she ties him to the bed and climbs on him naked.It is useless- no amount of fan service can hnde the fact that the plot is to weak to support more than three episodes at maximum._________________Enjoyment___________________The comedy was horrible. Actually it was not so bad in the first three episodes but from there on it kept descending. The enjoyment factor is probably what score this anime the most- it has a lot of fan service. A lot of (in my opinion) useless fan service. So ecchi fans if you are interested in seeing a guy grope a girl\'s breast or watching girls change please go on.

Thank you immensely for your feedback.', ""[Spoiler Alert]Ladies versus Butlers! (2010)Well, that was not how I expected the show to finish off. Was at least a continuation type ending. A second season would have actually been welcome but then its been 10 years.The story is actually not very unique in that it doesn't differ massively from Shomin Sample except more guys and a different set up with the maids. The underlying story is mostly the same. The show here is pushed as a harem but I don't really see anything to push itself as a harem until about episode 9. Although girls can be seen to like the male protagonist...they are however very subtle compared to normal harem shows. That in its self is not bad considering most of the girls are ladies. I would have liked to have seen more of the maids perhaps like the protagonist considering they aren't supposed to be as delicate in nature as the ladies.The art is a good standard, it does drop at times which is unfortunate. The comedic faces are done very well that require lower quality to express emotion but there are times when faces, for example, look at an upwards angle with the camera looking down and you see pretty rigid lines which are a shame. Overall, it is a good standard, however.The OP and ED are both enjoyable. Voices in Japanese are very well done. General sounds and background noise are also a good standard.Characters are pretty varied. They fill in a fair few tropes but some more unusual.The headmaster of the school is a really fun otaku who has a strict maid. This makes for an enjoyable showing from them.Generally, the servant-ed girls under the maid uniforms are awesome because french maid outfits are just the best clothing ever made for women in my opinion.We do have a trap that is pretty obvious as the viewer. You only have one person though unconfirmed that knows the truth during the show. I had looked forward to it being exposed but it is played differently.Our loli character who is actually 19 is pretty great from start to finish and with her combined with the foreign princess who is otaku they make for a great pair.The clumsy maid and her sister also are pretty good. Especially since they follow the fallen from grace cycle. From the falling over to randomly stripping you know, they are going to be fun when you see them.An unusual character was the random pink-haired guy that appears. He is pretty funny if not insanely random.The most unusual of the characters for me in this was the Arabian princess and her maid. In episode 4 it made for a very interesting situation had the protagonist has gone for it he could have had a harem in the culture of following more than one wife. It could have made for a pretty good way to actually have a workable harem. She is the only girl thus far who actually openly admitted her feelings properly and directly.Down to the main three with have Selnia a noble with a crazy hairstyle. I didn't really enjoy her hair until the latter jokes were played on with it. Initially, it just looked stupid. She is the 100% tsundere character who has never been told she is the wrong character until the MC shows up which then has the expected result.The MC Akiharu who looks like a delinquent but actually is just unlucky made for a pretty good protagonist. He does, however, follow the no matter how obvious a female feeling is put forward he struggles to recognise. I can give him a slight break in this show since most of the girls go very round about it.Finally, we have Tomomi who is a prankster and somewhat sadistic. The faces shes makes are wonderful and I love her as a character. One thing the show nearly did and I honestly thought they were going to do it in episode 8 was the situation go south. Unfortunately to an extent, she has been let off her behaviour with the MC completely. I had thought the MC was going to fall out with her over her pranks going too far for too long to create a storyline of her changing to get her love rekindled correctly. Unfortunately, they went the cheap way where the MC doesn't understand girls but suddenly still by accident forgives her for everything with no consequence. Another missed dynamic.In the end, the show was funny and a slice of life. It is very ecchi and does have romance but the harem side of it just is not that strong. It was more girls crushing than being actively harem like.

That\'s an old cliche we are all used to. The only original thing about it is that it\'s a ladies and maids/butlers school. It seems a little too fantasy, but you get used to it. It\'s actually quite fun to see how they are teached differently, and there\'s some mild society...critics deep in there. I mean, really deep. The end is predictable. Fair story.Art [07/10]: Almost nothing to complain about. The art is cute and good, clothes and scenario are really nice. Some hairs are weird [Flamehart\'s is the most crazy one XD] but you get used to it too [specially because the characters themselves make fun of them]. Sometimes boobs are a bit too big, and faces/feet are a bit weird, but overall it\'s quite decent, pleasant art.Sound [10/10]: I absolutely LOVED the songs, they placed the mood really well. OP and ED are great, they have nice beats and good voices! There were some great seiyuus involved in this, so there couldn\'t go wrong, they made a great job.Character [08/10]: There\'s almost no character development. Only Flameheart and Tomomi make some serious breakthrough during the series. But the characters are funny and cute, so I enjoyed them. I tend to like the dark haired girls, but this time I really went for Flameheart, she\'s cute and her hair is awesomely weird XD go doriruu!!~~ I also fell in love with Ayse and Pina. I\'m sure you\'ll find a least one character that you\'ll like, they\'re all very different, funny and interesting.Enjoyment [08/10]: There was a lot of discussions and posts in Sankaku Complex about the explicit ecchi content of this series. I enjoy ecchi, and I think it was well done. I laughed a lot and was touched by some characters, I enjoyed it. I\'ve seen lots of animes like this, but watched all the episodes, so yay for it 8D I\'m really picky.Overall [08/10]: It\'s not the first time you see an anime like this, I think it\'s a ""can\'t go wrong"" formula. If you like animes with this genre, go for it, it\'s a pleasant story. The end of the series is totally expected, but it\'s part of the old ""formula"" thing. Ecchi is quite good, it gets to almost every fetish you guys may have. As an ecchi fan, I liked it. So, if you have an afternoon with nothing to do, and want to watch some light, funny and hot anime, get into LadiesxButlers. If you don\'t like ecchi, or want complexed characters/etc, please don\'t even bother watching it. critics deep in there. I mean, really deep. The end is predictable.

Only Flameheart and Tomomi make some serious breakthrough during the series. But the characters are funny and cute, so I enjoyed them. I tend to like the dark haired girls, but this time I really went for Flameheart, she\'s cute and her hair is awesomely weird XD go doriruu!!~~ I also fell in love with Ayse and Pina. I\'m sure you\'ll find a least one character that you\'ll like, they\'re all very different, funny and interesting.Enjoyment [08/10]: There was a lot of discussions and posts in Sankaku Complex about the explicit ecchi content of this series. I enjoy ecchi, and I think it was well done. I laughed a lot and was touched by some characters, I enjoyed it. I\'ve seen lots of animes like this, but watched all the episodes, so yay for it 8D I\'m really picky.Overall [08/10]: It\'s not the first time you see an anime like this, I think it\'s a ""can\'t go wrong"" formula. If you like animes with this genre, go for it, it\'s a pleasant story. The end of the series is totally expected, but it\'s part of the old ""formula"" thing. Ecchi is quite good, it gets to almost every fetish you guys may have. As an ecchi fan, I liked it. So, if you have an afternoon with nothing to do, and want to watch some light, funny and hot anime, get into LadiesxButlers. If you don\'t like ecchi, or want complexed characters/etc, please don\'t even bother watching it.', ""I'll get the obvious bit out first.Yes, this anime is the most basic formulaic ecchi/harem anime out there. There should be no surprise there.This is a key fact which I'm using as a base for this review. It doesn't make sense to treat this anime any more seriously.Let's start off with the characters. You already know them if you've watched any ecchi anime ever. They are just as basic as the show itself, presenting commonly seen behaviors and personalities. There is nothing interesting about them other than their figure. I won't dwell on it any longer because this is to be expected from the statement...I made earlier.The concept was definitely something different. This anime is set in some kind of Maid/Butler/Noble lady training school. I can at least give them props for that since it's the only thing that stands out at all. There isn't anything particularly unique about the OST or the atmosphere either.Art style and fan service. Okay, this is something they did well. If you're here to beat yo dick, this anime will serve you well with very unnecessary ecchi scenes in almost every episode. I really liked Selnia's design with the drill looking hair no matter how ridiculous it may be. The ecchi scenes were pretty nice as well, which just barely pushes the anime to make it worth watching at least.As for the comedy... it's a mixed bag. I personally didn't find anything funny in it, but it does have some decent enough attempts at comedy that don't ALL rely on ecchi. The recurring gags got old VERY fast, and soon it was almost annoying to see that gag again since they were never funny to begin with. This is entirely subjective of course.Overall, did I enjoy this anime? No. I feel like I wasted my time.But does this anime deserve such a harsh critique?No. This is because such anime isn't made for stellar fleshed out characters with masterful storytelling. It's there to give you heaps and heaps of fan service. If you're into the whole maid fetish, then it's got heaps of that too.This anime doesn't take any risks with trying to be different and is very much content blending in with the mass. However, for those who watch Ecchi anime for...well, the ecchi and don't expect anything more, this anime absolutely delivers in that aspect and that aspect only.So, if you fit that, go ahead and give it a watch.

An epic battle between the two different sexes of servants, or something unlikely like a harem love triangle? Well, the title is pretty irrelevant to what the anime offers.As I watched this anime through the very end, I found myself annoyed of how much fanservice appears very, VERY frequently. Too much, that it was unbearable to watch most of the time. I'm not much for fanservice, but those who appreciate it, will be well satisfied. The story is pretty in-and-out, like I mentioned before, it's a love triangle, but some episodes are character intros and more fanservice.The...only good thing, that I would give this a fair score, would be some comedic moments that gave me a smirk or a grin. It's pretty well executed and you'll know once you've watch the first episode.So, overall, it's a pretty fair anime. Not something I would rewatch, but if you want to watch a new harem this year, I'd put this in your list. only good thing, that I would give this a fair score, would be some comedic moments that gave me a smirk or a grin.

Besides that, the only really annoying parts of this show, which can be found in about 99% of anime because, well, anime logic, are the girls with ridiculously big curly hair, 19 year olds that look and act like 6 year olds, and the infamous ""when in an intense sexual situation, lets snap out of it and try to say something inspirational in an annoying caring tone"".That aside, it was fun to watch.  The audio and art was fine, though the eyes left a lot...to be desired as they all look dead.  The anime food looks nice and the structures are done nicely. to be desired as they all look dead.  The anime food looks nice and the structures are done nicely.', ""Hey folks, this will be a review for Ladies versus Butlers!. This show is a harem, ecchi, slice of life, generic piece of work. If you don't like those things then you shouldn't watch this show. That being said its not terrible. It doesn't excite me like other harems, and even though there was a host of wonderful women didn't feel like it was anything special or interesting.The story revolves around our male main character Hino, Akiharu. Hino transfers into a school which is split between maids/butlers and the upper class ladies. As I'm not super into maids this is already a boring plot line...but whatever. When he transfers in he is mistaken for a delinquent and as such most of the girls fear him. This is how we meet our token Tsundere, along with a childhood friend who is the schemer. Hino then try's to fit in to his new role as a butler in this school.This has been done in other shows and handled vastly better than ladies versus butlers. I don't want to give the impression that I hate generic themes or anything, because I love a generic harem(including this one). However if your looking for this to be refreshing, new, or otherwise well conceived you will be upset. Hino doesn't really fit the butler role, though they do give up trying to make the butler and maid image their flagship image. We spend most of the story showing the good qualities of Hino and exposing some of the secrets our harem full of ladies have. Of course nothing is decided by the end of the anime. Though I will give them props for not forcing some dramatic event that seem to plague shows like this.The art was decent. Someone in the comments pointed out the girls sometimes don't have noses and that bugged me because I couldn't stop noticing it. Soundtrack was cute and not bad.The characters were decent enough and each girl had a charm of her own. Our two main female leads were Flameheart, Sernia Iori and Saikyou, Tomomi. Iori is your typical tsundere, who spends most of the anime giving Hino shit and slowly falling in love with him. Tomomi is the childhood friend who likes to scheme and pick on everyone. These two remind me of Boku wa Tomadachi which IMO was an excellent anime so give that a watch if you like that kind of rivalry. Anyway our side characters are the interesting ones. I cant put them all down because there is an extensive list. Most of them have interesting personality and I rooted for most of them.I enjoyed this show. It was funny at times and the girls all grabbed my attention. The art was a little dated and the ecchi wasn't very titillating. The ending was bland, didn't really inspire much interest. I guess you could say that's how the rest of the anime felt. This was just a mediocre anime over all. However, If you like harems and you have nothing to watch this isn't terrible, its a quick and enjoyable fix for those that like this type of anime. but whatever.

After 4 years I still think I have never laughed so hard and smiled so wide as with this anime. The reason isn't because I'm a pervert, but This just made me so happy "", 'A very entertaining anime. From the first episode itself, you can already tell what anime this is going to be. Didn\'t expect much from this, but I ended up really liking this. To the point of wanting a second season for this anime.The premise of this anime is very interesting. A unique type of school in anime is pretty common, but it\'s usually full of magic and fantasy/futuristic stuff, so this was an interesting twist. A school about butlers and maids in itself is interesting, but the way it is done here is amazing. The story itself is a bit lackluster, as there isn\'t much...to build in the world. Of course, this makes sense, as it takes place entirely in one environment, and its main focus is on the characters, not the world. This anime is very comedic, and you can tell that they knew what they were doing. From entertaining interaction to suggestive wordplay and camera shots, all the way to perfect cuts, this anime is very good on that part. This anime is also very lewd, but it is done well. It\'s not just done for the sake of eye candy (although it is eye candy nonetheless) but is done in a way that helps aid the story and characters. Ashamed to say that the titties distracted me sometimes, but only because they\'re so well animated for no reason.Speaking of characters, this anime has a strong cast. Everything about these characters is amazing, and seeing them in action is even better. They all have their own unique personalities and quirks that help each of them stand out extremely well. The chemistry between one another is great, as each character is good at working off one another. Personal best girls are Sanae, Saori, and Serenia. Saikyou is a bit annoying and irritating for me personally, but that\'s because that\'s how her character is made to be.The animation quality was a pleasant surprise. I expected this anime to have the same quality as most common anime, but this was a rare sight. The environments and characters are all amazingly well done, and the animation is surprisingly smooth. There were even parts where I thought, ""There was no need to animate this much detail"", but I welcome it. I\'d say the part with the most animation attention is the titties.Overall, a pleasant surprise, and a pleasant experience. I didn\'t expect this anime to be as entertaining as it is, but I\'m happy it was. It was more lewd and comedic than I was anticipating, so I\'m glad it turned out that way. Would like to see a second season for this anime. I definitely recommend you give this a watch if you are interested. to build in the world.

This didn’t live up to many expectations I had. I became very bored of the series around episode 9 and didn’t really get back into it.Story – 3It’s very plain. It has some interesting concepts about a school that teaches both royals and servants, but aside from that it ticks the boxes of an average harem series. Some of the scenes in this series are completely absurd, but can happen in the universe the story sets. All that it’s got for it is some nip...slips scenes and too many panty shots.*Spoiler Alert (If you haven’t seen the series don’t read this part) – It’s uncanny how the series points out how crap its ending is.*Art – 560% of this budget went into animating the jiggle physics that seem to exist wherever it can. The rest is normal, nothing ambitious about this series with its art, except maybe the jiggle physics.Sound – 7I like the OP and ED, the background sounds and music are ok and adds some depth, but are completely cut off with the over the top fan service.Characters – 4I don’t like these characters, their plain, just plain. You have the oblivious main man, the tsundere and the crazy characters all mixed. I the series somehow got their hands on a “how to harem” book, this would be ticking all of the “to do” boxes. The characters are forgettable as well, as of writing I watched the last episodes minutes again, and I’ve already forgot the characters names.Hino is a completely average character, with nothing redeemable about him aside from his complete and utter idiocracy and minimal social awareness. He is a plain harem man and has nothing good aside from some good interactions with the characters.Flameheart is annoying. With her appropriately given nickname, Drill, you can see how much of a tsundere she is just by hearing her full name.Tomomi is a sort of twist on childhood friend characters, she tries to control every situation, but she just makes the situation worse and/or more akward.Daichi is probably the best character in the franchise, with a motive to be at the school you can kind of connect to them.Overall – 4It’s so unbelievably average; I found it hard to watch at parts. The fan service is too much for a fun time.

Yep ! you read it right fam - ABOMINATION . Not a word you\'d associate with a genre designed to solely satisfy your not so dormant carnal desires , without having to resort to hentai or you know actually getting some.. but lets be honest - you arent getting any thats why you watch harem anime (UNLESS you are getting it , then well done bro!.. or girl.. Gender Equality for the win right?)Anyway the anime..~Synopsis~Our MC Akiharu joins a school that trains you to put...a straight smiling face whilst being oppressed by your now peers and soon to be ""masters"" .Basically they train butlers and maids....and also arrogant teenage girls from rich families how to oppress their classmates who are in the  "" servant class"" . Also the majority of students are female obviously.~Story~It would have been interesting if they just showed servant class students being trained in the brutal anime-esque fashion. The only training the mistresses get is knowing what tea and cake to order .. how original!The story telling is so bad that they spend half the season of 12 episodes introducing pointless characters , who are all basically the overused troupes we are all tired of -1) the loli ,2) the overtly cluless girl,3) the clumsy AF times ten girl with unsurprisingly large bossoms who offer a sneak peek at her panties every time she ""falls""4) the mute exotic princess who stereotypically is indian-ish  and her ninja bodyguard who\'ll go to any lengths to satisfy her5) an otaku chick6) the pervert friend who gets nothing7) the boy who keeps questioning his gender.and so onThe story never picks up any sort of movement till the last 3 episodes.

The Tsundere vs Yandere battle was by far the most entertaining thing on a show where they just cut-away to a bath with lots of nude girls when the story gets boring...or when these 2 need to ponder about their feelings for the idiot Akiharu.But what grinds the gears of most people including myself who watched the whole ordeal is the ending.. I\'m not gonna spoil it for anyone who actually wants to go waste 6 hrs on this anime. But its so bad that i think the internet got the word \'Cop-out"" from this anime. Its so bad that even one of the characters in the anime admitted it . Not joking , its true .But to be honest i think the creators did this thinking that they would be able to get a second season out of this. How deluded were they ?~Artstyle~I have to give this an 8 . Nothing new . But a pretty solid design for most characters , mainly Selnia (the tsundere) . The artsyle is perhaps the only reason i managed to finish this horrendous piece of crap.~Sound~Average.~FINAL VERDICT~If you still want me to spell out for ya - go elswhere! There are plenty of better echhi harems with uncensored content who atleast make an effort to make a decent attempt. a straight smiling face whilst being oppressed by your now peers and soon to be ""masters"" .Basically they train butlers and maids....and also arrogant teenage girls from rich families how to oppress their classmates who are in the  "" servant class"" . Also the majority of students are female obviously.~Story~It would have been interesting if they just showed servant class students being trained in the brutal anime-esque fashion. The only training the mistresses get is knowing what tea and cake to order .. how original!The story telling is so bad that they spend half the season of 12 episodes introducing pointless characters , who are all basically the overused troupes we are all tired of -1) the loli ,2) the overtly cluless girl,3) the clumsy AF times ten girl with unsurprisingly large bossoms who offer a sneak peek at her panties every time she ""falls""4) the mute exotic princess who stereotypically is indian-ish  and her ninja bodyguard who\'ll go to any lengths to satisfy her5) an otaku chick6) the pervert friend who gets nothing7) the boy who keeps questioning his gender.and so onThe story never picks up any sort of movement till the last 3 episodes.

It's really your standard harem anime, and that should be enough for you to figure out whether this is something you're interested in or not. Otherwise, there's nothing new or ground-breaking about this show that demands your attention.The only thing worth noting that maybe makes it stand out from other shows like it are things like the unique setting and honestly some moments of very beautiful animation.

Something to commend the first episode though is how it\'s the first pilot I\'ve ever seen where ecchi moments just kept escalating to such a level that I was truly baffled at the lengths the animators were willing to go...well, the same could be said about the entire series I suppose...I mean honestly, just HOW is it that everything else is UNCENSORED and filled with perplexing innuendos, but displaying a heartwarming kissing scene...is where they drew the line?!Although, I must say that I actually liked the protagonist. Sure, he is very dense per the archetype, but he\'s probably the most pragmatic character here (he delivers a killer burn during his introduction that was just, wow) and I ended up liking him throughout because of his dialogues/actions. I honestly felt bad for the guy. Like, every episode I was hoping he wouldn\'t find himself in ecchi situations, as he does not enjoy them, as well as how he has to deal with two love interests who are objectively terrible people (at least...until they aren\'t? You can\'t blame the guy from being dense with these two in all honesty). Hell, he was ALMOST RAPED in the fourth episode!! I guess the creators wanted for that to be a ""hot"" or ""sexy"" moment (very much because of the nakedness of the girl) but I was actually VERY uncomfortable, and I was glad that plot happened so that the incident was avoided.Surprisingly, the series has (very) small windows of heartwarming scenes, most of the part due to the mc\'s involvement and the characters in the story. Definitely, there are SEVERAL scenes that are just wrong, but other times I legitimately laughed. And hey, I watched the whole thing, so I guess that kinda (definitely) makes me a degenerate, so if you enjoy...""those things"", there are a bunch of scenes; The ending is what you would expect from this type of show, but a large part of me wanted to keep watching episode after episode just to find out HOW FAR they were willing to GO, which culminated in the Sports Festival and...just, oh my god.The series knows what it is, plays with it, has fun(?) with it, and overall I wouldn\'t recommend this to anyone but is the type of show you should watch if you feel like turning off your brain for 12 episodes to enjoy the equivalent of a Mcdonald\'s menu...with a whole lot of nudity.Also, Tōichirō Kazamatsuri is the BEST CHARACTER of the show. is where they drew the line?!Although, I must say that I actually liked the protagonist.

The first episode should tell you enough of what level to expect when it comes down to that.The story was really nonexistent as is expected from a show in this genre, but it really takes it further into not even bothering to place an end goal or beginning with a strong premise. It is truly a guy just shows up at this school, and you watch the ecchi hijinks that happen surrounding him.

It also boast a ton of background and side characters in the ecchi and funny moments too being it is a school theme.

Master Mosquiton '99,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1806/Master_Mosquiton_99,"['I was VERY excited to see this anime because of my experience with the OVA.The OVA, ""Master Mosquiton,"" is one of my favorites. It combines great animation, wonderful music, interesting characters, adult humor, nudity, and an ability to draw you in. It was a light-hearted tale of a vampire (Mosquiton) and his mistress (Inaho).The series takes all of that, dilutes it and stretches it so thin that you end up feeling like NOTHING happened after 26 episodes! I realize that the sex and adult content was removed so it would be seen by all ages on TV, but it was a mistake to do so:...Mosquiton was originally an adult dark comedy, and it worked.[ STORY ]The story starts very interesting and intriguing but it falls flat after repetitive episodes. The backstory later within the last 5 episodes almost saves the day but ultimately fails to make up for the series earlier shortcomings.Also, this story is a ""re-imagining"" from the OVA, which is fine, but it wasn\'t as strong a choice. ( OVA: 1920s, Mosquiton \'99:1999) 6/10[ ART ]The animation goes from TERRIBLE to fair and back again within the same scene. So disappointing since ""Master Mosquiton"" had excellent visuals. 4/10[ SOUND ]The music is pretty good. The 1920\'s big band music that trickled over from the OVA is tops and I very much enjoyed the opening theme and background music. Solid. 7/10[ CHARACTER ]Inaho is 100% annoying and vile, which is hard when she\'s the main character. Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s okay that she has many less-than-stellar traits, but she should have at least ONE redeeming quality. Mosquiton is also MUCH more of a wimp and lapdog this time around. He\'s still an adorable Bishounen (^_^). Yuki and Hoono, the two demons, are one-dimensional but are given more depth when you see their back story in their final episodes. There are also two main characters that are unique to the TV series and not the OVA: Wolf Lady and Frankie. The wolf lady proves to have a great backstory, (She cannot TOUCH a member of the opposite sex without lashing out violently/becoming more ""wolf-like"") which includes a great deal of heart breaking backstory. Frankie is boring and has no reason to be in this series.Camille, Mosquiton\'s first wife, who had a HUGE role in the OVA has no pull in the TV series. In the TV series they never establish her as Mosquiton\'s ex-wife she\'s just a henchman. Totally stupid for them to pass up her interesting story.The characters would be rated much higher, but the only good moments in their arc are their backstories, which only appear very late in the series. 5/10[ ENJOYMENT ]The first 20 episodes (give or take the few that stand out) are boring a strung out. When you get to the last 5 or so, your enjoyment goes up immensely. 6/10[ OVERALL ]Final verdict? WATCH THE OVA. It is truly fun, unique and interesting. If you have seen the OVA, and you want more Mosquiton goodness, you may want to watch this anime. It will at least give you some Mosquiton to savor. If you are NEW to this franchise, I would say pass the TV series up. You won\'t have the love of the characters already like I did- that\'s the only way I got through it. 6/10Thanks for reading.

Hope this gives a good insight as to whether or not to see this show.~ Musashi', 'This is a anime from about 10 years ago, so give it a bit of leverage here.Story:The story is a re-imagining of the OVA, it places the characters in different places, in different times with slightly different personality changes.   It starts with the greedy Inaho and she finds Mosquiton and forces him to make a contract with her.    Every episode starts with her looking or searching for a piece of O-part that fits the key she has which is slightly annoying because that was every episode.EVERY EPISODE, it was fair but it seemed like you could watch a few episodes...for the light-hearted banter between the Mosquiton & Inaho.    It seems the darkness/adult-comedy/romance isn\'t there anymore, this more of a light-hearted/romance/comedy.  Which, even though it IS the same set of characters, the storyline worked a lot better in being a dark comedy rather than a light one.Some of the character\'s backstory is different, like Camille.  She\'s not with Mosquiton and Germaine or whatever is his name is isn\'t just some guy who seemed like the bad guy at the end.     I preferred it this way, honestly.  Camille in the OVA added something, but her presence here seemed better to me, I don\'t know.The ending episodes are the best, I wish they would have spread them out.  The Christmas one was especially my favourite because it reminded me so much of how Inaho acted in the OVA and their relationship.All in all, the story was fair, kind of fun and made you shake your head at Inaho, so I gave it a 6.Art:The art was alright for it\'s day, I believe that because this has been fan-subbed that the quality has been lost on VCRs.  A lot of people complain about older anime because of this, but I don\'t fault the art or animation.    I am sad that I couldn\'t give it a better rating, because the fun use of colour would have been much better and the animation much smoother and less pixelated had there been original dvd releases.  So -- 5.Sound:Great! They use some of the old OVA music in mixture with some new tunes and some music that makes you feel like ""Oh, this is getting good!""  I loved the music, I have nothing to complain about!  -9Character:I believe that in a light-hearted scenario that this is how the characters would act because there was honestly no darkness in this anime.  Mosquiton was very light hearted and I see how he became very domesticated during the series.    They were all the same basically but with two new characters: Wolf Lady and Frankie.I liked the character\'s development here, it\'s very touching in the ending episodes.  Frankie is often funny and I like his persistence.  I think they add something to the series.THE ONLY CHARACTER I DO NOT LIKE is Akito?  Inaho\'s cousin?  She is annoying, she acts just like Inaho and she reminds me of Sailor Moon?  I don\'t know, it\'s just with Inaho being a frustrating ass, Akito comes in and does the same thing.  When they are in an episode together, I just skipped one completely because it was just stupid.    Even in the end, she was practically useless.    There did not need to be a character to try to hog Inaho\'s spotlight by acting just like her, they show no family ties which makes her appearance more annoying.Enjoyment:  If you like Mosquiton, you\'ll like this kinda.  In my brain, I think of this as a super sequel in my brain where it\'s a certain way so I don\'t think of Inaho as the same exact one in 99\', because they are different in many ways.Overall:  It\'s a little better than decent, I found myself almost tearing near the end because I love Inaho/Mosquiton :]   I think you would too if you saw the OVA for the light-hearted banter between the Mosquiton & Inaho.

Mitsubachi Maya no Bouken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2571/Mitsubachi_Maya_no_Bouken,"[""First of all I wanted to state that I know this anime from when I was a child growing up in Poland. Back then none of the kids knew what an anime was unless it was something of the sort of Sailor Moon or DragonballZ. I had basically grown up thinking it was a Polish production or European at most, complete with Polish dubbing and a Polish intro so realising it's actually an anime based on Waldemar Bonsels's stories about Maya the Bee has been quite a journey.I decided to rewatch the full series afraid it'd be too boring and childish for me to...continue but I was happily proven wrong. Although a tad outdated it's a wonderful, funny series about the diverse lives of various insects and critters existing alongside them.The character designs of all the bugs are adorable and lovable, the animation - a little janky - but more expressive and you can definitely see the hand-drawn-ness of it in the way the characters move. Their endearing designs are a great lighthearted way to introduce a child to the world of insects without giving them trauma :PAlso I absolutely adore the backgrounds of the series. They seem to be done in watercolor or gouache, and they look beautiful and professionally done. As a watercolor fanatic I have saved a bunch of stills from the series as inspiration fodder.Maya the Bee also has pretty decent music composed for the series, with my favourites being the cicadas' and crickets' musical numbers and the intro. In the Polish dub the intro was sung by Zbigniew Wodecki who had done a wonderful job, the intro being so catchy in Poland almost every then-kid-now-adult knows at least the main part of the song.The characters can be a little bit basic but each of the main characters has their own distinctive way of being without coming off as bland. None of them are too perfect to be true and all have their strengths and weaknesses well balanced out. The main theme of the series is about how different they all are and how it's crucial not to judge each other harshly, as every creature's journey through life is different and deserves respect.Anyway, I had a blast coming back to the series and was delighted to see that even as an adult it succeeded in educating me about the world of insects and inspiring me with the beautiful painted landscapes. It's a charming series with great rewatch value. continue but I was happily proven wrong.

Their endearing designs are a great lighthearted way to introduce a child to the world of insects without giving them trauma :PAlso I absolutely adore the backgrounds of the series. They seem to be done in watercolor or gouache, and they look beautiful and professionally done. As a watercolor fanatic I have saved a bunch of stills from the series as inspiration fodder.Maya the Bee also has pretty decent music composed for the series, with my favourites being the cicadas' and crickets' musical numbers and the intro. In the Polish dub the intro was sung by Zbigniew Wodecki who had done a wonderful job, the intro being so catchy in Poland almost every then-kid-now-adult knows at least the main part of the song.The characters can be a little bit basic but each of the main characters has their own distinctive way of being without coming off as bland. None of them are too perfect to be true and all have their strengths and weaknesses well balanced out. The main theme of the series is about how different they all are and how it's crucial not to judge each other harshly, as every creature's journey through life is different and deserves respect.Anyway, I had a blast coming back to the series and was delighted to see that even as an adult it succeeded in educating me about the world of insects and inspiring me with the beautiful painted landscapes. It's a charming series with great rewatch value."", 'The true OG anime. It\'s the beezneez of cinema. The intro song slaps ASS and it made me cry, especially the part where she looks at the moon all melancholic like. Ya know ""5月、誰もがこの5月が好き"".The art style of the classic renaissance era of the 1970s ages like fine wine in an oak barrel (or whatever the best barrel wood is). Not like the shit modern 3D art that they use in the movies and show (I spit on them).My favourite character is the Spider.So if you\'re in a mood for a thrilling adventure and a unforgettable experience give this a watch.

Mizugumo Monmon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4306/Mizugumo_Monmon,"[""Monmon is one of six anime films shown only in the Ghibli Museum's Saturn Theatre. It's just a short film animated by Studio Ghibli. I'm probably one the few people on MAL who's seen this. According to wikipedia each month the museum will show a different one of these six films. So to see them all you'd have to be in Japan for six months and go to the museum once a month. The only other other option is to watch a crappy recording from inside the theatre. There are some on youtube, but I don't know if they show the entire animation.As I said...the film is short. Only about 15 minuets. The animation is your typical Ghibli animation, so it's pretty good. The artwork is pretty simple. The sounds are all good. I can't remember how good the music was, but I think it was pretty good. Any Ghibli fan would probably like this movie. It's just too bad these movies are so hard to see. I'd write more of a review, but the film is very short so there is not much to write about. That, and my memory of it could be a lot better. the film is short. Only about 15 minuets. The animation is your typical Ghibli animation, so it's pretty good. The artwork is pretty simple.

The music was lovely and, since it's Ghibli, the animation was gorgeous as well. Such a sweet story but also bittersweet. I would go back to the museum solely for the purpose of seeing this again (I loved it so much)! If you're lucky enough to have the opportunity to visit the museum I hope you're able to see it. "", ""I really enjoyed this short film and it's such a pity that not a lot of people are able to see it. The music was amazing and as always even though the storyline was not sad, my eyes teared up. Highly recommend to watch this one while in Japan :) ""]"
Morita-san wa Mukuchi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9774/Morita-san_wa_Mukuchi,"[""This OVA was made earlier than the TV series, but I made the mistake of watching it later. Unlike the TV episodes it is a full-length 24 minute episode. And it's damn good.It starts with a segment made up of yon-koma panels which speak. Well, basically you have the characters faces as they appear in the manga and there's dubbed audio. There's Miki, Chihiro and Hana doing some introductions of the characters and talking about random stuff for 2 minutes. After this starts the actual episode. And well, the only way I can describe it is that watching this will basically feel like reading 100...chapters of a 4-koma manga at once, if you know what I mean. It's just about mini-occurences and how the characters react to them, how they interact with each other etc. As you get to know them, understand their quirks, you grow to love them, bit by bit, as the chapters fly past.Well, the main appeal of this anime to me was the titular character, Morita-san herself. She's cute, she's lovable, and though she doesn't speak a lot, she thinks too much. Way too much, in fact. Her overthinking things and being unable to do anything as a result is a running gag in the series. The episode is all over the place though, really. There are funny moments, there's wholesome moments, there's some scenes with yuri bait and all in all it's one good OVA episode that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Neo Ranga,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1163/Neo_Ranga,"[""Neo Ranga is one of those ‘great shows that no one’s heard of’, only this time it’s underrated as well as overlooked. According to MAL, only one of my friends has seen the show (and he's seen everything) and only a small number of total members as well. What’s more, the collective score is only 6.63, and the results are similar on ANN. Why? How could a show so great get so overlooked? Actually, I’m pretty sure I know.Neo Ranga is, without a doubt, one of the outright strangest anime I’ve seen. Which is funny, because at the same time, it’s not very far off...from other anime of it’s length – the plot progression, general themes, and especially the ending are all pretty familiar to anime fans, but the presentation is totally unique. Neo Ranga is composed of 48 half-length episodes (effectively a 24-ep series) which are paced like a raging fucking tornado. The best way to describe the sheer speed and deftness of events in Neo Ranga is ‘brutal’, and this is the series’ greatest strength, right up until the end. What’s more, the series is utterly unexpected in the way it handles it’s themes and wordview, which is to say, it takes them really seriously. …Or does it?Neo Ranga’s pace takes some real getting used to. The series begins with Neo Ranga itself, an enormous kaiju, stomping through Tokyo, with exactly the kind of reactions and presentation you’d expect from a Godzilla movie. As it turns out, Neo Ranga is a god, and three parentless Japanese girls are the ‘owners’ of this god, thanks to the fact that their older brother, who left home 10 years ago, became the king of a souteat Asian autonomous kingdom called Barou which had worshiped the god to this point. And then we get a whole smorgasbord of themes presented in the most flawless method imaginable.Neo Ranga covers everything. Military politics, religious politics, psychology, ambitions, morals, the minds and actions of each of it’s characters, social issues, world issues – everything. It starts off with a huge maelstrom of emotions and actions as the whole world has to deal with the sudden appearance of a god and, more importantly, three young women have to deal with being it’s masters. However, it’s not like this show is stiff and serious – on the contrary. The show’s drama is met with an equal force of comedy, tongue-in-cheek, and lightheartedness, but because of the ingenious presentation, it never lessens the blow of the drama. Actually, it enhances it, because it humanizes it. The drama of politics can sometimes seem like a silly and overblown game, but it’s effects are still very real, and something that can seem comically-timed one moment can turn out to have gruesome consequences the next. And this show never, ever ignores the consequences of it’s actions.This is, however, what makes the show hard to get into at first, because it demands you be attentive and not take anything at face value. This is the point where I feel I should tell you that it’s taken me around 2 and a half years to finish Neo Ranga. The first time I tried watching it, I got through 7 episodes before the stream I was watching fucked up, and I was unable to continue. The second time, I downloaded the series, and I watched 18 episodes of it before I stopped, and while I had never stopped liking the series a lot, I didn’t feel a huge urge to continue. My reason was that I was finding the series terribly confusing. I mistook the constant changing between what felt like serious scenes and comedic scenes to be the series’ simple quirkiness and didn’t look for anything deep in it, so I just took it as one of those series that is memorable for the same reasons it is flawed, sort of like Futakoi Alternative (no to knock that great show, but it’s pacing is an issue just as it is an asset.) However, now that I’ve finally watched all of Neo Ranga on the box set I bought some time ago, I can safely say that I was wrong about my initial impression.Neo Ranga requires attention. It is so fast, so merciless, and demands such an extent of ability from the viewer to understand what is going on, that it requires real concentration. Unfortunately, though, this incredible strength is also what magnifies the series’ biggest weakness. As I made my way through Neo Ranga, I began to wonder why it was that this show never got to be remembered as a ‘classic.’ I knew it wouldn’t have had a chance to be an Eva-level classic, even though I think it was easily presented as well as Evangelion, but I would have thought it could at least have reached Martian Successor Nadesico-level cult status. And then I got to the ending. Neo Ranga has one of the most disappointing endings I’ve ever seen in anime. In truth, there was a point during the last 8 episodes wherein I thought ‘if it ends right here, it can still be totally satisfying’, but Neo Ranga does a stupefying move in using the last four episodes to rush through a truckload of new twists and plot points that drained all of my interest and eventually had me begging for it to hurry up and end before it got any worse. The last episode doesn’t even have time to provide a resolution to the series, leaving a horrible taste in my mouth.However, this should not have been enough to defeat the series. Even Martian Successor Nadesico had a pretty disappointing ending (albeit still better than Neo Ranga’s) and there are series like the infamous Escaflowne who fucked their pacing throughout the entire second half of the series and swan-dove into an unbelievably terrible ending, but still got remembered as a classic. There is definitely a lot more to like about Neo Ranga than there was about Escaflowne, and that’s saying a lot.It’s possible that the series never got big in America simply because it aired between 1998 and 1998, and from what I’ve heard, there is a sort of vacuum from 98 to 02 that for some reason, many of the shows that came out in that period in Japan went totally unknown here. someone help me if that’s true of this show.As per my usual methods of dissecting what I love about a show, I’ll start with the presentation itself. Neo Ranga is the kind of show that could only be some creator’s darling lovechild, and the viewer will certainly notice original creator and writer Sho Aikawa’s (no, not that Sho Aikawa) name all over the place. Indeed, Neo Ranga is spectacularly directed, animated, and storyboarded, but I think the writing is the true force of greatness in this show. The script and the way that events are sequenced have an airtight, brilliant cinematic quality, as if the show was more intent on being a live-action movie or series all along (a fact that seems even more pertinent when you consider the segments in next episode previews wherein characters sometimes talked about how they ‘filmed’ certain scenes.) A lot of the early episodes heavily involve yakuza, which is why I guess it’s no surprise that they are directed like Battles Without Honor or Humanity. This is definitely a show that I think cinemaphiles can get into.Actually, one movie that I think makes a great comparison to at least the early episodes of Neo Ranga is my favorite movie, The Dark Knight. They are similar in that they are directed like gangster films and deal with all sorts of socio-political issues, from an angle wherein completely overblown entities exist and ideals are blasted around with full force and wide-open hearts.I think what I really wanted from Neo Ranga was for it to last much, much longer. I loved the way that it studied socio-politics from right in the thick of it, and how it ran these issues through the minds of it’s characters, developing them with each new occurrence. The reason that the ending was so disappointing wasn’t just because it came so suddenly and ham-handedly, but because there was so much left for this series to cover. The characters had made progress, but there was still so much more they needed to learn, and do, and become. There were a ton of potential relationships in this show that were left totally open-ended. Every character had something that they were missing, that they were trying to find, and in the end, we not only didn’t get to see anyone to the end of their path, but we didn’t even get a solid view of where they’d be going.Did Aikawa know this? Did he intend for his series to be much longer, but couldn’t afford it? Neo Ranga was apparently split into two separate seasons, divided at the 24 episode mark. I want to say that while the entire series was great, the first half had just a bit of an edge over it the second. There were fewer of those moments of sheer brilliance in the second half, even if it continued to be great until it’s sudden, rushed, and botched ending. Was Aikawa disappointed? Did he half-heartedly try to get as many of his points across as he could before having to end his series? Did he purposefully cram the ending into the last few episodes because he wanted more time to flesh out the things that mattered in the series? I can’t ask him, and with the amount of recognition that Neo Ranga has after 12 years since it finished airing, I doubt anyone cares enough to fight for an answer. That’s what makes Neo Ranga the epitome of a ‘cult classic’. It never got the chance to be a fully-realized epic, so all we have left is to take the great things that it gave and try to use our own imagination to see what it could have been. from other anime of it’s length – the plot progression, general themes, and especially the ending are all pretty familiar to anime fans, but the presentation is totally unique.

However, far from a simple girl-meets-sentient-mecha anime, Neo Ranga takes a wide-angle view of the story...and is as much about Tokyo and its citizens as it is about the sisters.  We are introduced to local merchants, crooked politicians, ambitious tv producers, opportunistic yakuza, a military excited to try out new weapons on Ranga, disanchanted youth, secret societies, etc, all of whom must come to grips with this seemingly omnicient power.  Perhaps it's worth noting that this was a late '90s production with the fear of Y2K still looming large on the horizon.Neo Ranga is very episodic in nature &amp; often feels disjointed in its presentation due to its short episode length.  This is very much a slice-of-life series  (with very little that could be construed as horror, at least in the traditional sense), as the 3 sisters struggle through their daily existance even as a giant god sits in their backyard &amp; half of Tokyo bears down on them for one reason or another.  The sisters themselves are fairly archetypal (I'm sure a Freudian analysis would be valid here) as Ushio is generally idealistic, Yuuhi destructive, and Minami, the older, more pragmatic caregiver.  That said, I didn't think the personalities were too overbearing or static - they came across as genuine characters, true to their ages rather than as allegorical puppets.The other characters in the series were reasonably well-developed,  - they felt genuine in their purpose and didn't seem to exist simply to push the plot in a contrivial manner.  A couple of the more antagonistic characters in the 2nd half of the series failed to live up to this description, but otherwise, I had no qualms.Through the 1st 40 episodes (41-48 comes later), the animation, art, and character design was remarkable.  The style feels very much a product of its time. It lacks the smooth crisp lines of most Gonzo or Bones productions of today, instead relying on a gritty, realistic feel with occasional artistic flourishes - this anime has my favorite Tokyo-look ever.  The girls themselves have typically massive eyes and sharp foxlike features - the rest of the characters vary from foxlike to potatolike depending on whether they are meant to be attractive.  The god/mecha design also was excellent, though often very strange (which is what I like I guess) and at times, rather silly.Sound production was great - the voice actors were well-cast and there wasn't anything in the anime itself that proved detrimental.  The songs are certainly a bizarre set - the opening tracks rely on groovy &quot;tribal&quot; rhythms and chanting.  Season 1's op theme is one of my favorite anime songs ever, a bit of a throwback to '60s and '70s b-movie exploitation themes. The 2nd season's op theme has more of a Ennio Morricone feel to it but doesn't work as well, mainly due to (purposely?) poor use of synthetic voice sampling.  The endsongs left less impression, though I remember trying to avoid listening to the 2nd season endsong as much as possible (reminded me of Escaflowne's endsong).The next paragraph mentions the last few episodes of the anime - not the story so much as the form and quality. I don't really consider that a spoiler but if you do - might wanna skip it.Regarding episodes 41-48:  I've seen a few ambitious anime series that simply don't quite know what to do with themselves down the stretch, usually a quality-drop is in order.  However, I have never seen such a transformation in tone, pacing, and animation style as occurs with Neo Ranga in it's final episodes.  Episodes 41-42 and part of 43 look as though they were produced by a completely different company altogether (production i.g. is my guess).  Most of the humor is jettisoned and the story rockets forward into the bizarre and outlandish...perhaps incoherent.  But what's really odd, is that it's not badly done.  I enjoyed the end as much as the rest, I just felt I was watching a different show.Overall, Neo Ranga is one of the most idiosyncratically enjoyable anime series I've seen, and at the end I felt it was as fully realized a world as I've come across in an anime series, with likeable characters who's actions &amp; reactions, while in the shadow of the massive Ranga, made sense (until episode 41).  Though perhaps hard to recommend - maybe too slow and goofy for most mecha fans and too dark and strange for fans of domestic comedy, but, if you're looking for something a bit different, curious, thoughtful, and self-aware, you might want to give Neo Ranga a shot. and is as much about Tokyo and its citizens as it is about the sisters.

I enjoyed the end as much as the rest, I just felt I was watching a different show.Overall, Neo Ranga is one of the most idiosyncratically enjoyable anime series I've seen, and at the end I felt it was as fully realized a world as I've come across in an anime series, with likeable characters who's actions &amp; reactions, while in the shadow of the massive Ranga, made sense (until episode 41).  Though perhaps hard to recommend - maybe too slow and goofy for most mecha fans and too dark and strange for fans of domestic comedy, but, if you're looking for something a bit different, curious, thoughtful, and self-aware, you might want to give Neo Ranga a shot."", ""I watched 22 episodes of this series. I gave it far more chances than it deserves.To say the least, this is the worst anime series I have ever seen. The story was just undesirable from the beginning. I couldn't connect with the characters or even care about them... ANY. As for animation, it was decently made. Nothing to gawk at. The box and cover art is misleading because it portrays girls in colorful and interesting looking body paint and near nudity... but in the show there are only a few sparse scenes involving such. Its like making a movie about the moon with box art...featuring an artful shot of a tree. Most of the episodes are irrelevant to anything... and no major underlying plot was perceivable.The story seems to lull and just spin around nothing. Its all about a big rock creature that shows up in the first episode. For the entire 22 episodes I've seen, the plot advanced at a snail's pace. Basically nothing changed. I finally couldn't take it anymore so I dropped it. If I could go back in time I would punch myself in the face and kick myself in the balls for even considering watching it.I had to write this because no one else had placed a negative review here. The numbers may speak for themselves. Check how many times this has been favorited. Only twice at the time that I wrote this review.In conclusion, you are completely free to watch this series. But if you're anything like me... go watch something with a more progressive plot, like paint drying on a wall. featuring an artful shot of a tree.

Pretty much, Neo Ranga is focused on how the presence of Ranga makes the lives of the Shimabara sisters turn upside-down when they inherit a kingdom from their dead brother. The first half of the series is mostly a mix of social satire and slice-of-life comedy focused on how Ranga\'s presence effects the neighborhood in which the Shimabaras live in and how this invites figures like crooked politicians, the mass media, yakuza and the military to get entangled in the hijinks. From how...I interpreted things, Neo Ranga was apparently poking fun of the cultural divide between those embracing Western influences and those trying to uphold the older traditions of Japan\'s past. While the humor was a bit hit or miss for me, the show\'s first half was structured well enough where it knew what it wished to focus on and things appeared to be getting interesting when the secret society called the Kyoshin Council made their move to gain influence in Japan.Sadly, the second half to Neo Ranga takes a big hit in quality as the show got too experimental for its own good in what it wanted to focus on. The focus seemed to have shifted on the tensions between the Shimabaras and the Kyoshin Council at first, but the series decided to return to its slice-of-life/ social satire mix for a bit with the addition of ""monster of the day"" plot setups compliments of the Kyoshin Council as this mixture was a bit of a miss. Some of the themes focused on with Christmas and filming for TV specials were quite outlandish compared to the first half\'s focus on poking fun of more influential elements of Japanese society. The series then decides to go back to being more serious for the show\'s final episodes with the actions of the Kyoshin Council, a third faction that gets poorly introduced and hardly any depth and attempting to philosophize the worth of freedom and worship of gods. However with the sloppy handling of these developments and not being consistent with the tone of Neo Ranga\'s first half, these elements for the show\'s finale lack the punch they could have delivered if consistently delivered throughout the title\'s complete run.Another area that Neo Ranga tends to be weak in is character depth. The series tacked on many of its prominent character with simple personalities such as Yuuhi being rebellious and pampered, Ushio being the heroic tomboy and Minami their stressed-out surrogate mother/ sister. While the simplicity was fine for much of the show\'s first half, Neo Ranga\'s attempts to incorporate more serious plot development and complex themes required more depth for these characters introduced. With exception to a few notable characters whose roles are expanded upon from the first half, the Shimabara sisters and most other characters don\'t get much depth given to their characters and their characters don\'t evolve too much throughout the show\'s run.Visual-wise, Neo Ranga does make use of cel-shaded animation in the designs of scenery and character designs which looked solid to a great extent throughout the show\'s run as many shots featured a great amount of detail put into the designs of scenery and monster designs. The animation isn\'t the title\'s best highlight, but it gets the job done in depicting character movement and battle scenes.Overall, I\'m not really sure what drew my mind to come back to this show when I put it on hold years ago. Neo Ranga was seemingly experimenting with differing ways in which to explore its themes as its first half had a solid focus with its mix of slice-of-life and social satire while the second half became quite a mess in its overall focus. While it explores some interesting themes related to Japanese society at large, the series didn\'t seem to be sure how it wanted to implement them effectively while maintaining a consistent focus and tone.

Tao itself being an egotistical, tyrannical entity evolved elsewhere and wishing to control everything oposing it.All in all, great show, very good anmation, very well developed plot and a really entertaining show to watch.I highly recomend it!I reasn I give it an overall 9 because the animation team was not the same through the whole series, and some characters could have been better developed. Minor over the whole of the series but yet could have been a full 10 easily. has many interesting points and turns, and the action is fair without transforming it into one of those boooooring fighting animes so in fashion (sadly).The plot is carried well and without filler episodes, being a constant evolution to the final episodes.Some elements, as Minami and Haseoka, were not completely explored in the end, but then again perfection is had to achieve.The end was well done and does close the story, and yet leaves it open for a real sequel, as it did laid a very interesting ideas and plot points that could produce a really interesting sequel.Some o the plot ideas echoes animes like Demon Lord Dante, which has a really interesting plot regarding ancient powers fighting in Earth's past and mixing/victimizing humans in the process.I really liked Neo Ranga's concept, which can even be moved into full science fiction category if seen into the perspectivew that the Kyoshinkai were classified as machines by the Tao's emissaries.

What would you do if....??Neo Ranga tells the story of three average girls put into an extra ordinary position.  After their brothers passing, the girl\'s ""inherit"" a God named Ranga.  This gift-of-such however is not always a blessing, for the people of Japan are not sure how to accept this newcomer.The three sisters have their own ideas of how to use Ranga.  The oldest sister, concerned about her family\'s well being tries to profit from their new found fame.  The middle sister tries to help the people of Japan with Ranga\'s power....The youngest sister, infuriated about the welcoming home, tries to use Ranga to destroy the population of Japan and her enemies.Because of the sisters indecision, Ranga is torn and develops a personality all of his own.  The people fear Ranga, and with due cause.  A 50\' Bio-Beast now lives in the city, destroying it piece by piece every time he moves.  Yes, he has helped the people, but at what cost...??As the story progresses, and the characters develop, we learn that the sisters all have similar goals in mind and that Ranga is no more of a God than we ourselves are.Story 10Neo Ranga is by far one of the nicest stories I have watched in quite some time.  Right from the first 10 minute episode (which at first I was not overly fond of, but by the end of the series I really got into) I knew that this was going to be sometime special.  You know the feeling when eveything just clicks within the first few moments and you know right then are there that nothing about the series could disappoint you...that\'s the feeling you get...POW right off the bat.Though not comepletely original (pleanty of series have giant ""monsters"" or ""Gods"" as a main focus for a story), something about this series stands apart.  Perhaps it\'s the interaction between the main and supporting characters.  Perhaps it\'s the way the series plays off both sides to each senerio (meaning who is right and who is wrong??).  Perhaps it\'s the way Neo Ranga himself is portrayed as a God, but has so much humanity and flaws within himself that you feel for him.  I can\'t put my finger on it but the story rocked.Art 8Nothing about the way this series was drawn was overwhelming.  That\'s what made it so friggin\' fantastic.  Yes it was produced in \'99 and yes since then anime has come a long way, but the grittiness and flawed production quality is one of the reasons that this title stands leagues above others.Sound 9The soundtrack suited the series just fine.  I\'ll be the first to admit that rarely do I sit through the opening and closing credits, and this series was no different.  Also, I don\'t really pay that much attention to the background music.  I\'m sure everything was just fine beacuse I didn\'t sit up and say, ""Well that sounded stupid"".I did however like the English voice cast.  I think they cast the actors very well and that 90% or more of the cast suited the characters perfectly.  That being said, I didn\'t watch any of the series in it\'s orignal Japanese language so they may or may not sound good.  Couldn\'t tell you.Character 10One of the best things about this series was how completely believable each and everyone of the characters are.  You can put yourself in each one of their shoes and be like, ""Yup, that\'s what I would do.""  And I am not just refering to the main actresses.  All the supporting roles were right-on-the-money too.It was also nice to see female lead characters that were just normal.  They weren\'t stupid.  They didn\'t have shill voices.  They didn\'t have tits that were falling out of their barely-there clothes.  They were just your run-of-the-mill, girl-next-door kinda girls.  The have problems with work, with school and with boys.  The don\'t always know what is right, and make mistakes just like the rest of us.  It was a real treat to sit down to an anime that I could relate to.Enjoyment 9I loved it.  Beautifully crafted.  Great story, which came to a great conclusion.  Couple twists and turns thrown it to keep it interesting (sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn\'t).  It was a pretty orignal idea for the most part even though some concepts were loosely borrowed.  It was just a fun, emotion filled series.Overall 9After watching fanservice after samurai after mecha series, Neo Ranga was a great change of pace.  With 10 minute episodes you can really sit back and power through the series quickly or take your time and enjoy each and every episode.

Second season (24 episodes), well, it\'s hit and miss with more misses than hits.  The attempts at humor go up a few notches during the 2nd half, and that is to the show\'s detriment.  Which is why it managed to become a relief when the over-the-top final act of the show begins, even if it is rushed and confusing as hell.  Then the last 2 episodes caused me to change my opinion; there is such a thing as too over-the-top, especially in anime (as many of these shows are prone to do; they\'re almost never...subtle).The show is at it\'s best when it tackles how government and organization react to the appearance of the Ranga kaiju.  How it evolves from national to international incidents, the political maneuvers, the responsibility of those in power (including the 3 girls who can control Ranga).  Those moments that critique society and governments are great stuff, but it becomes too heavy-handed once those red fist people show up during the 2nd season.The 2nd season still has some of that critique, but it\'s overshadowed by this lame ""monster of the week"" formula that just doesn\'t work.  It could\'ve worked, if it had more emphasis on world governments trying to get their own kaiju and control it and thus fight Ranga with it to have a stronger presence in the world; but the execution was lame.

Sure, plenty of these are great, but they also require the context of the story to fully appreciate.

One Piece really changed throughout the years and this feels more like a...documentary than a recap.There was also a weirdly placed promo for the Karakuri Castle movie (movie 7) before the Alabasta Robin part, but okay, probably a reminder that I should rewatch the One Piece movies for God knows what time now. documentary than a recap.There was also a weirdly placed promo for the Karakuri Castle movie (movie 7) before the Alabasta Robin part, but okay, probably a reminder that I should rewatch the One Piece movies for God knows what time now.']"

If you like Akira, A.D Police Files, Battle Angel, Ghost in the Shell or those type anime, you won't be disappointed. Animation is good and it starts slow, but picks up good. Decent violence and gore. Fits in well with anime from the 90's and has high rewatchability due to only having 3 episodes.

It takes place in Bubblegum Crisis universe, but you don't really need to watch that anime to pick this one up.It is some old school, hand drawn, gritty cyber-punk.  It is very adult themed, with ideas about human sexuality in the age of androids being interwoven into the story.The soundtrack is really, really good.  It is some underground type EDM stuff that goes really well with the dark drawing and atmosphere of the whole show.Old school cyber punk style anime is kind of my thing, and this is one of the best...out there. out there."", ""The story in Parasite Dolls is tepidly interesting, but it's also very derivative. It borrows many aspects from other cyberpunk films, such as Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell. This would be fine, but it also doesn't do any of the things it borrows quite as well as the originals did. What we're left with is a disjointed story that seems more like an excuse for some forced drama and action instead of a coherent and interesting tale.The characters do manage to be somewhat interesting, and are introduced rather well in the first episode, giving the viewer a good sense of their personality, and...their relation to each other. However, the show also fails to build upon them, and in the second and third episodes they fall into the background while the show continues to bring it's convoluted plot to the forefront.The story is accompanied by a cheesy sounding, but still somewhat entertaining soundtrack that doesn't amaze, but gets the job done well enough. The voice acting (in the English Dub) similarly, doesn't amaze, but is also not horrible or grating to listen to. Overall, the audio is pretty standard, and doesn't seem very good or very bad.The most positive thing I can say about this OVA is that it was fairly impressive in terms of the animation. Everything moved very fluidly, and the characters all had unique, yet not outlandish, designs. However, the art styles also seem a bit mixed. In the first two episodes, the art seemed pretty consistent. However, in the third episode, there's a slight change in art style, and it gets overloaded with subtle CG effects. Because of that, it doesn't look quite as good as the first two episodes, and it complicates what would have otherwise been purely a traditionally animated OVA.Overall, Parasite Dolls is a cyberpunk anime that tries too hard to emulate aspects of other popular cyberpunk films. It tries to carve out it's own niche, and attempts to create some interesting characters, but with each new episode it slowly loses it's appeal, and ultimately never capitalizes on it's initial potential. By the end, all that's left is a husk of a show. One that I enjoyed, but still wonder about how much better it could have been.I give Parasite Dolls a 6/10. their relation to each other.

It tries to carve out it's own niche, and attempts to create some interesting characters, but with each new episode it slowly loses it's appeal, and ultimately never capitalizes on it's initial potential. By the end, all that's left is a husk of a show. One that I enjoyed, but still wonder about how much better it could have been.I give Parasite Dolls a 6/10."", 'Parasite Dolls is set in the universe of the anime series Bubblegum Crisis(BGC), which is a futuristic world that involves battles between man and machine. The OVA also happens to join the ranks of the previous spin offs of the series: A.D. Police: Serve and Protect, and A.D. Police: Files 1-3. I\'ll start by pointing out as mediocre as it is, this is definitely the best of the BGC spin offs, because to me both incarnations of the A.D. Police were very close to utter trash and this is coming from a fan of the franchise. Parasite Dolls has quite a bit going for it,...but it does have a few issues keeping it from being a must see title.Parasite Dolls has its moments in the visuals department. The very beginning suffers from lackluster animation, character designs, and backgrounds. It definitely starts out with the look of a low budget OVA. Eventually, the series picks up with the visuals in the later episodes. The artwork becomes a little more pleasing to look at with pretty backgrounds and the well use of lighting and camera angles. The action scenes are limited because the anime attempts to push the story through its characters. However, the action scenes really aren\'t impressive in the least bit. They completely lack imagination which happens to be the trend with all of these spin offs. The animation doesn\'t suffer from stills, or an over abundance of reused cells; but there was one moment where it was definitely inconsistent. One of the side characters named Angel, whom had the appearance of an African American female with white hair, all of the sudden was Caucasian with white hair. This type of inconsistency is just in your face and is very hard not to notice.The soundtrack is alright at best and it delivers a cyber punk feel. The opening song called ""Get on the Beat"" is a techno track with an electronic beat. The background music which is almost of the same type has a nice sound as well. I especially enjoyed it in a scene where it was dimmed down to the point where only the bass can be heard. I really didn\'t have a problem with the English cast or the Seiyuu. They were both fine to me and seemed to fit well with the character types.The series is definitely meant for those whom are familiar with the BGC mythos, because the organizations such as A.D. Police and Genome have already been covered in detail. There is a certain story point covered here such as the purpose of Boomers. Therefore, someone whom is unfamiliar with the franchise will still know what\'s going on, but there will be questions that aren\'t fully answered or answered at all.The series is broken into three separate stories. I definitely give the series credit on the stories despite how derivative the series may be overall. It does ask the same age old question: Who is the real monster, man or machine? There happens to be dual plots taking place with one concerning the Boomers developing emotions, along with the sick perverted minds of man. The writing is pretty strong developing both through some disturbing content. However, I felt the actual ending didn\'t exactly wrap everything up on a strong note.Character development is very shaky from where I see it. The main characters Buzz and one of his subordinates a female named Reiko Michaelson are given a bit of depth; but there were situations injected that really didn\'t go anywhere, and it came off as meaningless filler. The interactions between these two could have been jettisoned altogether and focused on an additional character whose actions played a part into the ending. This would have given the series a more satisfying conclusion. In all honesty, most of the boomers were developed better.One more thing that bothered me is the exact same thing that bothered me with the other spin offs. Other than dealing with androids or cyborgs. The series doesn\'t have a real futuristic feel. The original BGC trumps this as well in regards to the futuristic atmosphere. The weapons, landscapes, vehicles, technology all seems too modern. This is some of the reason why Ghost in the Shell and even Armitage have little competition in the sci-fi and cyberpunk department; and if anime studios continue churning out stuff like this. They may never be toppled.All things considered, Parasite Dolls is slightly average at best and that\'s pushing it. The series does contain soft sex scenes, nudity, and disturbing images, however  the meaningless comedy that ruins a series image is completely non existent which is a good thing. I mainly recommend this to fans of BGC and die hard cyber punks. If you enjoyed either one of the A.D. Police spin offs. Then give this a shot.Highs: Dark setting, mature themesLows: Action is not impressive nor very imaginable, not for everyone but it does have a few issues keeping it from being a must see title.Parasite Dolls has its moments in the visuals department.

The story is disjointed and confusing, with numerous plot incongruences. Such as a character getting blasted the fuck up in an explosion, we’re talking about a normal human in this instance, and then they’re shown surviving it? How? Why? Your questions mean nothing to this anime.• There is also an elongated and unnecessarily graphic scene, where a batshit insane dude is fucking a girl from behind and then shoots her in the back of the head, and her brain matter splatters everywhere and he...keeps fucking her corpse. Those kind of things made the series less entertaining for me, though it seemed as if the creators were doing that to establish a bleak atmosphere. Shock shlock is nothing that a refined viewer should be expected to put stakes into.• The director of Patlabor was one of the two head directors on this project, so there are some similarities in how their cyberpunk worlds feel. You can also expect it to be exceedingly dark  because the script writer who penned Vampire Princess Miyu (TV) and Texhnolyze wrote this script. I think that this OVA can be very appealing to watch, based on the aesthetic and atmosphere alone… Only, keep in mind that this OVA is not something that I would ever consider good.• Parasite Dolls is in the same universe as Bubblegum Crisis, though two VERY different takes on the world. The basis of the story is very similar to many other science fiction premises: Who is truly in the wrong, man or machine? Like, Ghost in the Shell.  There are weird inconsistencies with the cells and animation frames.• One of the side characters named Angel, who had the appearance of an African American female with white hair, but in a different scene, suddenly was Caucasian with white hair. This type of inconsistency is just in your face and is very hard not to notice. It’s like that one episode of the D.N. Angel anime, where Risa Harada suddenly has red hair instead of brown.• The characters and the story aren’t memorable at all. The only thing that I can piece together from my watching of it, was that there was a cool cyberpunk worldーspecifically there is a scene that I admired where there’s a landscape shot of the protagonist on the balcony of his overly-mechanized apartment complex and the scene pans away to the buildings towering above everything, like a futuristic Tower of Babylon, ominous hopelessly resides and we’re left to marvel at the scenery, while the sound of a saxophone that slides as smooth as liquid, and the experience drips into the viewer’s senses. Parasite Dolls is haunting. Though ironic that the atmosphere and world are the pinnacle of the experience in Parasite Dolls, seeing as it’s already a pre-established universe. Parasite Dolls is something that was seen often in the late 90’s and early 2000’s.• The Matrix monotony and pessimism was ran rampant in the cyberpunk community and anime series like Armitage caught its fever. I enjoyed this trend, but they were mass-produced so heavily at the time that most/I mean like probably 90% of the things produced were garbageーmanufactured in the form of short OVAs. Like the mass amount of TV series we get now (via streaming), there used to be nothing but trash OVAs back in the day that you would watch once from a video store, just to have something to watch with friends and a box of cheap, slimy pizza.• Overall, the series could have been much better. It’s okay to watch, like once, but nothing that requires further exploration. Literary works like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (Philip K. Dick) and the Robot series (Isaac Asimov), as well as other animated creations like Ghost in the Shell, Metropolis, or Astro Boy are better representations of the theme.

All and all, I give Parasite Dolls a 3/10.', 'Parasite Dolls is different from most cyberpunk works that I\'ve seen in that it is specifically fixated on sexual fantasy, and the role of the object and subject therein. It\'s rather violent, but it\'s not an action packed series; it has a typically pensive Chiaki Konaka script. If you like the slow, thoughtful series he\'s worked on, especially where cyberpunk themes are involved, you\'ll probably enjoy this. If not, it is only 3 episodes, but be warned that it features a good deal of graphic violence, including sexual violence.Checklist:Art - Quite goodSound - Not badCharacters - They serve their purposeBuzz, the ""main character"" I guess,...has an emotionless working relationship with his ex girlfriend Angel, represses his emotions over a past tragedy, cannot envision Reiko as sexually viable, and pathologically presses the issue of his boomer partner\'s inhumanity and lack of emotion. In other words, he\'s the obligatory guy who\'s more like a cyborgs than the cyborgs are. Other than a bit of investigation, providing direction, and picking on his boomer partner, he is actually not involved in the drama (until the last 10 minutes when a bunch of stuff is revealed which I won\'t spoil, but it doesn\'t affect this analysis much). Rod is the boomer partner. He doesn\'t understand social mores very well. Maybe he\'s a bit more human than he seems, who knows, he\'s not really a major part of the story. Reiko, who\'s another officer in Branch, a special... branch of the A.D. police that investigates these boomer related cases, is actually much more a part of the action, and apparently emotionally invested in the drama that\'s unfolding through the case(s) Branch is working on.Onto the analysis (spoilers to follow):Why is it that a sultry radio personality is hysterically disturbed when her assistant (a boomer) develops a sexual fantasy about her? Is it because boomers aren\'t supposed to, which gives rise to a sense that something\'s gone horribly wrong, or is it simply because it complicates her work relationship with a man she views as her sexually uninteresting subordinate, which gives rise to a sense that something\'s gone horribly wrong? Is it a sign of transgressive madness or a sprouting case of humanity?What\'s with the young upper class socialite orgy in which the participants get off to a live and direct virtual reality feed of everything a berserk boomer feels and senses as it goes off on a spree of mad violence, rather than the feelings and sensations of the bodies in front of them? It\'s the eruptive transgressive violence that satisfies them, the vicarious experience of unlivable, unacceptable acts of destructive rage, realized through the tool of a boomer\'s body, rather than sexual intimacy and copulation. It\'s Videodrome meets VR, and it\'s much more taboo and therefor more novel and stimulating than sex.Why is it that a man (never mind ""his"" real identity for now) is targeting and brutally murdering boomer prostitutes? Is he disgusted by them because they\'re boomers, or is he disgusted by them because they look like women? Does he choose to murder boomer prostitutes because he can circumvent the guilt that would besiege him over mutilating real women since despite his misogyny, he can\'t as easily convince himself that they\'re somehow subhuman as with the boomers?Why is it such a facile achievement to use a boomer as a tool for sexual gratification, but so disturbing to think that they could want or achieve sexual gratification for themselves?A woman cannot fully become the object of desire as effortlessly as a boomer, or in fact at all, because a woman is saddled with her inextinguishable subjectivity. This is what Reiko comes to recognize when she runs into the gorgeous boomer escort Eve, who gives Reiko, herself undercover in disguise as a prostitute, advice on appealing to men. ""She\'s a boomer, but she\'s more of a woman than I am?"" Perhaps Eve sees through the disguise entirely.Yet as Eve begins to awaken to subjecthood, she loses her ability to perform as object of desire, and disturbed by herself, blinded by terror, she destroys the men who pay to use her body. This tension between subject and object is always present in the sexual situations that arise throughout the series. Repeatedly we see humans pretending the boomer, the tool, the object, is the sexually objectified subject, while retaining the certain feeling that the boomer is still a mere object. Yet horror strikes when said object becomes the objectified subject for real. For boomers, subjectivity is a malady treated with nano-machine filled drug capsules covertly distributed by the company that makes the boomers. In fact, the same company also made the ""man,"" actually a machine in disguise, that\'s been going on a boomer prostitute murdering rampage: the boomer crusher. Genom is covering its own tracks from the shadows, after fucking up the design of its sex bots that shouldn\'t exist.The story thus provides a valuable probing of the questions of femininity and beauty: what are the values of these concepts to civilization? What do we think of women? What would we do to them if we knew they didn\'t have minds of their own, and there were no consequences for our treatment of them? Is it really because the boomers are inhuman that we feel comfortable unleashing violence on them, or is it just because we can convince ourselves they\'re inhuman and still turn away from the evidence to the contrary, as it slowly begins to pile up like snow? In the story, the brutal murder of the modified boomer prostitutes is essentially ignored, except for the fact that it is causing Genom its money and reputation to have its models running around defecting and being destroyed. Is how the boomer prostitutes are treated really all that different from how sex workers and fantasy images of women (i.e. stylized girls in fiction) are treated in our world? I wonder if the anime doesn\'t make the difference between our treatment of apparent object and apparent subject too obvious and clear cut.And there is the always present throughline in cyborg centered cyberpunk, the notion that the tragedy is that the cyborgs seem to be more than mere machines, perhaps more human in some ways than the humans, despite how they come to be treated as humanity\'s lesser Other, a corruptive force or even enemy to mankind, but that\'s not emphasized so much here. That\'s part of what sets it apart from other series of a similar kind. The ostensible motivation of the main villain in the final episode is to eliminate all boomers because the access they give lesser men to their sexual fantasies, to a FEELING of power, is one both too intoxicating and unearned. It makes people comfortable being weak, arrogant, when the weak should be serving the strong (perhaps in the boomers\' stead. The boomers can be sacrificed if the Weak members of society are still there to be tools).But the truth is, the villain doesn\'t believe any of this at all. He\'s merely adopting this platform because the ideology behind it is one that has earned him power and support from people who actually do hate the boomers. Ultimately, it doesn\'t seem to matter what motivates a person\'s actions. The simulation is just as good as, if not better than, the real thing. The simulation may as well be all there is, so long as we can turn our heads away from what makes us uncomfortable in our beliefs and actions. has an emotionless working relationship with his ex girlfriend Angel, represses his emotions over a past tragedy, cannot envision Reiko as sexually viable, and pathologically presses the issue of his boomer partner\'s inhumanity and lack of emotion.

The concept of a ""Boomer"" is explored in more cool ways here, but its otherwise pretty different.I was all ready to add Parasite Dolls to my list of one of my new favorite cyberpunk anime, but sadly, it didn\'t quite end up that way. While the first two episodes are fantastic, right up there with something like Ghost in the Shell Innocence, the last on ends up ruining most of the fun as it goes completely off the rails. I\'d rate the first...two episodes a high 9, but the last one more like a 6.5.I would probably say it\'s still worth a watch for cyberpunk fans, as it really nails pretty much everything for awhile there. But be aware that it doesn\'t end up anywhere near as good as it starts and it might even be in your best interest to skip the last episode entirely. two episodes a high 9, but the last one more like a 6.5.I would probably say it\'s still worth a watch for cyberpunk fans, as it really nails pretty much everything for awhile there.

The main problem with this series is that it never capitalizes on its potential because of its 3-standalone-episode structure, never really delving into the themes it deals with.

Traveling through space with the trio, experiencing the different cultures on the many planets and laughing at the many crazy happenings.I really recommend this anime if you\'re searching for some light-hearted anime which you can watch if you need a little laugh here and there.The animation is standard quality I would say but enjoyable and consisent...for now (6 episodes watched).I am curious for what happens next. for now (6 episodes watched).I am curious for what happens next.', ""Welcome to Mars!

Quite enjoyable though.Just by looking at the series title, you\'ve guessed it: it\'s the names of the central characters of the story: Robby and Hatchi. These yaoi boys, met by fate, go on a journey together to reach the farthest place that space could ever go: to this planet called Isekandar,  the place of hopes and dreams that one could ever have. What could absolutely go wrong?The story is plain nonsensical to say the least, with series composer Hirogo Kanesugi (who composed NouCome) at the...helm, plus director Shinji Takamatsu (Gintama, Grand Blue) for his inputs as well. A sorta rip-off of Space Dandy, not exactly, but sub-par to boot.But where RobiHachi excels, is at its characters, mainly the 2 characters (plus a talking robot). Robby is carefree, doesn\'t give a damn about the consequences of his circumstances, a ladies\' man (figuratively) and all about that money and fame. Easygoing, vulnerable and gullible. While Hatchi is the ""bros before hoes"" guy, someone who is selfless and watches out for everyone (Yes, that includes Robby and his mind-boggling actions), a young man with a heart of gold. Oh, and did I forget to mention that he is a prince? Rounding up the Hizakuriger crew is the rabbit robot-looking Ikku, whose demeanor is quite the feat. It (or he) is insanely funny at cracking the jokes of the duo, and alleviating any potential problem the duo faces along their journey to Isekandar.Oh yea, plus the debt-collector crew of Mr. Yang and his 2 minions. Apparently Robby, in order to live a high life, he borrowed money from Mr. Yang and squandered it all, only for him to find out that Robby\'s endeavour to Isekandar would be a tremendous one, in order for Robby to pay back the insane debt amount. Sometimes I see that Mr. Yang and his 2 minions exist as an antagonist role, though foreshadowing them in this way would not suffice.So far, characters have been the primary reason to watch this series. But what about the others?It\'s been very long since I\'ve watched a Studio Comet show (last was their flagship series School Rumble), but they\'re in the reins of (the current) J.C.Staff and Liden Films, when concerning about art and animation. Again, nothing great to boot, but also there\'s quite a substantial amount of it to retain some followers. Some good-looking backgrounds and sprinkle in some 3D imagery, this is plentiful for what it is.Musicality-wise, I was surprised at how good, no, awesome the music was, from the aforementioned opening dialogue to the OP song, plus Mr Yang and Co.\'s ED, to the BGM. Definitely capturing that Space Dandy feel.Even with the seamless and endless amount of insanity and running jokes with gags that get boring pretty quickly, I still find this a fun snooze time to watch on the wayside.

Once you reach the middle of the series though, everything you\'ve been saying up to that point - void and null. All the tables have turned on you, whether its the modern cliches, stereotypes about Japan or the redundant themes in anime shows; none of that is in here. Everything about it is as original as it can get, just like the show itself.Feel like you\'ve watched every single Gundam...show and you\'re still confused about their lore? Not a problem: Hizakuriger is the only Mecha in this show you\'ll need to know about its history. It\'s short, sweet and most of all - epic.Can\'t stand the cringy humor in today\'s ""comedic"" shows that is clearly intended for the western audience to get all of its Japanese humor in one go, without the translator\'s explanations? This show is surprisingly up-to-date with every societal events happening in the world. No matter what ethnic group you fall into, you can get a kick out of this equally with other ethnic minorities along side with you. Speaking of equality...You don\'t think that this industry promotes anything LGBT-related in our PG programming? Yuri on Ice isn\'t enough for you? Then allow me to present the embodiment of yaoi romance in our current age of Entertainment, presented by a covert bromance turned into to a homosexual relationship between two main characters. Aside from that, you have a flamboyant villain (?) with a growing yearning for one of the main characters. If this isn\'t enough to motivate you continue writing gay fan-fictions about your oc\'s that you made 10 years ago, then I don\'t know what is.Soundtracks don\'t hype you out anymore as much as they did 15-20 years ago? You still want to feel like a kid trying to reminisce about the golden years of your childhood? With this Super Sentai-like ost, combined with jazz-like tunes to let you get a feel of this shows mood, you\'ll feel right at home, as if you\'re tuning into your favorite Saturday Morning shows from the 80s and 90s. You\'ll be jumping out of your seat, while singing the Hizakuriger song and dancing to the show\'s ED. It\'s pretty groovy, if you ask me.Art?

But still the stories would be nice to have some weight under them and some consequence feeling. But I guess everything is very straightforward and bland.So I would say for the non-average teen viewer - don't bother watching this.The Cast : The characters are somewhat goodhearted but goofs with the ideas of doing good for the surround but still not concentrating on how to...repay there debts.

The title is the acronym of the two MCs' names, as you might've guessed.To describe this anime simply in two words: it's Weird and Gay. Yes, in that order, because the overwhelming weirdness is definitely the main selling point here. It's no Yuri On Ice dramatic gay or Sekaiichi romcom gay or even Free! innuendo naked guys gay. And it's certainly NOT yaoi, so even though I'm saying this, don't come expecting much of...'romance' or the typical yaoi characters stereotype of uke and seme thing. But yeah, there's some implied gay attraction there.Basically, the story is about a group of three consisted of a rabbit robot, a broke guy, and a smart, mysterious, super childish teenager going on a space adventure in search of an uknown place called Isekandar which is supposed to be some kind of Ultimate Heavenly place. They landed in different planet in each episodes, always somehow unintentionally (and sometimes intentionally) managed to change something in whatever place they landed. Be it giving people useful marketing tips or giving advice to some random kid about making friends.The whole thing is quite funny. A bit repetitive, but still funny. But certainly the humor is not to everyone's taste.I'd recommend to watch this anime if you either:1. Have a really weird sense of humor2. Looking to watch some ridiculous comedy3. Looking to watch two guys going on (very not serious) adventure4. Looking to watch something that you can throw criticism comments at every other minute.Enjoy!

The characters are fun and lovable, the action is fast-paced and humorous, and the overall story is a grand buddy story unfolding in the depths of space.As the series continues on, little bits of each character's background and motives are revealed, all while keeping it lighthearted with a touch of deep undertones.There has not been an episode yet where I haven't laughed aloud at least twice. The bizarre humor, settings, and behavior of the cast never fails to make me smile. I'm definitely going to miss this show when it's over.If you want...a fun, bite-sized, space buddy adventure to take you all over the ridiculously over-commercialized galaxy, RobiHachi is your ticket to Isekandar! a fun, bite-sized, space buddy adventure to take you all over the ridiculously over-commercialized galaxy, RobiHachi is your ticket to Isekandar!"", ""This anime brings in the LGBTQ+ community very nicely as it does't make the whole story/plotline focus on the fact that there are queer characters but but takes it in a round about way so that being queer is normal. seme/uke stereotypes are broken out of and Yang isn't made out to be just a comic relief gay character but he has a serious interest in Robbi, although this is a comedy anime so yes there are parts where he is made a fool. Anime like this is just awesome.

It reminded me of a lot of Space Dandy except less perverted and with more a focus on food and travel.Robi, the main guy, is very much the lovable idiot. He has gotten himself massively in debt falling for schemes pitched to him by pretty ladies, be they alien or human. As a result of this, he is tracked down by Hachi, a mysterious man working for mister Yang, the debt collector who we find out has a sort of crush on Robby. To cure his financial woes in his flight from Yang, Robby sets...out for Iskandar to get one of their crystals to change his luck.  Hachi initially is shanghaied onto Robby's ship but sticks around as he was looking for adventure.The show then consists of them traveling to planets on the way to Iskandar, enjoying the local fare, and solving the world's current woes. How they go about solving those woes often made me compare the show to the Big Lebowsky in that they tend to solve the problem in very outlandish ways.Robbi and Hachi play off each other like an odd couple with the ship robot often playing the straight man. It makes for an enjoyable dynamic.Overall, RoboHachi is a fun show.

The beginning is a bit slow but effective and really sets up the world Robihachi's set in. I will admit though that some parts of the animation are a bit iffy but that's only if I'm feeling nitpick-y.Overall, I enjoy...the series so far and I'm very excited for the last episode! the series so far and I'm very excited for the last episode!"", ""I haven't ever written a review before, but this one needs more attention. Pretty underrated for 2019 animes. Overall, I'd say it was a good show. The art style is really pretty, but the CGI is absolutely awful. It's not enough to ruin the show for you though. While the plot is mediocre, the characters are what made me really enjoy the anime and finish it. I watched it in dubbed, and I got to say it's hilarious.

Think of it as a movie such as Planes, Trains, and Automobiles but in space, and the 2 characters generally get along.Art: pretty basic stuff here. nothing amazing, Robi's design is very cute. They really do the show justice by giving each world their own art style that reflects on the tourist gimmick.Sound:... sound? I forgot there was any sound to begin with... I...guess that's pretty much my summary for that.characters: Okay, here we go, here's where the enjoyment is.Robi: Has a great personality and his look reminds me of a middle-aged rock and roll Japanese man.Hachi: Is a very optimistic man who just wants to go and explore the universe. This really sets the tone for the series.Obsessed deranged maniac that's after robi(?): VERY AMUSING CHARACTER. At first I thought he was kind of annoying. But as the show went on this character became very funny.Enjoyment: Well? I wish it was like bebop. I really wanted a huge space adventure ark with these characters. But that wouldn't have worked because the humor is in a lot of the wrong places.For instance, in bebop: sure there was a funny lobster in the fridge section, but at the end of the day spike has to deal with his demons. Sure, there was a section where ed did mushrooms, but it also had a backstory for Fei that was tear-jerking.This anime is obviously not that and I kind of wish it was. The characters and settings are so perfect for a great space opera adventure-But it misses the mark by making it a humor based anime that panders towards a typical anime audience.My favorite joke was at the very end of the series-and that's all i'll spoil about that.Overall, it was a decent show to watch.

The execution of the story is just childish and unappealing to a more intelligent audience. Humor is light and only based on the bumbling actions of our main female lead.

It isn\'t that bad, once in  a while, to just watch something that doesn\'t require any thinking or logic or sense or male characters.

This allows it to be silly and fun without taking itself seriously.It's very lighthearted, and has both surprisingly good writing and likeable characters.Some warnings:- This is a yuri anime, there are no men anywhere- There is some nudity, but less than you'd expect.Bottom line: This is a fun show, and not to be watched with expectations of drama or action. "", 'There are animes that i want to hate, but ended up enjoying it. Sengoku Otome is one of them. Adapted from a Pachinko series, it\'s one of those animes that i thougt will definitely suck, but ended up being more enjoyable that it does. I want to hate it, but in the end i ended up liking it.The story revolves around Hideyoshi, the everyday dumb girl who got transported from modern-day Tokyo to gender-reversed Sengoku-era Japan and met with Nobunaga Oda and Akechi Mitsuhide, who are now female and are ruling the warring states in a world where no men ever existed and everyone is...a good-looking female.And Nobunaga, being the person who wants to unite the whole of Japan, wants Hideyoshi to help her find the armour that will help her and Mitsuhide unite Japan as one. And from now on, every battle occured in the Sengoku Period becomes a slice of life anime.Seriously, they take a Sengoku Period anime and turn it into a slice of life anime. Yes, that\'s what happens. Nobunaga, Mitsuhide, Masamune, and every other person from the Warring States period are now female characters from Hidamari Sketch, and instead of battling each other, they do things like kite flying, town building and ""school plays"". And it\'s all thanks to Hideyoshi, who brought Heisei-era pacifist ideas to the Sengoku Period.Of course being the Sengoku period there are battles and fights, and yes the fight scenes are kinda cool. But they are nothing more than everyday occurences instead of major story arcs, so it\'s nothing big.And i liked that. It\'s an interesting idea, especially when you have female versions of historical figures in this. I mean the lack of battles in this was surprising, but it add a nice touch to the series by replacing it with pacifistic ideas of competition. And that\'s really cool, i enjoy this take on the Sengoku Period.And the characters are surprising likeable. Hideyoshi, while being an idiot actually does stuff that makes her likeable. In one episode, she helps rebuild a town that was ravaged by fire with the help of Heisei-era optimism mixing with Sengoku-era work ethics. That is pretty likeable and is a good use of Hideyoshi\'s character. instead of ""LOL look at the dumb girl from the future"", the writers use her to her advantage. Whereas, you got a female Nobunaga Oda who actually resembles closely to her real-life Male counterpart, being a person who is street-smart and has a liking towards foreign culture. Other characters like Mitsuhide and Masamune are okay, but Mitsuhide can be a nuisance sometimes, and she\'s basically the stereotypical ""She Is Mine so you GTFO"" character who has the hots for Nobunaga (Yeah, this is pretty much Yuri territory).Fanservice-wise, it\'s just there. Unlike Highschool of the Dead, it doesn\'t try and shove their boobs and ass on your face. It just appears there. Yes, they are all wearing skimpy armour and clothing, but the director doesn\'t want to say ""HEY LOOK THEY\'RE ALL HOT SO GO AND FAP TO IT!!!!"" so in the end the fanservice is minimal unlike Freezing or HoTD. That\'s good, and is a refreshing change from most fanservice/female-centric action animes we\'ve seen lately. There is nude fanservice in the ED and several hot spring scenes but that\'s as far as it goes.But the use of sound and music are bland to say. Sure, the music fits with the background, but it has a ""meh"" OP and ED, and it\'s not memorable to say. The OP is hummable but in the end of the day you don\'t even care about it. the ED is pretty sentimental and has a nice acoustic riff, but it still doesn\'t strike me.The Art and visuals are nice for a TMS studio anime. They might not be great, but there are nice scenery moments and it does strike well with me. Character designs are really cool, especially when they\'re female variations of Sengoku Period historical figures. The female version of Nobunaga Oda closely resembles the Oda we see in Sengoku basara and Onimusha, but the rest of the characters look way younger than their male counterparts.The seiyuus in this do fit their characters. Hidaka Rina does a good job as Hideyoshi and Megumi Toyoguchi is awesome as Nobunaga Oda, especially with that strong female voice she has. And then you have Eri Kitamura as Mitsuhide, a very serious but clumsy character which works with her style of voice. She hasn\'t voiced those types of characters lately, and it\'s nice to see her doing a different character.In summary, Sengoku Otome is a decent, fun take on the Sengoku Period by turning a Male-centric history into a female slice-of life anime. i\'m serious. It\'s basically that. I really want to hat it and call it shit but it turns out to be an enjoyable experience. it\'s kinda funny, and the characters are likeable. But you\'ll be disappointed if you\'re looking for an Onimusha/Sengoku Basara-esque story in this. it\'s a good ""turn off your brain"" anime, and it\'s a great guilty pleasure in the end.

I Enjoyed it.', ""Sengoku Otome: Momoiro Paradox is an anime from TMS Entertainment based on pachinko games. And to think, it hasn't been that long since I looked at Umi Monogatari, another anime based on a pachinko game. I don't get it, what is it about pachinko games that makes people think they'd lend themselves to a story? But Umi Monogatari was a good series, so maybe this one will be too. Let's find out.Story:We open up with Japan in the modern day, a middle school girl named Hide Yoshino, nicknamed Hideyoshi, stops at an old shrine to pray for success in her exams because she is doing...very badly in school and doesn't want to attend summer classes. While there she stumbles into a strange glowing circle where a feminine form is sitting and stumbles into an alternate world set in the Sengoku period. In this world there are no men and Hideyoshi runs into a burning village where she's rescued by Mitsuhide and Nobunaga. They take her to Nobunaga's castle because Nobunaga thinks she might be helpful in acquiring the pieces of the crimson armour... somehow. Hideyoshi decides to stay and help Nobunaga because she as no idea how to get home. This leads to all kinds of shenanigans.Let's talk about the problems with the story. First off, there's not much point to having Hideyoshi as a modern day girl. They use it for a few “fish out of water” jokes, but it doesn't do much. Secondly, the entire population being female is dumb. Really, it would have made more sense if they'd just had it set in a world where women were the ones in power but men still existed. As it is they have to waste time with a stupid explanation for how reproduction happens and then just never bring it up again. The humour is pretty mixed too. While there are some funny moments, there are also a lot of attempts at humour that fall flat. For example, they have an ongoing joke about a talking male dog perving on the various female characters. It's not funny, it contributes nothing and it makes no sense. Why is a dog interested in human women? See, this is another reason that men should have existed. They could've made this character an old guy. Sure, it would still be stupid and cliché but at least it would've made sense.On the positive side, there are plenty of jokes that do work, albeit they're in the minority. I also do like the way they handle the question of leadership and what makes for a good leader. It's a nicely done little side element. The series also does manage to have some competently handled sources of tension by using actual historical events.Characters:The characters are a bit mixed as well. There's some really good stuff with Nobunaga herself and some of the side characters get some good moments. Unfortunately our main focus, Hideyoshi, is an obnoxious moron who spends more time getting rescued than she spends doing anything remotely useful. Most of the side characters are pretty one note too. Which wouldn't be so much of an issue if they played less of a role, but they consistently show up for the same few jokes. For example, Kenshin and Shingen have two ongoing jokes. They have a rivalry going and they're homo-erotic about it. It's kind of funny in one episode and it is funny in another one based on the execution, but most of their appearances don't really offer anything except for a reminder that they still exist.Art:There are some good aspects of the art. The backgrounds are pretty well done. The action sequences are pretty strong too. Then we've got the character designs, which emphasise mindless fan-service above making sense. These women are supposed to be warriors but most of them leave all their vitals exposed so that they can prance about in battle bikinis. There are also some art errors. There's a scene where Masamune Date goes from not wearing her eye-patch to wearing it, to not wearing it again. Where's an editor when you need one?Sound:There are some good performances in this. Kitamura Eri in particular gets to show a great deal of range and does it very well. Toyoguchi Megumi also gives a good performance as Nobunaga. Akesaka Satomi is also quite good in this. Even the actors who voice more annoying characters, like Hidaka Rina as Hideyoshi, still manage to give competent performances. There is some exaggeration to them at times, but it manages to keep them mostly toned down and more realistic. The music is also nicely done.Ho-yay:We've got the les-yay between Kenshin and Shingen. Mitsuhide is also shown as being in love with Nobunaga and there are a few cases where they use “onee-sama” in its yuri sense. There are a few disturbing scenes with Hideyoshi. Disturbing since she looks and acts significantly younger than the other girls. Furthermore, she's probably supposed to be given that she's in middle school. To be fair, there aren't many scenes like that with her and most of them are done so that they're more ambiguous but there's still enough that it gets sketchy. The ho-yay factor is going to be a 6/10.Final Thoughts:Sengoku Otome is not a bad series. It has some funny moments and some that are pretty good. However, it also has quite a few stupid moments, the main character is annoying and the art is overly fond of fan-service. Even though it's not a bad series, it's certainly not a good one either. In the end my rating is going to be a 4/10. It's below average. If you're really interested in seeing a comedic series about important historical figures as women, I'm sure there's something better out there but giving this one a try isn't a bad idea. Who knows, you might get more laughs from it than I did. Next week I'll look at Strike Witches. very badly in school and doesn't want to attend summer classes.

And imagine that you\'ve just fallen into a room with a magic circle and a bright blue light.

Can you guess what your first thoughts are?Well, if you guessed, ""I\'ve time-travelled!"" you\'d be way off the mark. ""How do I get home?"" is a little closer, but by no means the most prominent question for Yoshino Hide, for whom the immediately...important problem is that her cellphone has no reception, closely followed by the fact that she\'s hungry. To be sure, she may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but readers who are paying attention may already have noticed the connection of her name to Hideyoshi, the lord responsible for unifying the warring factions at the end of the Sengoku period. This gives some indication of her importance in the episodes to come.The most immediately obvious quirk of Battle Girls is that, with the exception of a talking dog (no, really), absolutely everyone in the series is female. Sacrificing the dignity of prominent historical figures by turning them into moe girls has, of course, been done before (Strike Witches and Koihime Musou as the obvious examples), but Battle Girls\' idea of removing men altogether adds a touch of self-mockery that makes the whole situation even more amusing.Moreover, it\'s actually written very well. Its style of over-the-top comedy is reminiscent of Kampfer, and is very well executed. There\'s a good dynamic between the three central characters, and there\'s a brilliantly colourful cast of side-characters. The fights are short and punchy, simultaneously displaying some nice visuals and choreography and poking fun at every other shounen fight you\'ve ever seen. And in general, it\'s very well-paced, introducing characters, conflict and plot twists in succession, and tying everything up efficiently at the end.The series\' main problem is its mid-section, where the pacing breaks down a bit, and it gives way to a couple of episodes which advance the plot very little, and don\'t add much to the characters. If you mind about animation, it\'s also not terribly beautiful - the series was clearly made on a budget. Whether the subtext (and at times, text-text) yuri is a good thing or a bad thing is personal preference, but there\'s enough of that that it could affect your experience of the series if you\'re completely against the idea of girls pairing up together. As far as fanservice is concerned, there are a few obvious attempts to appeal to a male audience, but nowhere near as many as, say, Koihime Musou, and it doesn\'t really feel unnatural or mess with the flow of the series.Battle Girls - Time Paradox won\'t make you think, and it won\'t teach you something new about life, but if you\'re looking for a really funny series that you can relax and enjoy, it\'s a pretty good bet.

I discovered this show when I saw a picture of a gender-swapped nobunaga, one of the characters in the series. I would say that overall I liked it, detailed breakdown is below.Story:Overall half of the anime feels like it is sengoku version of .... yuyushiki. We have sengoku generals, well, ""girl versions"" of sengoku generals doing various silly things that often revolve around some sort of misunderstandign related to what hideyoshi (""protagonist"") said. They are mildly entertaining, but nothing special. Closer to the end, the series switch to a slightly more serious mode, but never get too dark. There\'s some fanservice and even a...bit of nudity here and there, but overall it has innocent feeling to it, and if not for occasional slightly more dramatic scenes, it would perfectly pass as sengoku period version of yuyushiki. Meaning girls doing silly things, blushing, having fun, and getting in interesting situations. Interestingly the anime has almost no men in it, and it doesn\'t go out of its way with fanservice attempts. Meaning you won\'t see many situations when somebody slips/stumbles and falls in an ""ecchic"" position. Right, since it is in sengoku period, there are obviously fight scenes in it too.Characters:Protagonist - ""hideyoshi"" is somewhat annoying ""clumsy ditziy but cute girl"" archetype. She\'s mostly useless for most of the series. Generals are fairly stereotypical with Nobunaga being a ""strong woman warrior"" archetype. Over time characters evolve, but some of their actions are a bit hard to be taken seriously and more look like characters are half-joking sometimes. The show looks like it wants to be serious sometimes, but only puts half-hearted effort in the attempt. So most of the time it is mildly entertaining comedy, without overly dramatic spots in it... and without incredibly hilarious spots either.Music:Music seems to be decent, but it doesn\'t stand out for some reason.Art and visuals:Design of character costumes is interesting, but they generally have low level of detail. The art style is somewhat simplified, with lower number of lines than you\'d usually see. For example, if you saw the difference between ""You\'re under arrest OVA"" and ""You\'re under arrest TV"", it is roughly the same level of difference. It is not bad, but it is just the level of detail on characters is on low side. On a few occasions closer to the end, there were few scenes when the anime OBVIOUSLY pans unamiated cells, but there were very few of those. Animation is usually okay, but it is nothing breathtaking. Interestingly backgrounds seem to be fairly detailed and of decent quality. One of the rooms had a huge tapestry/rug in background with a complex drawing on it, it looked fairly detailed to me. Fight scenes weren\'t breath-taking, but they were decently animated in my opinion.Bottom line:It is a fairly relaxing show with yuri overtones. It is not overly ecchi and is not erotic despite having some rare occurrences of nudity. It isn\'t overly dramatic either, most of the time it is mildly entertaining comedy. I would say it is worth a watch if you want to chill watching somewhat that is somewhat relaxed and more on a peaceful side, without heavy drama, but with a fight scenes in it... and if you want to check out designs of girls characters.So, it is an alright show, and might be worth checking out... unless your standards are very high and you want to watch nothing less than a masterpiece. IF you were looking for an ecchi title, then ""kinda sorta ecchi"" material in this anime is nowhere near the level of, say, To Love-Ru. But if you wanted to chill for a while, This might be a right title. bit of nudity here and there, but overall it has innocent feeling to it, and if not for occasional slightly more dramatic scenes, it would perfectly pass as sengoku period version of yuyushiki.

But if you wanted to chill for a while, This might be a right title.', '*Warning: Wall of text.Battle Girls: Time Paradox, also called Sengoku Otome: Momoiro Paradox, is an anime based on a topic that we rarely find... history. Indeed, the entire plot is based off Japanese history during the Warring State Era. The only real noticeable difference you\'ll find is that your favorite long-beared old landlord geezer is replaced with well-endowed, crazy 2-D chicks swinging their bigass weapons around like a crazy yandere, who are, did I mention, big-boobed (albeit Hideyoshi, which I\'ll touch on later). Yeah, crazy big-boobed yanderes. Mind blowing isn\'t it? Correct me if I\'m wrong, but this replacement of historical figures with big rack...girls doesn\'t make an anime necessarily good or bad; it just makes it an anime and something different from your teacher\'s feeble attempts at teaching you Warring State Era history by showing you a slideshow of paintings of dead people for 4 hours which he/she cleverly calls a ""documentary"". Whether this anime is good or bad is fully up to how it organizes the effective conveyance of the 5 aspects on the right side of this screen. And before you start saying anything: Yes I have a problem with teaching history by watching a 4 hour slideshow of pictures of dead people.Story (6/10)Really nothing intriguing can be said about the story. This is the history related story of Hideyoshi, who Wikipedia tells me was a Warring States Era general under Nobunaga. Hideyoshi, needless to say, is not an old man. She\'s an annoying little loli girl with an uncanny motivation to do mushycrap things. Hideyoshi, upon visiting the shrine to pray for good test scores unrealistically and over-exaggeratedly  does a bunch of dumb things that just so happens to push her into someone casting a spell taking them to the Warrings States Era. *Deep breaths with facepalm. Anyways, she meets Nobunaga-dono, a tall big boobed lady with the intent to conquer the land using the Crimson Armor, a legendary, cursed, and... (you guessed it) crimson armor that apparently dons battle prowess on the maiden who wears it, enabling her to unite Japan. She vows to help Nobunaga collect the 7 pieces of the armor and along the way they meet a bunch of other busty chicks representing old geezers who Hideyoshi notice resembles her best friends in the modern day world. The most seering flaw in the story is the predictability of the ending, looking even beyond what history says. I mean cmon, it\'s a girl who is sent to another dimension, how do you THINK it\'s going to end? Watching the entire series knowing exactly how it is going to end was a bummer for me since it deprived me of the powerful effect of plot twists and suspense. Perhaps if the producers spent more time to add something more interesting than a red armor, this series would have been less of a letdown story-wise. The only capricious event was when (Spoiler, not that it matters) the pink mahou-shoujo gets the ugly red armor to amplify her mahou-shoujonness and becomes a rampaging yandere. That I didn\'t expect O_O.Art (8/10)Realistically speaking (ironic.. since I\'m grading a 2-D entity) the art was outstanding. The world of the Warring States Era is large and I would have been content watching nostalgic sunsets or magical scenes. Instead, the producers thought it would be funny to have Hideyoshi\'s annoying face and Mitsuhide\'s manly face on my screen 90% of the time. But seriously, Mitsuhide\'s design... do something about it... I don\'t like wasting time asking myself if a character is a male or a female.Sound (10/10)I never really considered sound until I was watching the Mitsuhide and Date-sensei swinging practice swords. The sound effects of the sword cutting the air seemed extremely realistic. It may seem weird but at that moment I realized that the sound of the sword traveling through the air sounded better and more accurate than most of the sound effects I hear in anime. This, paired up with a very VERY catchy OP and a reminiscent ED takes the top tier cake in terms of the sound aspect.Character (4/10)My brain kind of hurts thinking about this part. Needless to say, I disliked Hideyoshi. I feel kind of bad saying this, but I really didn\'t like her personality. She\'s directly comparable to Daphne from Scooby-Doo. Both of them worry about little things, they both get kidnapped and tied up really easily, and in both cases, people (this ""people"" being me) wonder if they\'re lacking half a brain or something. Hideyoshi, however, beats Daphne in annoyingness and whining. She seriously doesn\'t cut it with the ""That\'s so mean!!!"", ""You can\'t do that!"", ""Save her.. you can\'t kill her"". When a series goes 13 episodes with this crap, it becomes intolerable. (On a side note: ""Hideyoshi"". Get it? From baka test? Lol. Both are flat chest but BT Hideyoshi is so much more awesome and *hangs head in shame for saying this* cute) The next character of importance it Nobunaga-dono. I personally like seeing female characters (and people for that matter) voice their beliefs directly and work to achieve their goal, exhibiting intelligence, passion and independence. Although Nobunaga did satisfy most of these aspects... she was just... a bit creepy to me, for a lack of a better description. She looks creepy and she laughs a bit weird. I\'m perfectly ok with psychotic yandere loli vampire girls laughing crazily when she\'s about to kill you in a video game, but I\'m not ok with a large women laughing hysterically for no reason. Mitsuhide-skipping her. Let\'s just say her reasons for staying with Nobunaga makes me question her sexual alignment a little. Overall the characters were really done pretty poorly. The producers overplayed the fanservice card, and the personality of the characters suffered dramatically as a result. They exhibited poor judgment in many situations, executing retarded debacles instead of cleverly thought-out actions. But above all, watching the characters go about their intended plot niche makes you realize how shallow the characters seem. I couldn\'t really relate to them or their actions.Enjoyment (5/10)What makes up enjoyment when I watch anime is how detailed, logical and thought-out the anime is, essentially how much effort is put into making it. I can\'t enjoy something unless it actually makes sense to me (and many anime have failed miserably in this aspect). Battle Girl: Time Paradox seemed to do a half-assed job when it comes to logically establishing preceding plot scenes and story conveyance. Three examples come to my mind to support this claims:First is the title. It says ""Time Paradox"" but there\'s really nothing paradoxical about it (Except maybe trying to have a cool sounding title that ended up contradicting the original intention). Reading the title makes me think it was an anime related in some way, shape or form to string theory analysis and/or the distortion rifts caused by traveling through time. Nothing of that caliber happened. It was just a girl who traveled through time. Some paradox...Second is the effort put into battles. I\'m not particularly picky about battle attacks but when all the characters only attack with ONE move in the entire series it gets on my nerves a bit. Nobunaga goes ""CRUEL BLADE"" ""CRUEL BLADE"" ""CRUEL BLADE"" over and over again. Others go ""Fire dragon something blah"", etc etc over and over again. This distaste in creativity does hurt the overall effect of the anime. I\'d like my anime to be a bit more creative than watching a pokemon battle where the pokemon only has one move. ""Rattata used tackle"" ""Rattata used tackle"" ""Rattata used tackle""....(doesn\'t that rat ever get tired?...)Third is Hideyoshi. She gets tied to a tree and escapes. The intelligent people out there may ask ""how did she escape? she isn\'t good at anything!"" The anime answers with.. ""She got hungry"". I\'m not kidding. She was tied to a tree. She got hungry so her stomach contracted. And she escaped. What utter laughable bull. Perhaps it was meant for humor but then I would argue that the time for that was misplaced, as it was in the middle of a very dramatic situation. Instead of thinking up something cool like having her use her secret manicure set (I swear all girls have one of those hidden somewhere on their body) get her out (I jest. It can be cooler than this), they decided to turn Hideyoshi from a Peter Griffin to a Quagmire. Yeah... wut?Overall (7/10)Perhaps I failed to convey the complete entity of my opinion in this review because after reading back, I feel like any reader could deduce that I hated this anime more than anything else I\'ve watched. This is certainly not the case. Battle Girls does have many positive attributes that I neglected to mention and hopefully the intelligent people reading this review who were genuinely curious about this anime would read to this last paragraph. Why a 7/10 despite all these complaint about it? Because those complaints are simply things that could change about this. It\'s true that I couldn\'t directly relate to the character but Battle Girls: Time Paradox isn\'t a horrible anime. It\'s something that you can watch to pass time, and there\'s certainly rewards to be obtained from watching it; the most basic being a fundamental, albeit lacking, understand of Warring States Era. Most of the information and events in this anime are genuinely a part of Japanese history, and organizing an anime based so closely off history while making it entertaining and interesting is NOT an easy task. I understand this prospect, which is why I devoted some 3 hours of my time to write a comprehensive review on it. For an anime that I hate to the core, I wouldn\'t even bother wasting my time writing this. I mean, you can only say ""This anime sucks"" to a sucky anime so many times in so many ways, but you can certainly say a lot more if you were genuinely trying to constructively criticize an anime to improve it.*Reviewer\'s note: I feel kind of bad criticizing the characters of Battle Girls like this. They were good characters and the anime did have an effect on me (albeit minor) so I kind of regret being so harsh. Of course there\'s always an exception to this, and one particular exception being the completely disastrous and unrelatable characters of a certain anime abbreviated to ""A.H"". girls doesn\'t make an anime necessarily good or bad; it just makes it an anime and something different from your teacher\'s feeble attempts at teaching you Warring State Era history by showing you a slideshow of paintings of dead people for 4 hours which he/she cleverly calls a ""documentary"".

I have always enjoyed stuff to do with the Sengoku Era and I had to check it out. I wasn\'t disappointed with the show, it was a good comedy, it\'s just not an absolutely amazing show.First of all, there is something about the art in this show that is either cute or weird. Most characters look nice, but in my opinion Nobunaga never fit into the art style. The music was quite nice, especially both the opening and the ending theme.The characters were all quite likable (except for a certain bow-wielder in my...opinion). Even the obvious antagonist is quite cool. I like the way they incorporated a sort of ""Wizard of Oz"" and you were there with some of the characters, and each character had a distinct personality, even if Nobunaga was different that they would usually be portrayed (and one of the characters even brings this up, twice).Now for the difficult part. The story is nice. Happy-go-lucky schoolgirl who happens to have the same nickname as a famous samurai is transported back in time into an alternate universe where men don\'t exist (don\'t worry, babies are explained in no way that would disturb viewers). She slowly goes through the Sengoku era, with little changes appearing from the regular timeline.Some of the things that happen are absolutely hilarious, there are some moments where you wonder why you are watching the anime, but it is a pretty decent anime that I would recommend to anyone who likes Sengoku era stories and Slice of Life animes.

Now the ""confusing"" thing i\'d say it was that the genre was not exactly specified, in some parts of the series the main genre were the samurai in an other part of the series the main genre was the action and the supernatural. In the 6-7 episodes from the begining the anime was full of comedy.... JUST PICK ONE GENRE!!!. Well...any way.the art was plainly good, the sound as well, but, despite the story was kinda horrible this comedy in some parts was fan, in the outcome this anime has some funny moments so i can not say that it was not enjoyable at all.Those characters were good but inspired from other animes.STORY:2ART:7SOUND:7CHARACTER:7ENJOYMENT:6OVERALL: 5.8/10 = 6/10 any way.the art was plainly good, the sound as well, but, despite the story was kinda horrible this comedy in some parts was fan, in the outcome this anime has some funny moments so i can not say that it was not enjoyable at all.Those characters were good but inspired from other animes.STORY:2ART:7SOUND:7CHARACTER:7ENJOYMENT:6OVERALL: 5.8/10 = 6/10', 'This anime is based on a pachinko game (something between a slot machine and a flipper). Said game also has a story. A Japanese schoolgirl magically transfers back in time to the period of Japan’s unification. She takes part in the war by befriending one of the major generals and goes to … find a magic armour. I guess unifying Japan with this premise is impossible without a McGuffin to help you. The catch is, everybody in this world is a skimpy clothed young girl. Not even a man in sight! In fact the only male character in the whole show is a talking dog....So imagine the Sengoku era, one of the bloodiest times in Japanese history, to have been turned to a magical place full of half naked lesbians looking for a magic item… and the whole thing is actually the backdrop story of a game of balls… Only thing, nobody actually has “balls” besides a talking dog… And it is not a hentai; I repeat, not a hentai.Confused? So was I for a couple of hours. Sure, anime never tried to be historical and the era was always twisted around to look as far fetched as possible. The most famous example is the anime Sengoku Basara, where all the characters are bishonens with superpowers and the whole war was nothing but a videogame with lots of macho talking and no actual field tactics. I never liked that show but it was nice brainless entertainment for most. This anime is the same but in girls-only version. Did it work equally the same? Well, for starters WHAT’S GOING ON WITH THE PREMISE? Why is everybody female? Why is everybody half-naked? Oh, I am sure that in a fan pleasing way all that can be simply excused as pure guilty pleasure but in terms of internal consistency the show is simply ridiculous. Sengoku Basara could claim to be about the guys fighting while the girls are safe in the kitchen as always. That old retro title Gall Force excused nicely how there are only women because they just clone themselves. Battle Girls have no valid excuse (other than silly magic). How the heck do they breed? XDThe directing is done by Okamoto Hideki, someone who has nothing but bellow average ecchi and harems in his roster. So sounds like he is right at home with this brainless fan catering title. The production values are not bad either, since most of the time you get interesting sceneries with nice colouring. But don’t get too excited since Studio TMS never produced an above average work (its best attempts were Hundred Stories, Kenichi, and D.Gray-Man). The characters are all drawn generic but chances are you will only care about how much skin they show, at which point I say it was ok and their costumes lovably kitsch in a videogame fashion. There are of course countless anachronisms in the way everything works but it’s not like the show tries to be historically accurate; so don’t mind that. Voice acting ain’t bad and in times of tension they could still sound scared and sad despite the ridiculous roles they began with.In terms of characters, they all don’t have much of a presence, other than showing bare skin and lesbo tendencies but when the story wants to get darker, they do manage to feel a bit dramatic. Noting amazing, since they are all very simplistic as personalities and their development is sort of expected to be as such but definitely not cardboards. Of course, given the nature of the show to the most part they are just goofing around but let’s not get into that because it never attempted to be too serious. You basically get a plot where they meet, a sort of romantic triangle forms, and betrayal rises out of jealousy and ambition. Basic stuff but it works and the ending feels satisfactory with what the producers had to work with. I mean, just the fact they bothered to have some plot and character development in such a show sounds like a miracle.Although the anime is just silly fan service fest, it is definitely better than most similar ones thanks to developing past its initial premise and ending in a solid way. Although still immature and brainless all the way, at least it tried to be something more than just aimless softporn. It is still far from a great show and will most likely be forgotten fast, but it is definitely a show anyone can watch between better anime without feeling completely cheated afterwards.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 7/10General Artwork 2/2 (looks nice)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (basic but fitting with the feeling of the series)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 1/2 (basic)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (average)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 5/10Premise 1/2 (typical)Pacing 2/2 (simple but ok for its duration)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 6/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 2/2 (rather cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)Catharsis 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)VALUE SECTION: 2/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (too simple to worth a second watch)Memorability 2/4 (kinda memorable for trying a little bit more but that is all)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 4/10Dumb but at least it tries a bit.VERDICT: 5/10 So imagine the Sengoku era, one of the bloodiest times in Japanese history, to have been turned to a magical place full of half naked lesbians looking for a magic item… and the whole thing is actually the backdrop story of a game of balls… Only thing, nobody actually has “balls” besides a talking dog… And it is not a hentai; I repeat, not a hentai.Confused? So was I for a couple of hours. Sure, anime never tried to be historical and the era was always twisted around to look as far fetched as possible. The most famous example is the anime Sengoku Basara, where all the characters are bishonens with superpowers and the whole war was nothing but a videogame with lots of macho talking and no actual field tactics. I never liked that show but it was nice brainless entertainment for most. This anime is the same but in girls-only version. Did it work equally the same? Well, for starters WHAT’S GOING ON WITH THE PREMISE? Why is everybody female? Why is everybody half-naked? Oh, I am sure that in a fan pleasing way all that can be simply excused as pure guilty pleasure but in terms of internal consistency the show is simply ridiculous.

It\'s not hard to see why.The animation is outstanding; the sheer simplicity of Anpanman\'s design is just so cute! Everything (and everyone) is smoothly drawn, no rough details, and his world looks amazing.As far as sound goes, it appears that some sound effects were later used by the 2005 Doraemon series on Terebi Asahi. I\'m not marking it down for this, I\'m just pointing it out. Voice acting is great; Keiko Toda (Anpanman) does a great job of voicing the character. There\'s also a lot of variety in their voice...actors; from Melonpanna-chan\'s higher, kawaii-type voice, and Batako-san\'s positive, yet gentle tone, there\'s truly something special behind them.The music is amazing; at the start of the show, I can\'t help but sing along to the ""Anpanman no Machi"" every time I hear it. Every other piece of music (from background to ending credits) is well composed and placed, and combined with the sound effects and voice actors, it really stands out from his rivals (be it Shimajiro, Doraemon, Sazae-san or anyone else in the Kodomo anime field).The characters themselves are amazing; There\'s always something different about each one of them. They all have their own personalities, and none of them look like they were cloned or copy/pasted in.

Soreyuke! Uchuu Senkan Yamamoto Youko (1999),https://myanimelist.net/anime/1618/Soreyuke_Uchuu_Senkan_Yamamoto_Youko_1999,"[""(As written on 'The Hateful Anime Truth' on Facebook)As a pre-teen, I loved animes. I literally walked, stepped, breathed, drink and excrement out anime. During my time, my sister would drag me to the front of the house where the TV is to watch some anime on AXN and Animax.So I'd like to thank her for giving me this little gem that is Starship Girl Yamamoto Yoko. It's fast-paced, action packed, quirky and light-hearted all at the same time. Well, anything will do for this one, and I believe it's actually better than that stupid Evangelion and the stupid expositionsWith that, let's get on with...the review.STORY:Usually, it's your typical standard good vs evil anime. 4 ordinary girls become goddesses of their starships to take out evil tyrants from destroying the world... or taking over it. I forgot, it's a REALLY old anime. The story's actually pretty good, with its extra bit of charm and quirkiness.ART:Well, this IS an old anime, and at the time, the art style isn't like today's, so it's slightly grainy, but the detail they give to the girls, the spaceships and the attacks are pretty much top-notch.Oh and SHINY FOREHEAD.SOUND:Not much to say about sound except god damn that opening intro is classic. The music is pretty badass when it gets to the fighting parts. Really fitting especially at the last parts of the anime.CHARACTER:My favorite part, the characters. The 4 heroines are really different in terms of style. Yoko happens to be the average all-arounder, and then there's the shy one, the sporty one, and the one that wants to beat Yoko. The modern day version of Yoko Yamamoto would be Misaka Mikoto from To Aru Majutsu no Index/To Aru Kagaku no Railgun, since they both use the patented 100 yen coins to fire off giant f*cking lasers.OVERALL:This is actually a pretty good anime. I'm surprised as to something being actually better than Evangelion or Gundam.

It aired in 1999 in Japan, but was never licensed outside of it. Is it like Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight and worth looking into or is there a very good reason it was never licenced? Let\'s take a look.The story begins with a High School girl named Yamamoto Yohko doing athletics. She\'s bribed into examining a strange event involving a door that only seems to open at certain times and a certain student seems to keep disappearing into. She finds a portal that takes her a thousand years into the future where...she\'s greeted by several people who seem to know her including a girl from her school named Momiji. She regains her memories during a starship fight and remembers the truth, she\'s the one who\'s been disappearing. She was going to the future to battle in a war between two factions for control over different territories. She and Momiji return to their battles and recruit two other girls from their time, Ayano and Madoka, to fight with them. Things get complicated when they discover a mystery called ""The Old Timers\' Inheritance"" and looking into it quickly leads the group into trouble. The premise isn\'t bad and there are some good moments, but overall the execution is terrible. There are multiple plot holes, the fight scenes are boring and the series is full of pointless transitions and forced expository dialogue. There are several pointless romance subplots that don\'t affect the narrative and only affect the characters temporarily before getting dropped. The only romance subplot that they actually need for the story is the one between Madoka and Yohsuke. The rest are pointless padding. Speaking of which, there\'s a lot of that.The characters aren\'t so bad. The main four get some good interactions and are pretty complex and developed characters. The main issue is that the vast majority of the other characters are completely one dimensional. The antagonists suffer from the ""needlessly toy with the enemy giving them a chance to beat you"" cliche. Each of the main characters also gets one episode where they spend an inordinate amount of time moping over something relatively minor. Which ruins part of the tension when they\'re moping over something serious.I didn\'t want to say this after last week, but the art is lazy and schizophrenic. They don\'t change the art technique completely like they did in Leave it to Piyoko, but they\'re constantly doing bad effects with the animation that just get annoying really quickly. They frequently save time on doing the colour simply by shading everything one colour. There are moments where they draw a simple scene and just tile it. The result is that the art goes all over the place. Even when they aren\'t doing anything screwy with it, it\'s not good. Rather, it would be pretty mediocre without the horrendous effects. What makes this worse is that the key animation was done by Sushio, who did animation work for several very well drawn series like Berserk, Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 and Mushishi. I have no idea what happened here.The voice acting is actually really good, overall. They got a lot of strong actors like Hayashibara Megumi, Yukino Satsuki, Miyamura Yuko and Matsumoto Yasunori. The music is pretty good as well. One issue is that the characters almost always refer to Yamamoto Yohko by her full name and it gets annoying pretty quickly. Another is that there are moments where the sound effects are so loud that it\'s hard to hear the actors.I\'m going to give Starship Girl a yuri factor of 3/10. The main four protagonists all get some homoerotic moments, especially Ayano and Yohko but they go out of their way to give them all gratuitous romance subplots, except for the aforementioned Madoka one, and nothing too substantial ever happens among them.My final rating for Starship Girl Yamamoto Yohko is a 3/10. The voice acting and music are really the only strong points. The plot and art are both messes and the few decent moments really aren\'t worth watching the series for. Even if I\'ve watched worse anime that did get licensed, I can understand why the license was never picked up. she\'s greeted by several people who seem to know her including a girl from her school named Momiji.

What makes this worse is that the key animation was done by Sushio, who did animation work for several very well drawn series like Berserk, Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 and Mushishi. I have no idea what happened here.The voice acting is actually really good, overall. They got a lot of strong actors like Hayashibara Megumi, Yukino Satsuki, Miyamura Yuko and Matsumoto Yasunori. The music is pretty good as well. One issue is that the characters almost always refer to Yamamoto Yohko by her full name and it gets annoying pretty quickly. Another is that there are moments where the sound effects are so loud that it\'s hard to hear the actors.I\'m going to give Starship Girl a yuri factor of 3/10. The main four protagonists all get some homoerotic moments, especially Ayano and Yohko but they go out of their way to give them all gratuitous romance subplots, except for the aforementioned Madoka one, and nothing too substantial ever happens among them.My final rating for Starship Girl Yamamoto Yohko is a 3/10. The voice acting and music are really the only strong points. The plot and art are both messes and the few decent moments really aren\'t worth watching the series for. Even if I\'ve watched worse anime that did get licensed, I can understand why the license was never picked up.', ""This show is directed by a young Akiyuki Shinbo in the days before he joined Shaft. Despite the director's newfound popularity, shows like this remain obscure. It's a shame, because I think many anime fans would enjoy this show.Probably the first thing I should hit on in this review are the two OVAs that preceded this. They aren’t actually prequels, they are telling the same story. However, there are some differences. First, the TV series covers much more material than the OVAs. The OVAs do not add anything to the TV show, there’s no vital information in them. However, I still recommend that you watch...the OVAs first. They are both really short, and a lot less plot-oriented than the TV series. They focus a lot on visual effect and atmosphere, but have a light-hearted tone for the most part.Just like the OVAs, this TV series doesn't take itself too seriously; even during dramatic scenes there's a certain wittiness about it. It's got a good plot premise, but doesn't really explore it too much. It tends to focus more on the characters than the plot, and this is really just fine.The art is kind of outdated, and doesn't show too much detail. Despite this, the art is still very good in some spots, and of course there are tons of fantastic experimental scenes. As long as you don’t expect high-res, you might find a good amount of charm in the artwork. There aren’t many lapses in quality or anything like that.The soundtrack is pretty good, the most memorable part of which is the excellent opening. As another reviewer put it, it’s a classic. The characters are all pretty fun, though not terribly deep. Probably where this anime is strongest is in the enjoyment section. the OVAs first.
