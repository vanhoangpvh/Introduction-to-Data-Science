Harlock Saga is a loose retelling of Wagner\'s Ring Cycle using Captain Harlock and the other Leiji Matsumoto characters to try get young audiences into opera. Hell, if Princess Tutu could get anime fans into classical ballet, this should be easy. As Bubsy the Bobcat would say ""What could possibly go wrong?"".Plot:An evil being called Alberich has stolen the Rhinegold from a planet at the center of the universe and has forged a ring of power to try conquer the universe. Harlock and his crew...end up meeting Alberich\'s sister Mime, who helps them on their quest to defeat Alberich and save the universe. Yeah...they made Mime a chick for some reason and decided to make Mime a hero. Why? Mime was written to be absolutely loathsome so the audience applauds when Siegfried stabs him to death! Oops...spoilers if you haven\'t seen the opera yet. Also the final villain of the Ring Cycle isn\'t Alberich, but rather his son Hagen. This anime doesn\'t even have Hagen in it...or Siegfried...or Brunhilde. When they say loose adaptation they mean VERY loose. Why even say its an adaptation if they are going to be this far from the source material? All this will do is piss off anyone who has seen the 4 operas or anyone who knows anything about opera. Oh, and the worst part is that this whole anime was made as a fun way to get people into opera, but it\'s actually WAY more boring than the operas it was based on. Seriously, this anime is a LONG 3 hours filled with scenes of nothing happening.Art:This does look a lot like the Harlock series from the 1970s in terms of art and animation quality so that\'s good. Unfortunately, this was made in 1999.Music:So this has an all Wagner soundtrack right? Nope! Each episode has maybe 2 minutes of Wagner and mostly consists of mediocre tracks from Kaoru Wada. Now look, I love the Inuyasha soundtrack and I\'ll always have a soft spot for Wada, but this is a fucking Wagner appreciation anime!!! An average episode of Galactic Heroes features more Wagner than Harlock Saga.Overall:This was an ambitious project that SHOULD have been great. Harlock is awesome. Wagner is awesome. The Ring Cycle is a great story that helped influence Tolkien  to create Lord of the Rings. All the pieces were there, but some head scratching terrible decisions derailed this project. How can this anime be summed up in just one word? Boring. I\'m really sad I have to say it, but this film for me and honestly for most people is incredibly dull. end up meeting Alberich\'s sister Mime, who helps them on their quest to defeat Alberich and save the universe.

Arashi no Yoru ni: Himitsu no Tomodachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13029/Arashi_no_Yoru_ni__Himitsu_no_Tomodachi,"['I still start by saying that it is impossible for me to give a completely unbiased review of this series, given my efforts in the English dub of the original movie that preceded the series.""Arashi no Yoru ni: Himitsu no Tomodachi"" is another realisation of the story based on the original series of childrens books written over fifteen years ago now.  The story is basic enough: A goat and a wolf befriend each other whilst taking shelter from a storm, and due to the dark environment and lack of ability to smell each other, they resort to having a conversation that sees them discover...they have a lot in common.  They only discover their differences in species when they meet again the following day, but the choose to pursue their friendship rather than let base instinct get the better of them.Where the series differs from the books and the movie is that Mei, who was originally cast as male in the movie and always seen as male by the author of the books, has now become May, a female goat.  This was probably done for marketing purposes to appeal to a larger audience, as well as to quash the more homoerotic undertones that the original story suffered from (through no fault of the story or movie itself, morseco thanks to the attention it received from people who wished to see such in the story, most notably in the furry fandom.)  I find this a disappointing change, as it actually leaves the interpretation of May and Gabu\'s relationship as being more a romance than a friendship, particularly in the way some episodes depict interaction between the two.The visuals are bright, cheery, and appealing to younger audiences; all the characters have a very neotenic style, especially the goats, though even Ghiro looks quite tame compared to his movie counterpart.  The backgrounds are beautifully rendered, but the animation at times can be stilted, the goats\' anatomy lookng downright weird at times.The series is also clearly aimed at a much younger audience, with the English dialogue very slow and simplified, likely to assist with youngsters wishing to learn English.  Whilst the voices are acceptable, it lacks the flow and greater expression of the Japanese dub, even though the animation is tailored to synchronise with the English dub.  The soundtrack also re-uses substantial amounts of the orchestral soundtrack written for the original movie, with other incidental music sounding much cheaper for the rest of the time.The series, running at 26 episodes, only covers the original story up to about book 4 of the original 7-book series, and re-writes certain scenes from both the books and the movies, using elements of the later books but in reference to other characters.  Why this was done is unclear, as the current series has an extremely open ending and feel incomplete as it stands, with no resolution to the actions of certain characters.  Whether or not this indicates there will be a second season of the show is unknown, but as it stands the conclusion to the series is quite unsatisfying in its attempt to wrap things up.Overall, I give it a 6 out of 10.  It has its heartwarming moments, and the story is still touching, but it is lacking in a great many ways compared to the original story books and movie adaptation. they have a lot in common.

Since I'm an anime fan, I immediately searched the movie on here and found out it had a tv adaptation. After enjoying the movie version quite a bit, I was wanting to check out the TV series. However, after reading a review saying it was incomplete, I was hesitant. Anime is notorious for leaving open ended endings, some will still leave you with a wholesome feeling towards the end while others will leave a gaping hole that might keep you up at night and regretful...you ever tried. I don't like the push to manga as I don't read manga, period.Anyhow, after much debate, I decided to give it a try. A previous review said how the series lack in many ways to the movie but I kind of enjoyed this tv series more than the movie. While the movie did give this show a conclusion, the tv series had the luxury to give you time to let it soak in. The bond between the characters and relationship that formed had more time and room to grow and shape itself. I'm also glad to say that, though the anime ended a bit prematurely, it did cover the main parts of the show and the ending was not so bad, though I was saddened it didn't continue for another 12 episodes or so.The voice acting for this anime was perfect for me. The two main characters had adorable voices that fit them very well.I also very much adored the CG animation. Their CG wasn't great in details, but their facial and body movements were very energetic, full of life, charismatic, and on point for me. It was one of the main reasons that made me fall in love with this, everything just fits. Perfect? No way, but the most important stuff I think they got it right.This is a real feel good anime, it brought a smile to my face and I really needed one. Even though the anime was aimed at kids, as an adult, I appreciate the message that it was showing and there were some conflicts that show that deep down it had a more complex and thoughtful plot and message. I would definitely recommend anyone that liked the movie to watch. Sad that there weren't more episodes, but happy that it didn't get milked to the point where I hated it. you ever tried.

There's no real plot no real story just a bunch of silly fan service scenes.Unfortunately the art isn't as good the main series. It's taken a definite downturn in quality. The backgrounds seem more computer generated or just had less effort put into them. The characters were definitely not as well drawn or animated, a real disappointment...when so much of this was fan service.Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an English dub of these ova, so I can't comment on the voice acting.  The music is about on the same level as the original series if not a little better.TL:DR If you made it this far through these you'll probably enjoy these. when so much of this was fan service.Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an English dub of these ova, so I can't comment on the voice acting.

It was worst than the actual anime to be honest its like the hiked how pathetic he was before up another 3 notches and went with that while the...girls did the same.

Hina Logi: From Luck & Logic,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34834/Hina_Logi__From_Luck___Logic,"[""Fun, Cuteness, and Charming Character Interactions: the goal of a good CGDCT. And for that Hina Logi is a great show. For it has all 3 of those in spades.Hina Logi feels like another show in the growing trend of CGDCT borrowing from Western Cartoons. Some of the tropes featured are those that are straight out of cartoon plots, and with an implementation that seems very in line with what happens in cartoons. For example, the last episode was a cartoon plot that I had seen very many times before, and it worked in the fashion that I usually expect them too. It did have...a couple of differences, but that's what makes it work so well. If one were to just copy Western Animation and add nothing more, it would just be a pretty version of a mediocre cartoon. But the ability for Hina Logi to take that, and take the good parts of those tropes and its humor and combine it with the cuteness and fluffy fun of CGDCT is what makes it so much fun to watch.Another example of its cartoon influence are the scenes that revolve around her dad. Lion's animosity towards her overprotective and overloving dad and his unrivalled enthusiasm is much like what I expect from cartoons. Especially with the outlandish ways, her dad acts. While he doesn't fall into the idiot dad trope (he's very competent, just very loving and very silly), he lands closer to cartoon's approach to parents rather than the more grounded and reserved style that anime parents are usually put into (when they even appear.). And that isn't to say that anime parents being eccentric doesn't happen, it's rather the way that he is seems more cartoon-like than other anime examples. The coloration of his interactions with Lion and the cast and the humor involved in his actions do add an extra element of fun to the show. It sets it apart from other CGDCT shows and makes it unique which is much appreciated.Doga Kobo has done many CGDCT shows before and if one has watched one of those it's easy to see that Dogo Kobo knows what it's doing with cuteness. However Hina Logi adds to that even more with the adorable expressiveness of Lion, as well as the silly antics that the group gets into. The show is a lot more animated and a lot farther from realism. Comedy gags will be used heavily. Character's actions will be embellished for the sake of silliness. While it might not be for everyone it does enhance the cuteness of the show for me. While comfy is nice it doesn't fully ascent the cuteness like the more energetic CGDCT shows can. Hina Logi falls into that more energetic group and for those that like that, like myself, it makes for a really good choice.The character interactions are all great as well. The characters have natural chemistry with each other and it's very believable that they are all friends and good ones at that. They care for each other and try to help each other. They bond with each other and all of that. Each interaction feels very real and doesn't' have those hints of fakeness that some shows are plagued by. And while other shows will have similar character interactions like these, there was something special about them. Something that made me happy inside each time I watched them hang out with each other. It's not as if they were relatable or the best-written characters. They just had this shining aura to them. It also doesn't hurt that in the latter half of the series they amp up the gayness to 11. Now I'm personally not the type of person who is happy just because yuri is present but seeing the already existing adorable and meaningful bonds between the characters bloom into something more was so wonderful for my heart. It didn't feel just like pairing them up for the sake of pairing, but rather a good couple that fit together well and would make for a happy life together.While the characters weren't the most developed they also weren't one-note characters. While one shouldn't go into this series excepting stellar character development, they stiill were given ample room to grow and did have moments where they shined and their characterization got built up. There is a key moment for Nina and Lion later on in the series, as well as lighter moments for each of the main characters. The episodes themselves work decently well and thusly does allow them to be that less shallow. They're decent characters who are able to shine with the natural chemistry that they have with each other. And because of the fun. This show is a whole lot of fun.One interesting appeal to Hina Logi is the trance and action scenes that comes with being from Luck & Logic. The action scenes were pretty good when they happened although they didn't show up that much. It can add an extra layer of appeal and certainly it's nice to see some good action mixed between episodes. In some episodes, it's used really well to build up the plot or resonate with character issues. As well the outfits from the trances do add some nice eye candy as well as show interesting and unique costumes that enhance the cuteness and provide a nice set of attire that often isn't as utilized. I think the trancing is blended in really well with the show as a whole and does help its narrative and its uniqueness.One small complaint I have about the show is the pacing can be too rushed at times. The SOL episodes have a great pace to them and flow naturally due to them not being from a 4koma. But, in the more important episodes, it has a tendency to try to jam in too much material into one episode. While I did enjoy all of what each episode had to say. I do wish it could have taken more time to fully flesh out some of those emotions or ideas. Also while overall the art is good, later into the season it sometimes cheaped out likely due to delays. Something that I hope can be fixed in the Blue-rays. However, these issues to me are small compared to the good that it has in it.In the end, while I do want to give props for the good things that Hina Logi has done, it's really a simple gay show that mainly relies on cute comedic moments but works so well. It has everything that I want from a CGDCT, and for me, that's a show well worth watching. It may not have the layers and deep meaning of K-On! or all of the great details and character building that Urara Meirochou has. But it's fun, cute, and heartwarming.

Considering that only 6k people watched the anime and its a mahou shoujo Cute girls doing cute things(CGDCT) which are quite unpopular and underrated on mal the score is actually quite good. Imagine a more popular CGDCT anime like New game or GochiUsa having HinaLogi's popularity i bet the score would be about the same.Anyway dont look at Hinalogi's score to determine if the anime is good, look more at the popularity.So what is HinaLogi? from the original Luck and Logic...which is based on card game, do you need to watch the original for Hinalogi? Absolutely not, its a standalone anime not a sequel.HinaLogi is sliceoflifeish lighthearted mahou shoujo which is just pure enjoyment. I started liking the anime ever since 1st episode and not a single time ever since i felt anything but a pure enjoyment. And what's more important than being enjoyed in the CDCGT anime.Whats important to be a very good CDCGT anime? Being really enjoyable and fun. Having really great,charming characters and lots of great interactions. 3) And it being really cute. And HinaLogi is really great at all that. On top of that we have a pretty nice story, even if it wasnt story-oriented anime, we had quite a nice story regardless. And Character development which we also had. Also also HinaLogi has a great world and some nice battles and great transformation scenes (hence its a mahou shoujo) Characters are Logicalists who are able to transform and get powers from Foreigners who are beings from a different dimension. Interesting right?Whether you are a Mahou shoujo fan or CGDCT fan the anime should satisfy you greatly. And wow if you actually like some light Yuri action you will most definitely like Hinalogi. We even had a kiss wowwowowI know i mentioned characters being great earlier but i cant stress enough just how great they are T_T all of them. Wasnt a single character which i hated or which ruined the anime for me. All of the girls are so lovable. and there is only ONE MALE character who is father of our main heroine. Who is absolutely HILARIOUS. I've never seen a better father before, not only is he really caring but he is unbelievably hilarious. He is russian so he sometimes throw some Russian lines which are unbelievably hilarious to hear.3 main girls and their interactions are especially the best part of the anime for me, all of them are obvious waifu materials, all of them have really great different expressions that are screenshot worthy.Lastly the OP and ED are just crazy good, in total i listened to them 800 times or so? just super catchy. which is based on card game, do you need to watch the original for Hinalogi?

Some persons could have been waiting for a continuation of Luck and Logi, but this show is different. At first, I was one of those people, but then I realized that this show was more a slice of life between a group of girls and their experiences.Giving an appropriate score based on the story will be a mistake, Perhaps the story has only one relationship with the other series and is the Logicalist and ALCA. The only way to connect this group...of girls to it is creating a small story with Nina and her constant desire to return to ALCA. From the other hand, we have Lioness that needs to learn a bit more about her trance control.The story could be a spin-off from Luck & Logic. It isn\'t required to watch it, and there isn\'t any ""Luck"" and ""Logi"" around. In summary, the story is about Logicalist and girls that are able of doing ""trance"" with them. These girls are in a school that gives them courses to control and improve their trances. In some part of the road, the story deviated from the real path and ended showing a slice of life of these girls, their joys, sadness, family, festivals, dreams, etc. The story isn\'t bad, but do not expect constant fights and other stuff,What impressed me was the Opening. I must say that the art team worked very hard in that mix using stop motion, superposition, and other techniques to make a very fluid opening, combined with the song ""Butterfly Effector"" created a very delightful opening from the artistic side.The characters: Some of them have an attractive personality, for example, I liked Nina and her constant desire of returning to ALCA and Lion with her friendship with all them but especially Nina. Call it cliche, but sometimes these stories could be very similar to others around, but the slice of life shows us some new perspectives from characters to characters.About the art, it has a very bright palette as expected from this kind of animation and centers in the details of the drawings to resemble the cutest part of them.The sound, as I said, the OP is good. The ED is an average song, and the audio mix is acceptable.Finally, I don\'t consider this animation wrong from the art and design it is good.

Before I start, I want to point out that this show is a very different animal from the previous show in this franchise, ""Luck & Logic"". So if you ignored this show because you didn\'t like that one, you might want to reconsider.Story - I believe this show qualifies as a ""Cute Girls Doing Cute Things"" show. There are a few plot points, but for the most part, we are just watching the relationships of the characters develop through...their interactions. There is also some action in there every now and then to spice things up. Overall, I felt satisfied, and I loved how it ended.Art - Other than the occasional hiccup in the action scenes, the animation in this show is solid. You could even argue it\'s better than it needs to be for a show like this, but I appreciated every bit of it. I thought the scenery was also great, but I am a bit biased for shows that take place in beautiful and squeaky clean school campuses. The fanservice comes in the form of revealing transformation outfits, the occasional bath scene, and a few nice surprises.Sound - The soundtrack tends to use the same songs over and over, but somehow I never got sick of them! I also thought the voice acting was great, especially Yayoi who really nails the Oujo-sama type character.Character - As you might imagine, most of the characters are cute girls. I am usually picky when it comes to characters, but in this show I loved them all. Lion is an honest cheerful girl and Nina is a loner that keeps everyone at a distance. Watching Nina\'s character develop because of Lion is definitely one of the highlights of the show. The interactions between them and the rest of the characters (Like Yayoi, the Oujo-sama I mentioned before, and Mahiro, a crazy science girl type character.) provided a very nice blend of characters to create comedy that appealed to me.Enjoyment - I looked forward to watching this show every week. It delivered comedy, fanservice, and even some drama, with its lovable characters. I liked it right from the beginning, so I think watching just one episode should give you enough of an idea to decide weather you will like it. Therefore, if it sounds like something you may like, you may want to give it a try. their interactions. There is also some action in there every now and then to spice things up.

The characters have there own distinct personalities which is nice but basically are the same cookie cutter characters. The opening and ending sound really good but are pretty generic and unmemorable. The art is cute and sparkly like a lot of magical girl anime (also nothing new).

Such genres don\'t need character development or story to make it work, all it needs to do is create endearing characters and put them through daily activities, the key here is the character interaction....Then why does this Anime try to shove a half-done story down our throats? In a genre where the story isn\'t important at all, where the show can\'t build a complex story simply because if they tried then the ""cute"" part of the genre wouldn\'t work out and yet they still tried to make a ""story"" and to have ""emotions"" and such things. Character interaction is what creates cuteness and the happy atmosphere that shows such as this go for, when they add serious emotions to the formula what you get is a half-done interaction that can\'t yield happy atmosphere or serious emotions within the viewer.This genre doesn\'t need deep characters and emotions, but they tried to have a go at it, they made characters with problems and emotional interactions but it fails, what they tried to do and what they were aiming at doesn\'t match.The problem is the overall theme and the genre they were going for, they tried making parts of the show match with the genre and  left few parts that didn\'t worked out. A serious show can\'t have ""moe"" characters, it might seem funny for awhile but it will get bad fast, and as such a ""moe"" show can\'t have serious characters, it just goes bad.The overall art and sound was above average, the character designs were generic, they didn\'t stood out in a bad or good way.

That\'s what I like to say first to grab your attention. If you like cute anime girls that transform just like they do in mahou shoujo (magical girl) anime in a Slice of Life setting with a small pinch of Tournament Arc and you\'re familair with the anime diabetes from of Studio Doga Kobo, why not give Hina Logi: From Luck & Logic a chance?So what in tarnation is this Hina Logi: From Luck & Logic you might ask? It\'s actully a standalone spin-off of from the original Luck and Logic which is based on a card game...that also recieved an adaptation from Studio Doga Kobo. Doesn\'t sound very impressieve on paper, but in reality you really should not judge the book by it\'s cover. No, I haven\'t seen the original anime iether (yet?), but I can confirm it\'s not a requirement to watch this series. However, you will encounter previous characters from the father anime that were main characters from the father anime. It will however take over it\'s terms and plot elements from the father anime and it\'s really is noticeable that it\'s based of a card game I never heard of before, so if you aren\'t familiar with that, chances are you can get confused for at times. Atleast I was for a bit. But I can tell you it won\'t be a hinderance.Story 6/10 (Fine)The story begins with Liones Yelistratova that is a princess from a smaller country that goes to another country for attending a school. You know, typical Cute Anime Girls School stuff. This school however tries to maintain world peace by keeping Foreigners outside that have bad intentions or something along those lines and teaching cute anime girls to become Logicalists. Before you start frowning; this show is just another cute girls going to school type of anime, so the plot is very easy to follow anyway. It just uses some terms from the original anime so if you really want to care about the terms that get used, I\'d suggest to watch the father anime first. But it\'s not a requirement. Eventually it would make more sense further the more far you get into the show. Don\'t worry about it.Art-style: 7/10 (Good)The art-style is what you can expect from Studio Doga Kobo. For the tiny ammount of shows I\'ve seen so far I know already I won\'t get dissapointed easlily in Studio Doga Kobo\'s art-style. What I like about the art-style that they really did managed to sneak up Western cartoon-like gags you often see in Western cartoons. But it\'s done in a very amusing way. I like spotting these kind of details. Of course since this anime is magical themed, there will also be usage of CGI, which I\'m personally not very fond off. Another point would be the visuals in the during the bit out of place opening song while the visuals give you a Hidamari Sketch x South Park feeling that also felt not really suited for this show so  feel like I kinda have to take some points off for this in the long-run. I\'m not saying I don\'t like the song; it\'s just they could have picked something better even tough the song sounds nice as being seperate item.  But in the long run the art-style overall still remains positieve enough to be good enough.Sound: 7/10 (Good)The voice acting was done very well and suited the characters for sure. It\'s like you can hear the moe diabetes that\'s seeping trough your speakers entering your body. Especially when the voice actor Madoka Asahina speaks as Liones. She stands out as the best in the voice acting departement in this anime for sure that I have to mention it. The OST itself also suited for the kind of show you\'re watching. The opening song titled ""BUTTERFLY EFFECTOR"" by the Japanese singer TREU (also know as Miho Karasawa that appearantly appears in several other anime opening and ending songs) feels a bit out of place together with it\'s visuals for the type of show it is (no, I\'m not saying I don\'t like the song), but the ending song plus visuals make up for it. Either way, I don\'t have any big complains for the sound department!Character: 7/10 (Good)The characters in this anime are very adorable in their own way. Yes, they do contain all the very populair anime girl personallities that you normally can expect, but they are not overly done, so it\'s not a hinderance.. Personally my favorite of this show would be Nina Alexandrovna. There\'s something about her that really stands out in this show for me compaired with the other charathers. Maybe it\'s becayse she\'s the quiet, cute and a tiny bit of tsundere. Maybe it\'s just because off the ribbons in her hair. Maybe it\'s because she looks tired and/or high all the time. You\'d be the judge. Fans of anime girls with a moe fang would enjoy Mahiro Kyoubashi for instance which would be my second favorite charather of the show, because they have added a fun gag with Mahiro as well. Since this anime is almost 100% female based, I think it\'s worth mentioning the only male role of this show aswell. That would be Liones over protective father named Lion no Otousan. He may be a bit over protective just perhaps for comedic relief, but still very like-able as a side charather.Enjoyment: 8/10 (Very Good)In overall, this anime sure isn\'t populair and doesn\'t get much attention, but is still worth mentioning so other people know about it\'s existense. What I enjoyed the most are all the small details they have added into this anime. The dialogues are sometimes the same kind of subjects I\'d love to discuss with people. Who knew there\'s a star system \'only 25 lightyears\' away from us called Vega appearantly. Did you knew that? No I didn\'t. Yet, they have added this as a minor detail in the dialogue just as an example.Overall: 7/10 (Good)Surprising, I enjoyed this show much more than I was thinking I would. Who doesn\'t like watching cute magical anime girls doing cute things that can transform using cards can be fun? I know from myself I\'m not very home into \'magical girls anime\' besides some Sailor Moon back when I was a kid in the \'90\'s and the recent darker Mahou Shoujo anime that recently aired like \'Mahou Shoujo Site\' to take as an example. This anime sure is very feminine for sure, but I still enjoyed it a lot. Oh, and can I mention the yuri bait in this anime is also very debatable? Yes, we do get to see a bit of yuri bait every now and then if you put it out of context, but in reality the bonding between the girls is very adorable that you will get moe diabetes if you haven\'t gotten moe diabetes already. This anime sure was enjoyable with all it\'s shenanigans. To summ up, this is a very fun Mahou Shoujo anime with Cute Girls Doing Magical Things imbredded with a Slice of Lie School theme and a very tiny bit of Tournament Arc that everyone should give atleast a chance if you\'re in for that. I\'d like to give this adorable anime a well earned 7 out of 10! that also recieved an adaptation from Studio Doga Kobo. Doesn\'t sound very impressieve on paper, but in reality you really should not judge the book by it\'s cover.

He may be a bit over protective just perhaps for comedic relief, but still very like-able as a side charather.Enjoyment: 8/10 (Very Good)In overall, this anime sure isn\'t populair and doesn\'t get much attention, but is still worth mentioning so other people know about it\'s existense. What I enjoyed the most are all the small details they have added into this anime. The dialogues are sometimes the same kind of subjects I\'d love to discuss with people. Who knew there\'s a star system \'only 25 lightyears\' away from us called Vega appearantly. Did you knew that? No I didn\'t. Yet, they have added this as a minor detail in the dialogue just as an example.Overall: 7/10 (Good)Surprising, I enjoyed this show much more than I was thinking I would. Who doesn\'t like watching cute magical anime girls doing cute things that can transform using cards can be fun? I know from myself I\'m not very home into \'magical girls anime\' besides some Sailor Moon back when I was a kid in the \'90\'s and the recent darker Mahou Shoujo anime that recently aired like \'Mahou Shoujo Site\' to take as an example. This anime sure is very feminine for sure, but I still enjoyed it a lot. Oh, and can I mention the yuri bait in this anime is also very debatable? Yes, we do get to see a bit of yuri bait every now and then if you put it out of context, but in reality the bonding between the girls is very adorable that you will get moe diabetes if you haven\'t gotten moe diabetes already. This anime sure was enjoyable with all it\'s shenanigans. To summ up, this is a very fun Mahou Shoujo anime with Cute Girls Doing Magical Things imbredded with a Slice of Lie School theme and a very tiny bit of Tournament Arc that everyone should give atleast a chance if you\'re in for that. I\'d like to give this adorable anime a well earned 7 out of 10!', ""I'm posting this review in the hopes that more people will check out this show.This is a severely underwatched & underrated CGDCT disguised as a fantasy action due to it being derived from its parent series that I didn't happen to watch, which is more action oriented rather than slice of life like this one. But this does have a good amount of action, don't get me wrong.Like others have said, you do not need to have watched the main series to enjoy this for its cute heartwarming epicness.The story in this show is decent, but nothing incredible that will have you deeply guessing some...sort of intense plot. Due to the nature of this show focusing more on a few girls' lives at an academy for Logicalists (basically girls who can transform 'mahou-shoujo style'), it is more slice of life than deeply plot focused. I found the first half of the season to be more comedy-focused with things like Lion's dad showing up, while the second half was more emotionally driven and focused more on the friendships/ relationships developments between the girls. I liked both aspects, but I believe that the second half was better in this series. 7/10 for Story.The art is awesome. Doga Kobo as always nails it when it comes to the cute girls SoL genre. Colors are ultra vivid, the girls are beautiful and mesmerizing, and the action sequences are a cut or multiple above a typical SoL. The surroundings were not the focus here so much, most of the focus is on the characters themselves (which isn't a bad thing), not atypical of a doga kobo series from what I've seen in the past. 10/10 for art.Sound was totally fine. The soundtracks were fitting and fun, the voice acting fit for the characters, and there wasn't much of anything to complain about. I'm personally not a big fan of furry little creatures making the same noise for the duration of an entire show, so 1 point deducted for Belle. 9/10Characters... there were 4 that I found great, being Nina, Mahiro, Yayoi, and Lion. I won't get too deep into why I found them great, because I don't want to spoil the important bits, but I'll say that Yayoi and Mahiro especially were great because it felt like they broke the typical archetype formula a bit and were pretty unique, more so Yayoi.Also, if you like some yuri bait in these shows, there is definitely some of that here, and in one particular episode it goes above and beyond the typical bait formula and takes it almost to the next level.. almost! 9/10 for character.I enjoyed the heck out of this show more than I thought I would and would recommend it to any fan of the cute moe slice of life fan. The show tries to take itself a bit more seriously than the average moe show due to its parent story so you'll have a bit less facial expression 'intensities' than the typical stuff out there, and I don't remember many chibi moments (if there were any at all), but it doesn't fail to deliver in the cute department whatsoever. 10/10 for enjoyment.It would be great to have another season for this one but I doubt it since the manga is finished as far as I know. However, it's highly worth checking out if you like this genre and you won't be disappointed if you come in with realistic expectations. You may even be surprised at how much you like it, like I did.9/10 ! sort of intense plot.

Like there wasn't really anything I really liked about it. Maybe the character designs I think all the characters all look very interesting but other than that this was overall pretty mid. The story was pretty meh like it wasn't really bad for what it was just didn't really do a whole lot to make the series better. For art like I said I thought the characters looked pretty cool so that's a pretty big positive, I like the like other world transformation outfits or whatever those look...cool. The sound was memorable I thought the music and stuff were pretty decent so there's that. The characters weren't anything special but they weren't really bad either they were just kinda alright. In terms of me liking this id give it like a 5. It was pretty enjoyable its just kinda forgettable and didn't really offer anything to make it go higher. Overall quality id say like a 4, like I said before I just feel it really needed something more to make it good in terms of quality id say it's more like a 4 maybe like high 4 like a 4.5 but yeah that's about it. cool.

Maybe it\'s just a show of where my tastes in anime have gone after 3 years of watching pretty much non-stop. Eventually you embrace the moe, because the moe is familiar, and it can\'t disappoint you.So yeah I liked this show, it\'s got a great bunch of girls who are all stupid in their own charming ways and no forced drama or heavy-handed metaphors about mankind being the real monsters. Just comfy, heart-warming tales of youth and school time mischief. It\'s almost enough...to make you forget the disaster that was the Luck & Logic anime.8/10 to make you forget the disaster that was the Luck & Logic anime.8/10', ""I watched Luck and Logic (partially) and its spinoff Hina Logi ~from Luck and Logic~. Both of these shows were made by Doga Kobo. Thoughts on both series are provided below.Luck and Logic:The female hero characters are somewhat likable and showed some potential for an interesting character-driven story. The main male character is a generic personality-less MC.Nice transformation scenes.Episodes are mainly monster-of-the-week conflicts which are boring as hell.I dropped this after episode 6....Some of the female hero characters seemed interesting but truly this show is trash with few redeeming qualities.Hina Logi:- Surprisingly enjoyable- Likable and cute characters- Nice mahou shoujo outfits- CUTE!!!!!!Mostly episodic in terms of plot. Fairly typical school SoL plots but with a mahou shoujo flavour. There was a healthy mix of comfy SoL, sweet moments, and some minor drama. There were some mild shoujo-ai vibes between the two lead characters, but it was only a subtle aspect of the show until THAT ONE SCENE (*squees internally*).Decent voice acting and the OST was okay as well.Hina Logi was overlooked by many due to it being a spinoff (in name at least) from the show Luck and Logic. Consequently, very few people watched it despite it being a decent CGDCT show. Furthermore, it is underrated as a result of a selection-bias effect whereby those who did watch the show were typically those who enjoyed the garbage original series. The two shows are completely different and the kind of person who would enjoy one is unlikely to enjoy the other. Anyway, my point is that Hina Logi is a show which is very much underappreciated by those who are fans of CGDCT anime.Aside from some character cameos from the original series, this show is almost entirely independent from the Luck and Logic anime. It takes place in the same world, although the tone is completely different. The atmosphere in Hina Logi is very soft and playful with minimal conflict. The main girl characters are in training at an academy to be the same kinds of heroes that are depicted in the original series. You do not need to watch Luck and Logic to watch Hina Logi. The plot dependencies and crossovers are very insignificant between the series.My rating for Hina Logi: 7/10It's a good CGDCT show that barely anybody watched.

Attacker You!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3081/Attacker_You,"['This is a really old anime! The history is about You Hazuki, a girl who begins to love volleyball (and not just volleyball :P), and plays in the school team. Day after day she grows older and more mature, she learns a lot about herself, makes friends... I find it a lot similiar to Captain Tsubasa.Anyway, I remember that when I first saw the anime (I was maybe 11) it was really exciting... I began to like volleyball because of it.xEsse é um anime muito antigo mesmo! A história gira em volta da personagem principal, You Hazuki, que é apaixonada pelo vôlei e...joga no time da escola. Durante o anime ela vai crescendo e ganhando habilidades, fazendo amigos e tal... eu acho a história bem parecida com Captain Tsubasa. De qualquer forma achei esse anime bem empolgante, nos episódios em que a You treinava para conseguir saltar mais alto, eu treinava junto com ela em casa rsrs... vale a pena dar uma olhada no anime :) joga no time da escola.

To this day I wonder: the fact that it has been proposed again and again for a decade without rest ... could it not be the only reason that pushes many of us to think about it with nostalgic pleasure? It is true, ""Attacker You!"", The original title of the work, has in itself a teaching that at least the majority of parents...has always tried to inculcate to their children, that is the good old ""if you put yourself with all of yourself, you will be able ""; but in my opinion this alone does not define a good animation work. In order to speak of a good job, the following characteristics must be able to be attributed to it, at least at a certain level: good drawings and animation for the historical period in which it was created; an original and well-developed storyline, the respect of the pact with the public (so the premises must be taken into consideration at every moment without making glorious slips in the plot or by half-closing doors that are then neither opened nor used nor closed in some way, but rather they remain so without any use except to fill or distract; well characterized characters (major or secondary characters: if they come into play they must do it properly); the recycling of drawings should be non-existent, but I realize that for the Japanese animators of the period it was an unimaginably expensive thing etc .; contents, developments and plausible implications according to the premises and the cardboard genre.Mila and Shiro - Two hearts in volleyball ... those who do not know this anime have not fully lived their childhood. Every day she was on television when I was a kid, and every time I stood in front of the screen; surely it is an anime that has accompanied me for some time along the growth, but seeing it again and reviewing it now has a completely different effect.The visual sector weighs heavily on the series, but, given those years, you can\'t expect more; the drawings are not bad, but the animations are scarce also because of the recycles, which are very visible during the games. The sound sector is normal, with good sound effects; the Italian abbreviation is pleasant and dubbing convinces.The development of the plot is simple, linear and even a little obvious, but on the whole it is very pleasant and engaging. The characters, however, are not very characterized, except for the protagonist who seems to be the only charismatic and full of many positive aspects. What entertains the soul is how the protagonist impacts the story in a fantastic way, giving many emotions and reflective moments; volleyball games are the main attractions, and the main character will show all its positive aspects, game after game, also demonstrating important values \u200b\u200bsuch as friendship and love, and the value of the family outside the field.In conclusion, this anime deserves a vision anyway, given the values \u200b\u200bput into play by the protagonist, who are still excellent qualities to show even to a minor audience. has always tried to inculcate to their children, that is the good old ""if you put yourself with all of yourself, you will be able ""; but in my opinion this alone does not define a good animation work.

At the time i wasn\'t a big fan of this. To be frank, my sister loved it, and that may be half the reason why i craped on it so hard ^^\'.The interesting part is that i really started to like this when i first rewatched it in 2010... What is interesting about this you may ask? Well, it is the fact that this anime is almost as old as me, and there are old animes that make my eyes bleed. What is old is not always like good wine... it doesn\'t necessarily age...well. I tried to rewatch ""Captain Tsubasa"", but it is beyond me... Much easier with ""Attacker You"".Story: 8/10The story may be the best part of this anime. There is one reason why i rate it highly. It was made before all the sports animes stereotypes came to rule japanese animation and drilled into our skull that sports in anime have to be about the Inter High and school. Seriously, how many series did you watch that is just like that?- MC is a wimp, a blank carpet. The poor sod has no more purpose in life than your average toilet scrub. Fortunately, he/she will find his/her purpose in life through an awe-inspiring senpai that can make taking a shit look so damn cool. Hence, MC will get addicted to *insert any sport* for it provides sense to him being a toilet scrub, and MC will want to become the senpai (not \'like\' the senpai, but become the senpai, literally. Talk about bad-ass psychosis).- The new life goal of our MC, aside from becoming his senpai, is to win the inter-high. It is because it is well known that once you graduate and enter a work life, your very existence will be about spending your life at work, doing nothing but looking good. Hence, you only have time to dream in High School.- The MC will have plenty of creepy lines about his love for the sports and his nakamas, and how he would sell his dog and grandma to slavers in Roanapur for the sake of going to the inter High with his senpai (all his senpai this time, this is where it becomes ever more creepy). This is the moment i watch with muted sound, personally.- 100% of the story the author will tell us is set in High School. The summer of the 3rd year sounds like the moment the main cast\'s death penalty will be enforced.As of now, i only found 2 sports animes that break this mold (i have watched A LOT of those), and be it as it may, these 2 are my 2 all time favorites in the genre:- ""Baby Steps"" (9/10)- ""Attacker You"" (8/10)Because obviously, sports is life too, like work or hobbies are. ""Baby Steps"" is about Eiichiro trying to become a pro tennis player, and ""Attacker You"" is basically the same, with Volley-Ball. Having a passion, the sport, becoming a life project simply feels natural, and i can\'t say enough how these Inter High sports animes feel narrow-minded to me. I wish all sports anime took example on ""Attacker You"". You (the MC, not U, gullible narcissist :)) will still meet the senpai Hayase, but all the relationships in the anime are at odds with modern standards. Her senpai hates her for she is the senpai due to her longer experience. The coach, Daimon, is violent and abusive. It is spartan, yes, which is a 80\'s trend, too, but you won\'t make your diabet worse by simply watching. No excess sugar to be expected.Characters: 6I hardly ever go above 7 in this area. If i do, this means i found some genuinely great work. You is stereotyped in that she is a hard worker and live for her purpose, but she is not so obsessive as to forget everything else. She is not the oblivious type of character that won\'t understand anything. Her character is motivated by more than the mere sports, and the stakes of her life story go beyond Volley Ball. Her overly passionate behavior is not a mere steretoype, it is a plot device that contributes to deepen both herself and the cast surrounding her.Other characters are what you would expect, but they are always more than the stereotype they may seem to be at first. It is not deep enough to find oil, but deep enough for a sports anime. Actually, the characters in ""Attacker You"" may be the best out of all the sports animes i have watched. Her father and brother, Nami, Eri, everyone in the cast has something to offer.Art: 4This was decent for the early 80\'s. But it was never remastered as far as i know... Expect some 4/3 blurry screens with sad excuses for backgrounds, reused animations and all that. Aside from that, the animation quality itself is very decent even to this days standards, and aside from the low resolution due to the age, the drawings are fine, too. In short, expect low resolution screens with simple screen composition and decent, if reused, animation. Most younger people will probably dismiss everything as crap, but i like to be thorough. Not everything is crap. Personally i don\'t mind the old visuals.Sound: 4Basically the same as with the visuals. Many sound effects are very 80\'s (remember this when you hear the ball being hit ^^)... The series was not remastered and thus, the sound is like if recorded on an old audio cassette. Dang, audio cassettes were high tech at the time. But i personally like the VA. The trend for VA was different. It emphasized a more natural feel. Nowadays, it became a true art to add all sorts of gulps, sigh, peculiar tones and such. I like it, too. But i am unsure if one if stricly superior to the other. Still, expect for the sound to give you some genuine 80\'s vibes.Enjoyment: 9You (The MC, not U, dang...) learns about the sports, struggles with her life, decides what she wants for herself and then vyies for it with everything she has. While it may sound stereotyped, it is not that much, as explained above. It is about a life project, and to me, it makes all the difference.Overall: 8Maybe the 80\'s was a time when Japanese weren\'t that afraid of conflicts yet, and could conceive series where conflicts are a natural part of life. This i can relate with. But that is certainly not the case anymore, which is a source of endless frustrations to me, as i watch anime characters unable to voice anything and authors build all their stories by exploiting the resulting misunderstandings. Stories that could be solved episode 1 if only 2 characters just sat down and talked........ I learned last year that using pronouns like ""anata"" or ""omae"" sounded rude and thus are hardly used, and that japanese will hardly ever speak a sentence in its entirety, letting others guess what they mean... Times change. But not always for the best. All the more reason to look behind at times, and to try out old animes like this one. well. I tried to rewatch ""Captain Tsubasa"", but it is beyond me...

Condom Battler Gorou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42220/Condom_Battler_Gorou,"[""Idk what you want me to say. It's a pretty damn good parody of shounen anime.Yu Gi Oh, Pokemon, DBZ, somehow also Yu Yu Hakusho, One Piece and Beyblade too, condensed into this one educational short of condoms, when to use them, how to use them, and why you should use them.Honestly, I was so close to writing something shitpost-y, but this is ridiculously good relative to how much it can fit in its minuscule timeframe that it isn't even funny. To do it so well too is something else. But I suppose that is just the nature of fast-paced works. "", 'They are a series of advertisements to advertise condoms from the Okamoto Condoms company. The ""series"" consists of 4 episodes, which parody anime such as Dragon Ball and Yu-Gi-Oh, the protagonist for example has a design that goes to recall that of Ash Ketchum and Goku. The episodes are then recaps of a fictional action series, and the episodes are nicknamed with the scattered episode number (the first, nineteenth, forty-fifth and fifty-sixth). The series, in addition to advertising condoms, seeks to teach the masses the use of condoms.A truly unusual and successful advertisement, fun and well written. And being truly original as a marketing gimmick,...the vote I give it as an advertisement is 10 the vote I give it as an advertisement is 10', 'This gave me the sex-ed i didn\'t get in school, and not only that, but it taught me more than any school subject or book ever could. Easily one of the most educational pieces of media that I\'ve ever had the pleasure of laying my eyes upon. The sudden and magnificent plot twists had me clutching my pearl necklace while watching!! The characters were all amazingly portrayed, their actions being metaphors for various philosophical issues we all end up facing in real life, such as: ""should I use 2 condoms at once just to be safe?!"", and the trials and tribulations of parenting. Truly the...definition of a masterpiece. definition of a masterpiece.']"
Cardfight!! Vanguard: Shinemon-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40167/Cardfight_Vanguard__Shinemon-hen,"[""Cardfight !! Vanguard: Shinemon-hen now tells the story of the card capital manager but the thing is the same as the previous season if you already saw the first version it would be a waste of time to see it since there are some facts only the difference is that it changes some situations add others that considerably affect the plot since you don't know what to believe.In the case of the story, it is simple and has nothing remarkable, you only know Shinemon's past because of everything he had to go through to become what he is today (what we see in the anime)...with the inclusion of characters that at the end of accounts end up discarded and without importance in the story you only know that they are there but nothing more.While with the development of the characters in my case it seemed a little better and more because it takes you to know the story of misaki but in a slightly more serious and a little better written of the others it is known throughout of the anime (but in the same way without highlighting you only know that something happened to them and that's it)Overall Cardfight !! Vanguard: Shinemon-hen is a good story but not a big deal since you may take this anime as the direct continuation of G but if you pay attention (to be exact in chapters 29 and 30) you will know that the stories and the facts that each one narrates (especially the first chapters of G) but in general it is enjoyable only for the simple fact of knowing the past of someone who has always been there when you need it (if you follow the series you will know what I mean) with the inclusion of characters that at the end of accounts end up discarded and without importance in the story you only know that they are there but nothing more.While with the development of the characters in my case it seemed a little better and more because it takes you to know the story of misaki but in a slightly more serious and a little better written of the others it is known throughout of the anime (but in the same way without highlighting you only know that something happened to them and that's it)Overall Cardfight !!

It's worth watching if you ever get the opportunity."", '""The Only Way To Save This Family Is For Them To Save The World""The Daichis is one of those series that is so obscure and easy to overlook despite the fact it even got licensed and fully dubbed into English you would be forgiven for not having heard of it. It was this obscurity and ultimately curiosity that led me to watching the show and I\'m so glad I did.So airing in 2001 and animated by Group TAC The Daichis is a series about a family teetering on the edge of oblivion. We have the obese computer obsessed Father Mamoru, the equally work obsessed Mother...Seiko, the teenage Daughter on the verge of a total mental breakdown Nozomi and finally the feisty young kid Dai who is trying to just make the best of it all.The show starts at the breakfast table with Seiko demanding Mamoru for a divorce and asking the kids with whom they want to stay with, Mamoru ignores the request with his face in his laptop. The impression is certainly given that this is just everyday life in the Daichis household. But with the family nearing boiling point a strange fax comes in informing them of Earth\'s imminent destruction by an Alien force and that they have been chosen as the ones to defeat it. Perhaps understandably they somewhat ignore it, though RPG playing Mamoru keeps an eye on it.As the day progresses it becomes apparent that the fax was telling the truth and with planet earth on the brink of destruction this dysfunctional family must unite to take down the Alien invasion and if saving all of Human kind isn\'t enough of a motivation then being paid for the honor of doing so definitely is (with some caveats), at least in the case of Seiko anyway. This is where the heart of the show lies as it\'s this coming together that helps the Family ties mend and heal and frankly it\'s endearing, clever, heartwarming but perhaps most of all funny. If it\'s not young Dai bombing into battle headfirst and certainly headstrong then it\'s Seiko having a nervous breakdown of the cost of every disaster averting action taken which mounts the family into even more debt.Along the way we get some great parodies of pop culture which both serves as good comedy, nice action set pieces but also most importantly character building and exploration. We see why this family is the way they are and how they came to be it. Most interestingly we discover that perhaps despite how much they all care for each other the family may also be too far gone to save. I think it\'s this exploration of family dynamics that really push this show to some high levels and make it a truly special series and one of the best hidden gems around.The character journeys of each member of the family are really well handled and we are exposed to each of them equally and with some amount of depth which by series end helps make all of them very lovable and enjoyable to watch.Animated in 2001 surprisingly this series is cel animated making it most likely one of the last shows of it\'s kind (except for the original version of episode 11, which is mostly digital for some reason). Given this is at the very end of traditional cel animation and with some talented men and women behind the scenes what we are given is a show that looks in no uncertain terms truly fantastic. The transformation scenes of each character are sublime, the action fluid and beautiful and the general animation all round detailed and full of depth. It\'s really a superb looking show and fans of older animation techniques will find alot to appreciate in it, probably much more than when it came out since now we are so far divorced from this traditional style. I just found it a marvel from beginning to end.The Soundtrack is serviceable but not overly memorable. Without the official soundtrack easy to track down either it\'s something I will forget perhaps sooner than I would have. The opening is a fun electronic rock theme that serves at getting the viewer pumped enough for the upcoming episode. The ending is tranquil and fittingly somber as it plays over an old family photo allowing the viewer to contemplate how on earth this family will keep it together and the limits to which it\'s being stretched.Overall this series is truly as I mentioned earlier a hidden gem. It\'s so much more than the sum of it\'s parts would have you believe. The atmosphere of the show will suck you in and whether this Family can keep it together just long enough to save the world and hopefully themselves as a unit ready to fight for another day is both engaging and thought provoking. I really have fallen in love with this show and I think it\'s a shame that it has become so overlooked. To summarize this series in one word - \'Recommended\'.

To summarize this series in one word - \'Recommended\'.', 'all i have to say is every otakou have to watch this series. this is a great classic..its full of action comedy drama and is fun to watch. ', 'This review contains minor spoilers.If you’ve looked through Shouji Kawamori’s massive backlog before, then you’d be aware of the occasional original concept that takes a departure from his iconic mecha anime. For myself, learning about these outliers was surprising, especially with Anyamal Tantei Kiruminzoo, a children’s anime about anthropomorphic magical girls with themes of ecological concern and friendship. Another one of these anime was Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku, which, unlike Kiruminzoo, Kawamori plays a much bigger part in besides just creating the original concept for. Having played a huge role in the script-writing for Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku, I was surprised to learn that this was Kawamori’s...first time writing a comedy anime — because his ability to intertwine complete and utter absurdity through a story about the interpersonal conflicts of a dysfunctional family on the brink of divorce is some of the best you can find within the sphere of comedy-drama anime. If this overly long sentence has piqued your interest, then allow me to introduce you to Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku.Starting off amidst a family deciding which child goes with which parent once the two parents get a divorce, Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku makes itself clear that this is not a normal functional family. A disruptive boy playing with his food who doesn’t want to leave either parent; an apprehensive older girl reluctantly deciding to go with her father; who’s a stereotypical otaku stuck to his computer, avoiding the divorce papers due to a fear of rejection; and a loud-mouthed mother who jokingly threatens those around her and isn’t afraid to say how she feels, no matter how hurtful. What’s more is the incoming fax paper that causes a ruckus at the breakfast table, announcing very suddenly to the family that they must join together as heroes and “Save the Earth”. With no explanation other than the purpose of their mission and how to use their given powers, Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku also makes itself clear that it isn’t afraid to be absurd. It’s loud, it’s fast, it’s weird, and all of this absurdity is about to clash headfirst with the relationships in this dysfunctional family.Dai is the youngest child in the family. He’s a disruptive and crude child, not afraid to cause trouble to those around him to gain attention. At school, he flips the skirts of every girl he runs by, including his teacher. At home, he jumps into the chest of his own mother to piss her off. He’s rude to his sister and talks about literally eating shit with his father (yes, this actually happens). He\'s perverted, inconsiderate, loud, and isn’t afraid of it, so much so that as a viewer, I felt a sense of distaste towards him. However, behind this bombastic personality is a sense of humanity. Humanity that feels as if Dai has lost after living this dysfunctional life with his family. For example, in episode 4, after Dai swallows a mysterious orange ball he found in the previous episode and gets pregnant the next morning with a strange alien rodent (did I mention this anime is absurd?), the family insists that Dai throw it away. Having given birth to the strange creature, Dai understandably doesn’t want to let him go. It’s his own child, and he doesn’t want to give it up like Dai’s mother did to him. This relationship Dai has with the rodent is in direct contrast to his relationship with his mother, who does an incredibly poor job of being a mother figure for him. Dai resents his own mother for this, going so far as to say towards the end of the episode “I can’t believe you call yourself a mother; there is no way I’m abandoning him”, to which she responds, saying “I should’ve abandoned a brat like you long ago”. Both are clearly very reactionary statements, but it goes to show just how Dai’s mother treats him and the reality of his dysfunctional family. This understandably affects Dai immensely, and we’re able to see the extent of this effect in the later episodes. Understanding how Dai has lived a dysfunctional life with his family puts into perspective exactly why he acts the way he does. He seeks attention from others because he never got the right amount from his own parents. He’s crude and inconsiderate because that’s the kind of environment he’s grown up in. He flips up the skirts of girls at his school and causes trouble because he seeks attention that he doesn\'t get from his parents. He jumps into the chests of his mother and his teacher is because he wants to feel the motherly love that he lost. He’s constantly joking around and not taking things seriously because he’s afraid of confronting what’s truly affecting him. This dynamic within Dai’s personality is juxtaposed with the absurdity of the anime, as it\'s used to mask how Dai truly feels inside through a more literal representation that the viewer can feel, which goes to show how strong of an understanding the staff of Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku have of its tone. If this is something that sounds interesting to you, then I implore you to give this anime a chance.One complaint I have with Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku’s storytelling is that Dai is the only character with a fulfilling amount of character development. This is due to the cancellation of the project, putting most of the stories for each character indefinitely on hold. While Nozomi, the oldest child, has some phenomenal episodes that detail her own personal struggles as the only one trying to keep the family together, as well as her experience with love, the parents spend most of their own stories building up their character, which unfortunately never reaches any proper development. That’s why this review is only detailing Dai’s story, as his development essentially represents Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku and its themes as a whole. Now, about this cancellation problem going on.As of writing this, I cannot say for certain why exactly Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku never got a second season; despite clearly setting up for one at the end of this season. The Japanese wiki mentions that it was cancelled during production, but nothing more. There are suspicions that the low VHS sales and a DVD version releasing far too late after the broadcasting are what hindered the popularity of the series. There are rumours that Kawamori doesn’t like it, with the lack of any Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku material showing at one of his events that featured all of his original creations, including Kiruminzoo. However, there is an ever-looming uncertainty surrounding the whole situation, without an answer in sight. But honestly, I’m okay with it.Much like the uncertainty of the family’s divorce and where each character is heading in Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku; we most likely won\'t find out what happened to the project. But despite this constant worry about the future and how things will turn out, it’s important to keep moving forward in life. If Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku ever got an ending, I believe this is the message it would tell the audience. The family is only being held back from divorce by a force they’re unable to control. No matter how hard they try to work together and put their arguments aside, it never works. They’re forever fated into a depressive family dynamic held together only by a necessity to ""save the world"", yet they themselves do not understand what exactly this world they’re saving is, because they’re trapped in their own. Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku’s ending didn’t tie up any loose ends, nor did it deliver any satisfying answers to our questions, but I’m okay with that. Forming our own interpretations and simply moving on with our lives is equally as important, and that\'s the conclusion I\'ve found myself ending at.Just some extra thoughts to round up the review:- The visuals are mind-bogglingly impressive. Each episode is as consistently gorgeous as the previous, right up to the very end. The animation is impressive in particular, as its over-exaggerated movements and expressions add another layer to the absurdity of the world. Shot composition, impressive layouts, and slow pacing complement the more sombre dramatic character moments, while flashy effects, colourful lighting, and exaggerated posing overwhelm the absurd action scenes. It’s a delightful mix that consistently stays great throughout the 13-episode run.- The soundtrack is amazing. With music by Shigeo Naka of “The Surf Coaster”, a surf rock band, his flavour of surf rock and heavily distorted electronics complement every scene of the show more than any other element. The music too has an absurd-serious dynamic going on, with tracks ranging from loud, bombastic guitar solos to harrowing low electronic distortions with vocal scream samples.- It’s honestly impressive just how many elements of art all work together to form the identity of Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku. Art, music, writing, and character performance all ooze absurdity while still being grounded in reality. It’s an impressive mix that I consider to be some of the best you can find within the sphere of comedy-drama anime.Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you decide to give Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku a try. first time writing a comedy anime — because his ability to intertwine complete and utter absurdity through a story about the interpersonal conflicts of a dysfunctional family on the brink of divorce is some of the best you can find within the sphere of comedy-drama anime.

The Daichis serves as a parody of sorts of the sentai genre with the dysfunctional chemistry of the titular family as they get forced into becoming battle suit-powered ""superhumans"" to combat alien threats. The family issues of the family are explored both humorously and seriously where father Mamoru is a weak-minded otaku too spineless to stand up for himself, wife Seiko is too self-centered and greedy to care for her family\'s well-being, daughter Nozomi is stressed from doing all the housework for her family and son Dai is quite the problem child. Their unique circumstances as Earth\'s guardians...slowly bring their family unity back together as they learn that despite how much they can\'t stand the personality quirks and bad habits of one another, they still care for each other.Outside of the family drama from the Daichis, the sentai element tosses in the typical ""monster of the day"" type plots of the genre which also add into the comedy of the series coming from the family\'s various abilities and the monsters they battle. For instance, the family gets charged money for each of the more over-the-top abilities they make use of against alien threats and they rack up quite a debt as a result thus the family resorts to keeping use of such powers to a minimum in later episodes of the series so their debt doesn\'t rack up any higher. Some of the alien threats they have to confront also prove to be quite silly to see battle such as evil toys, a heart-shaped spacecraft and even an alien shaped in the form of the old Soviet emblem in a form of politically incorrect satire.This won\'t be a series for anyone who doesn\'t enjoy manic comedies or sentai shows. But if you are a fan of these elements and like them mixed with the problematic issues of the modern Japanese family, The Daichis: Earth Defense Family proves to be a fun little romp thanks to its parodies of the sentai genre and the dysfunctional chemistry between the Daichis. slowly bring their family unity back together as they learn that despite how much they can\'t stand the personality quirks and bad habits of one another, they still care for each other.Outside of the family drama from the Daichis, the sentai element tosses in the typical ""monster of the day"" type plots of the genre which also add into the comedy of the series coming from the family\'s various abilities and the monsters they battle.

Though some of the plots may seem skewed because of the poor translations, the story is clear and I think it is a great series. ', 'Chikyuu Bouei Kazoku did everything it set out to do well.The portrayal of a dysfunctional family is so cruelly well done that it hurts to remind me of all the times my own family acted that way.In the first few episodes we see Seiko, the mother figure furthest from perfection, saying that she should have abandoned her son. Conflicts develop and, between disappointments and mutual understanding, we have this relationship veering a little towards the right direction in the end.Mamoru, the father who doesn\'t give security to anyone in the family, spends the entire anime showing he accepts how pathetic he himself is. His most...brave scene being to defend an alien who was the only existence that valued him (for his own interests), shows how desperate he is for recognition.

Seiko seeks recognition in an extramarital relationship, Mamoru, who only wanted recognition for himself, enters an anxiety loop and can\'t get out of the place. Nozomi, who doesn\'t even have the recognition of her own family, seems to be the most used to it, but begins, cathartically, to throw responsibilities away and Dai shows that despite seeming not to care about anything, he still has feelings.The comic time, fundamental for an anime like this, which aims to be funny while showing real problems, was masterfully used from start to finish. The jokes presented in different ways, making good use of the production, have a whole charm, being specific to each character in focus. Fortunately most of the necessary information was tied up, giving the show a decent ending: In the end, they finally managed to beat a monster without owing money. Now just pay off the debt of approximately 500 million Yen and they can quit their job. brave scene being to defend an alien who was the only existence that valued him (for his own interests), shows how desperate he is for recognition.

Choujuushin Gravion Zwei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1149/Choujuushin_Gravion_Zwei,"['If you are into the cliche mecha anime story then this is your ticket.I would however advise you that if do watch this to the end be prepared with disappointment.The Story is over done the Art is decent the sound as wellThe Character development is a little screwed up.. The mysterious of the people are predictable the rich guy is annoying in my eyes and the main characters in the series have no defining closure with in their respective relation shipsI would pass on this one. there are way better mecha anime out there ', 'This review is partly for both seasons. As i found this season much more satisfying then the first and ill get to that later.Gravion is your typical old school mecha show with plenty of fan service to suit your needs of that desire to look at naked girls or ""maids"" as they are in the show. If your a fan of echii, then you will see alot of it, even more so in the 2nd season.The formula of the series as a whole, is pretty generic, robots fighting some form of unknown alien existence that threatens mankind. They are known as the zeravire. The...team of the G pilots that pilot the mecha called the ""gravion"" is the team that is under the command of a billionaire named Sandman who leads this team of fighters to victory against the onslaught of the Zeravire.The first season is at most pretty predictable throughout the show, just alot of action against the zeravire. Plenty of comedy bits with the maids and over the top action. There is a bit of a story that is central to the series though that is very subtle in the first season. But if you can manage to muster the first season, you will be treated to a much more satisfying plot in the 2nd season. The characterization is definitely stronger as you get to see the characters develop in different ways and you get to see there different personalities. There are some very dark deep secrets that are only unveiled in this 2nd season that i do say so my self really caught me off guard. So if your a fan of mecha or echhi, i say give this show a shot. It definitely probably wont live up to ""power house shows"" like Code geass, and the Gundam Franchise. But  after watching it my self i did actually enjoy it to the extent of wanting to watch every episode of this season with out stopping, there was some pretty surprising story developments and that is what i like in this anime. team of the G pilots that pilot the mecha called the ""gravion"" is the team that is under the command of a billionaire named Sandman who leads this team of fighters to victory against the onslaught of the Zeravire.The first season is at most pretty predictable throughout the show, just alot of action against the zeravire.

Who is this for and why does this exist? Seriously, it\'s not for kids due to the constant oversexualization of every female character, the jiggle physics on some of these women is insane, even by anime standards (I have no idea how this isn\'t tagged as an ecchi series, because that\'s definitely what it is). This series isn\'t for those that like good... anything. Characters, story, art, music, all of it is unoriginal, average or just downright terrible.Characters are bland and lack any originality in design and personality, the story is practically nonexistent and...only progresses this season. When the story is actually important and there\'s not another filler episode where the girls play dressup for the coomers in the audience, it\'s uninspired and uninteresting, I was so bored that I had to watch the series on 2x speed, and even then it was pure misery. The art is lackluster, even from 2004, there has been much better TV animation in that year, and even though it looks cheap, the colours are too sharp making your eyes bleed. The music was mostly unmemorable and constantly made me think ""oh, that\'s like that one other song"".Even if you are a mecha fan/fanatic, there is nothing new or cool here to entertain you, it is the living embodiment of the \'average shitty mecha show\'.There is zero reason for this series to exist and especially for anyone to watch it, if you somehow landed on this anime\'s page and are considering to watch it, my advice, steer clear of it, you will save yourself precious time better put elsewhere. only progresses this season.

Bayonetta: Bloody Fate,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20543/Bayonetta__Bloody_Fate,"[""Before I start this review I must start by saying Bayonetta is easilyone of my Favorite over the top action adventure games EVA!!This movie i feel is for those who have mainly played the game bayonetta. if you have not, It might not be worth seeing this.Anyhow, seeing that there was an anime based on the game i was worried at first, that is until i got the chance to watch it.The Movie for the most part was quite fun.however Not as fun as playing the actual game though.For those who have play the game Bayonetta you'll will be pleased...to know that they have incorporated the characters and some of the soundtracks from the actual game to make this feel like the game itself. but does it live up to it?Story - 5Yes it is a bizarre story.( The Prologue )In the remote part of Europe is a place called Vigrid where there lies the observers of history,  Among them are 2 Main organizations they are known as Umbra witches (representing Darkness) they known to be in league with demons and the Lumen sages (representing light) who ally themselves with the angels.These 2 organizations were protectors in charge of keeping the right balance of the world between the 2 however that decree was suddenly violated by one witch and one sage that bound them together producing a child.The witch was imprisoned and the sage was banished. It was An entity between light and darkness was said to bring calamity to the world and now the legend was finally about to be realized however 'you guessed it' this starts a war between angels and demons that then soon fades into the obscure dormant of history, That is only the beginning.Now in the present day we start with a journalist named Luka,investigating a mysterious woman who he seems to hold a personal grudge against.That women is Bayonetta. We follow the story of the witch known as Bayonetta, as she defeats these crazy ass blood-thirsty Angels in her path and tries to remember her past from before the time she was awaken 20 years ago along with some of the other characters like Enzo bayonetta's information broker, Jeanne Bayonetta's closest rival, Rodin a renowned demon weapons dealer as well as a bartender, Cereza a mysterious little girl and of course Luka.Characters - 7Simply put the characters are exactly who they are in the game and nothing morewhich is a plus.Bayonetta is one of the Coolest, Sexiest, unadulterated all-out protagonist in video gaming in my opinion, She displays this in her nicely stylish long black hair and librarian glasses with such a lovely, enticing, witty attitude and her Epic abilities and powers which to me easily gets a thumbs up. all of the other supporting characters are in this as well and they too represent themselves as they are in the game which is Good,The Downside is do not watch this anime for character development because there isn't to be honest. After all it is based of a crazy hack n' slash video game after all despite the lack of enemies, bosses and mad situations that happens compared to the game itself.Art - 6I am not that much of a fan of Gonzo from their previous anime productions,The art style was nice don't get me wrong. Its just for me, the action scenes howeverwere not animated that well unfortunatelywhich is why I don't usually favor Gonzo animation that much,I thought the CG backdrops were used poorly within this film as it stood out while it should of blended into the background even with the use of some blood in the sceneswhich they tried to make it seem like its Hardcore popcorn fun.I'm not too sure if I was impressed at the time or maybe I just didn't seem to care.It does capture some of the over the top action I'm used to seeing in the game itself.But I felt there should of been a lot of more better ones from the game sinceOh I don't know, ITS FREAKING BAYONETTA!!A Dominatrix with many abilities, many transformations, Weapons, Incredible finisherseven more so than Dante from devil may cry himself and of courseshe has some great Ass-ets. ; )Sound - 6To be fair the anime is Based off the 2009 game along with a few soundtracksfrom the game, Not all mind you though.Its missing better soundtracks from the game indeedand to be honest its still really not my cup of tea anyways.I'm not saying the soundtracks are bad.I just felt maybe the sound effects could of sounded better and possibly they could of used more of the video game's better soundtracks in the fight scenes. It would bring some good vibes from the game to inject it into this movie to give it more of them Bayonet Feels OOH YEEAHH..Enjoyment/Overall - 6I didn't mind watching this movie in my spare time after all I do LOVE Bayonetta.Bayonetta Bloody Fate is Only just a decent film at best which could of beenmore fulfilling for fans to check out if they had done better with the material they had,I think for some depending on who you are, I honestly advise you to play the gamebecause as I said its an Awesome game!.With this film, I feel it was trying to imitate those very elements of the game and to me it didn't really pay off that much, but then again it is quite a lot of game content to put into a normal feature length film.HOWEVER, If there is something I could at least give credit for it is this..At least it was better than that Shitty Devil may cry anime adaptation imo and that is all.for gamers into action games If you like the first bayonetta game, Also Play bayonetta 2since its even more Better if you do have an nintendo wii that is and if you do, Lucky you. to know that they have incorporated the characters and some of the soundtracks from the actual game to make this feel like the game itself. but does it live up to it?Story - 5Yes it is a bizarre story.( The Prologue )In the remote part of Europe is a place called Vigrid where there lies the observers of history,  Among them are 2 Main organizations they are known as Umbra witches (representing Darkness) they known to be in league with demons and the Lumen sages (representing light) who ally themselves with the angels.These 2 organizations were protectors in charge of keeping the right balance of the world between the 2 however that decree was suddenly violated by one witch and one sage that bound them together producing a child.The witch was imprisoned and the sage was banished.

Think carefully about this question. Watching anime is essentially seeing a sequence of events set to music and sound. Under this definition, there could conceivably be an anime about anything, even grass growing. The reason this hasn't happened yet is because no one would care. Sure, things are happening, but why does that matter to you? You could go outside right now and see grass grow, or you could watch something you care more about, so watching Grass-chan Adventures is understandably low on your priority list. But why is that? Why do you care about some things more than...others, even though both things are equally happening? The answer is emotional investment.Bayonetta has a lot of things happening at any given time. Guns get shot, monsters get killed, poses get posed, one-liners get tossed around, there's never a moment when things aren't happening. But much like our kawaii Grass-chan, you're never given a reason to care. Why is Bayonetta killing angels? Why are angels killing everyone? Why are some people ghosts sometimes? Why is God evil? What was with that car? Why did Jeanne shoot all those people on that train, and why was Bayonetta there? Where was she going? Where was she ever going? Why did anything happen at all? For an hour and thirty minutes, things are happening, but these questions are never answered. The bad guy is trying to revive the biggest bad guy for... some reason? Is it God? Shouldn't people be stoked to hear that God is coming to Earth? You're never told what the stakes are, so you never care why Bayonetta's fighting. You never see her struggle, so you have no reason to care when she succeeds. You never see her in any danger of losing, so seeing her win becomes meaningless. It just turns into a sequence of events. Bayonetta beats this bad guy, so now she's going to fight this other bad guy, and she's going to win but we're not quite there yet. There's nothing to think about, no surprises, no doubt, no reason to keep watching these things happening. It's just grass growing.I haven't played the game that Bayonetta is based on, so I don't know how this adaption compares to the original. But I know immediately where all the emotional investment went. When you play a game, you supply the emotion. Just making progress gives you a reason to care, since you've now invested your time towards beating the game. You learn the price of failure if you die, which adds excitement to the fights as you try to avoid that same failure. You learn the capabilities of your character, what she can and can't do, and you add your own skill in order to overcome the obstacles presented to you. Just playing the game is enough to make you care. The story and cutscenes are nice rewards for your progress, but the goal is progress itself. This is why a straight adaption just doesn't work. There's no inherent difficulty in watching anime (except for downloading codecs and stuff, but you get the point). Once you start watching, you won't fail and have to start over if you don't beat the boss. Your skill has no bearing on whether or not the protagonist succeeds. You have no control over how or why things happen, so you need another reason to invest your time. You can't help the main character fight, but you can still care if they win or lose if you're given a good enough reason. Bayonetta just doesn't give you a reason.Bayonetta isn't ALL bad. Norio Goddamn Wakamoto voices one of the leads, which makes absolutely any show better (see Wizard Barristers for an example). The art is good, if you've ever seen a Madhouse production it looks exactly like that style. Bayonetta has some killer tits. Beyond that, it's hard to think of any other positive points.Should you watch Grass-chan Adventures? Maybe, if it ever comes out. You'd probably feel the same way watching Bayonetta. Should you watch Bayonetta? Not really. The only thing this movie really has going for it is the action, which is just bland and predictable. The story is a jumbled mess, the characters are boring, and the things that happen just aren't interesting. Your time would be better spent watching something else. others, even though both things are equally happening?

It\'s a watchable movie, in no way absolutely awful, but it is definetely nothing special.The story is what you already know from the games, but its development is somewhat convulted and rushed as you might expect from a game that has some actual plot adapted into a movie. The scrips are bland, Bayonetta is Bayonetta, and the rest of the chars are just ""there"" 90% of the time, theres...nothing noteworthy about them. Terrible villain and development for the villain.The art ranged from orgasmic, to above average but sometimes it dropped to pretty bad, I have no idea why some frames where so neglected by the artists, but overall the art is pretty good. The sound effects are decent but the music imho, is horrible. They seemed to try and make a game soundtrack instead of a movie soundtrack, and it wasnt pulled off adequately.You\'ll somewhat enjoy the movie as a Bayonetta fan, but likely feel very dissapointed in some other regards, if you like the character or wanna kill time and are interested then watch the movie, all youll be seeing the movie for is Bayonetta. nothing noteworthy about them.

Compared to the game, a lot of things were cut out, and it only really focused on the major plot points. I suppose it is rather hard to fit a 10+ hour video game into a 1 and a half hour movie, but still.I did enjoy the soundtrack though, and the animation; I especially enjoyed the extra scene in the hotel that didn't appear...in the game at all. But other than that, the movie chopped and changes a lot of the scenes, making it almost a completely different setting from the game.But; at the end of the day, I honestly enjoyed the movie despite these flaws, and  because it was Bayonetta after all. in the game at all.

READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!""Video games movies are a hard bunch. How do you take a video game and translate it into live action? Will you take the risk of having a gigantic budget to achieve this goal by not only trying to make the movie look like the game but staying true to it\'s source or will you just half-ass the entire game by turning the movie that based of that certain property into a bunch of nothing? These are the questions that always linger to gamers and audiences whenever studios, either...from Hollywood or international countries, decides on making movies based on games. The problem? They have no idea how to translate something that was great in a game into a film and even those who admit that it is a common problem to movie based games, they still f*ck it up when making a movie that tries too hard on being like the game. While they are several movies like Wreck-It Ralph! Prince of Persia and DOA: Dead or Alive (yes, that film based on a fighting game filled with bouncing boob physics) proving that games can be translated well into film, the majority like DOOM, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, Postal, Far Cry, House of the Dead, Bloodrayne and all those unnecessary Resident Evil movies gives the genre an awful reputation. However, when you make an animated adaptation based off a game, it could get mixed results but work a lot better than live-action. Again, that\'s because animation is full of possibilities for any kind of project that can be limitless if you execute it correctly and this is something that almost works for animated movies based on video games like Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie or Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike, which allows filmmaker and animators to make a unique adaptation while still staying true to the spirit of the games that were based off.This is where Bayonetta: Bloody Fate comes in and to find out whenever this film lives up to the spirit of the games or not.For those who had never heard of Bayonetta or watched the TV spots for it\'s Wii U sequel Bayonetta 2 while still not having a clue on who she is, let me tell you the backstory. Bayonetta is a third-person hack and slash action game that was published by SEGA for the PS3 & XBOX 360 while being developed by Platinum Games (originally known as Clover Studios before CAPCOM shut down the studio due to Okami\'s poor sales for the PS2 and the studio was founded by Hideki Kamiya, Keiji Inafune and Atsushi Inaba) and the game acts as a spiritual successor to Devil May Cry since Hideki Kamiya not only directed Bayonetta but also he was responsible for Devil May Cry. It follows the story of Bayonetta, a sexy, seductive and charming witch who fights angels while trying to discover her secret origin behind the downfall of the Umbran Witches and the Lumen Sages and meeting up with some friends that might know more about Bayonetta than her own self. Let me get this out of the way and say that I love Bayonetta. No, scratch that, I just ADORE Bayonetta. Not only is the game fun but it contains one of the best female characters in gaming history. She is sexualized but doesn\'t bother her because she enjoys being sexy and takes sh*t from no one, she has a dark but wicked personality and a good sense of humor. Plus, she can release a can a whoop-ass with her hair as a magic weapon that allows her to release demons from Inferno and use the demons against the army of angels that swarm in her path. The game is also challenging but fun to play, the combat makes Devil May Cry dropped it\'s jaw with it\'s incredibly fast paced combos, the voice acting is wonderfully solid (that Joe Pesci impression that Chick Venerra makes is spot on as Enzo), the music is bloody amazing and the story, while crazy as hell, is still a really good story filled with very interesting lore of the Umbran Witches and Lumen Sages. The game was so damn impressive that it got a sequel to the Wii U due to poor sales in the US release for Bayonetta, SEGA dropping the rights to the franchise without giving any form of support and Nintendo greatly helping funding the sequel to Platinum Games.Imagine my surprise when a Bayonetta anime film was announced back in 2013 and boy, did fans went crazy for this. Who wouldn\'t be hyped considering Fuminori Kizaki (the director behind AFRO SAMURAI) is helming the film while Gonzo is behind the task of bringing Bayonetta to full colored form. As for me, I wasn\'t hyped but I was truly excited to see Bayonetta back in a new way and in an anime no less. I sat down, watched it and after it was over... It just kinda ended. By all means, it wasn\'t a horrible film but the amount of potential of Bayonetta combined with animation was sorta lost in this adaptation and it marks my biggest problem with the movie but I\'m getting ahead of myself, let\'s start at the beginning shall we?The story in Bloody Fate is just like in the games but with little differences. It still centers around Bayonetta on searching for her answers of the past while dealing with other characters like Luka, a young journalist who has connections with Bayonetta due to him thinking that she killed her father when she was found at the bottom of the lake, Jeanne, an Umbran Witch that may have connections to her past and Balder, a powerful man who\'s conjuring up some mischievous plan to resurrect a great goddess in order to change the universe. The good thing about the story is that for those who never played Bayonetta can easily watch this film and understand the whole plot of the film without being required to play the game. That said though, the big problem is that the film\'s story is handled like a freaking mess with the film literally spoiling the big twists at the beginning of the damn movie. I get that fans of the game won\'t be bothered by this but for the common viewer that has never heard of or played Bayonetta, it is a big glaring problem when a story doesn\'t take it\'s time in developing the story and it\'s twists properly by instantly throwing it to our faces. For example, the scene in The Gates of Hell showed Enzo telling Bayonetta and the audiences that Balder might be up to something really bad that stupidly gives away the surprise connection between Bayonetta and Balder. Also, some of the changes in the characters are really bothering to me like again with Balder. While the other characters including Bayonetta are perfectly translated into film, the way the film handles Balder is one of the biggest screw ups in the film. To explain why I find this bothersome, I have to go into big spoiler territory into Bayonetta 1 & 2 to explain why:For me, I find Balder to be an engaging sympathetic villain that may have started out as an evil bad guy in the first game but with Bayonetta 2, it reveals a lot more of Balder that we thought was impossible to execute but it did and worked. Balder is a man that not only was claimed as a great Lumen Sage among his clan but he was a man who wanted to have a family with the love of his life at her side, who\'s revealed to be Rosa, Bayonetta\'s mother and one day, they did by giving birth to a child by giving her the name Cereza, Bayonetta\'s original name from the first game. However, fate begins to turn ugly when the Umbran Elder, discovering the truth behind the relationship between Rosa, Balder and their child while also being furious about the truth, forbids them from having the child due to the laws of the Umbran and the Lumens that they are forbidden to express love or have any kind of relationship in order to keep the balance of the light and darkness at bay. For this, both Rosa and Balder are charged with treason and imprisoned while their child is forbidden to learn the arts of combat of the Umbran clan while being separated from her mother. Balder expressed great hatred against both the clans for destroying their connections and this triggers the events of ""The Witch Hunts"" when the spirit Loptr, who is later revealed to be a split spirit from ""The Eyes of the World"" jewels and was the split personality of Loki (good) and Balder (evil), he let Loptr possess his body and thus, the massacre of the clans began with Rosa getting killed in the process while Balder suffers as his malevolent spirit using his body destroys everything he hold dears while he does nothing but watch and grief. In the end of Bayonetta 2 where both Bayonetta and a young Balder defeat Loptr, Balder sacrifices his own body by getting the spirit of Loptr back in his body to prevent him on destroying the past yet again while apologizing to Bayonetta for not being there for her when needed and asked her to call him ""Daddy"" one last time before his pure soul becomes corrupted once more. This whole summary is why I like Balder cause he is a villain but I can understand his torment and suffering of not seeing her own daughter because that chance of happiness was taken from him and in the end, he gets the chance to fight alongside her daughter one last time before fading away with Loptr being inside his soul. This backstory could have provided so much for this more but instead, the movie decides to make him the generic ""the world is terrible and must be destroyed to be reborn a better place while being blinded from his own loved one"" stereotypical villian and did I mention that his final battle is beyond weak? He gets killed off very quickly for 3 minutes and that\'s it! That\'s the biggest waste of potential I\'ve seen for a villain since M.Bison from the Street Fighter The Movie.Speaking of action and animation, Bloody Fate is a mixed bag. When the animation and action gets good, it gets really good with animation being extremely fluid with tiny visual details during the flashy battles that stays true to the spirit of the game\'s maniacal action and the animation manages to translate the look of the game perfectly with little changes done to the character designs since director Fuminori Kizaki and character designer Ai Yokoyama are fans of the games and did an aoutstanding job at executing the feel and look of Bayonetta wonderfully. However, when the action stops and we get back to the main plot, the animation gets a huge downgrade with backgrounds, while looking very nice, barely having substance to bring the world to life. There\'s barely people in the whole film minus the scenes on the train, the news footage and the highway sequence but that\'s really about it and while the character designs look nice, the models themselves don\'t really seem very life-like since most of the models just stand around while objects move around the background and the CG looks very off at times cause it doesn\'t really go well with the hand-drawn animation during various sequences of action. Reason? It\'s because GONZO is infamous for having budget issues and adding CG to every show or movie they worked on and while not all of GONZO\'s projects are a mess (Romeo X Juliet, Gankutsuo: The Count of Monte Cristo, Welcome to the NHK and AFRO SAMURAI are my favorites work from GONZO), they tend to get screwed over their own budget constraints that results into badly unfinished animated sequences (like for example; Samurai 7, where one episode showcases creepy looking unfinished character models dancing creepily like ghosts and it looked like a nightmare). While Bayonetta: Bloody Fate looks better than GONZO\'S other projects and a better control over it\'s budget, it still contains some animation misfires that prevent this film from achieving animation perfection status. Also, the movie misses the mark on making more animated sequences with Bayonetta fighting the big 4 angels and I kid you not, there is no epic battles with Fortitudo, Temperatina, Iustitia and Sapientia but instead, reduced to pointless cameos that are never mentioned again. Really film?! You\'re gonna pass the chance at making unique action sequences for these 4 boss angels that provided one of the best boss battles in gaming history and only provide them cameos for Fortitudo and Temperatina?! What were they thinking!Now for the grand finale of Bloody Fate: The dub by Funimation. I\'m happy to report that the dub for Bloody Fate is pretty good with Funimation getting the entire cast to dub the film including Helena Taylor as Bayonetta, Grey DeLisle as Jeanne, John Kassir as Enzo, Dave Fennoy as Rodin, Yuri Lowenthal as Luka, Joy Jillian as Cereza and J. Grant Albrecth as Balder with the entire cast obviously having a blast with minor faults that goes to Joy Jillian and J. Grant Albrecth sounding very off in their roles since in the games, both of these actors gave wonderful performances that sounded distinct and unique. Also, Patrick Seitz and Dave Fennoy\'s perfomances as Fortitudo and Temperatina are OK but I wished they speaked in that menacing angelic language instead of hearing it in English. Also, Richard Epcar\'s voice narration in the beginning was pretty cool, so kudos.Overall, Bayonetta: Bloody Fate is a disappointment for fans of the game expecting a new ambitious take on the game but it is an enjoyable adaptation that manages to capture the charm and relentless action that made Bayonetta awesome to play. GONZO and Fuminori Kizaki deserves lots of credits for trying their damnest to make a solid adaption of the game and If you\'re a fan of the games or just curious, Bloody Fate deserves just one watch but at least it gives us a glimpse look on more possibilities for a Bayonetta anime film or series if any animation studio in Japan wants to take at another stab on this seductive witch. from Hollywood or international countries, decides on making movies based on games. The problem? They have no idea how to translate something that was great in a game into a film and even those who admit that it is a common problem to movie based games, they still f*ck it up when making a movie that tries too hard on being like the game. While they are several movies like Wreck-It Ralph! Prince of Persia and DOA: Dead or Alive (yes, that film based on a fighting game filled with bouncing boob physics) proving that games can be translated well into film, the majority like DOOM, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, Postal, Far Cry, House of the Dead, Bloodrayne and all those unnecessary Resident Evil movies gives the genre an awful reputation. However, when you make an animated adaptation based off a game, it could get mixed results but work a lot better than live-action. Again, that\'s because animation is full of possibilities for any kind of project that can be limitless if you execute it correctly and this is something that almost works for animated movies based on video games like Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie or Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike, which allows filmmaker and animators to make a unique adaptation while still staying true to the spirit of the games that were based off.This is where Bayonetta: Bloody Fate comes in and to find out whenever this film lives up to the spirit of the games or not.For those who had never heard of Bayonetta or watched the TV spots for it\'s Wii U sequel Bayonetta 2 while still not having a clue on who she is, let me tell you the backstory. Bayonetta is a third-person hack and slash action game that was published by SEGA for the PS3 & XBOX 360 while being developed by Platinum Games (originally known as Clover Studios before CAPCOM shut down the studio due to Okami\'s poor sales for the PS2 and the studio was founded by Hideki Kamiya, Keiji Inafune and Atsushi Inaba) and the game acts as a spiritual successor to Devil May Cry since Hideki Kamiya not only directed Bayonetta but also he was responsible for Devil May Cry. It follows the story of Bayonetta, a sexy, seductive and charming witch who fights angels while trying to discover her secret origin behind the downfall of the Umbran Witches and the Lumen Sages and meeting up with some friends that might know more about Bayonetta than her own self. Let me get this out of the way and say that I love Bayonetta. No, scratch that, I just ADORE Bayonetta. Not only is the game fun but it contains one of the best female characters in gaming history. She is sexualized but doesn\'t bother her because she enjoys being sexy and takes sh*t from no one, she has a dark but wicked personality and a good sense of humor.

Seriously, I don't think there is one person here who didn't come to watch this without having played the games first and if you are someone who has not played it you should  before even watching this.Story 6/10The story itself does not change from the game for the most part. It also retains most aspects from the original game. However, if you already played the games this is not anything new at all.  There is no presence of a new concept and most the events...that followed are as they are in the game. To put this game in the  hour and a half time frame they did have to rush the hell out of the story as well so be  prepared for that. Most of things you thought you were going to see aren't present in this film.Art 9/10I really enjoyed the art used in this Movie. It really represents the game well and all the characters look exactly as they did in the game and you even get to see some of the awesome weapons that were in the game like the Shuraba. I also loved the fact they didn't copy every little scene and presented somewhat of different settings while still following the story.  I really wish they included some of the other angels that did not make an appearance in this film like Golem or Grace and Glory.Sound 10/10They pleased me very much so by not fixing what wasn't broken and that is the music and voice actors. I watched in the English dub and I gotta hand it to them for getting the same or very similar actors who played in the English version of the game.  They also brought back personal favorites of mine from the game such as Mysterious Destiny and Fly Me Too the Moon.Characters 8/10Exactly as they were in game so if you enjoyed them in game there is no doubt you'll enjoy them here. While some of the script is kind of rehashed just for the movie I still find them quite enjoyable. Simple as that.Overall 8/10Very good at retelling the story to me and they did a great job of keeping the action as presented in game. If you have played the games you should definitely watch this movie when you got the free time but just note there is nothing new the game didn't show. The movie did explain some things such as the actual correlation between Bayonetta, Cereza, and Balder if you couldn't guess just by playing the game but other than that there is nothing new. But, if you have not already played the games I high;y recommend it before watching the movie as it is a better experience and has more detailed than what this could have possibly packed in 1 and a half hours. that followed are as they are in the game.

I find the idea of a witch waking up after centuries and having to kill all these angels cool if I'm getting that right, but the presentation is so shallow. The animation isn't the worse but it's painfully average. The storytelling is so bad. Things just happen for ninety minutes and then roll credits. There's no excitement in...any aspect of this.

Interesting enough to keep me watching the whole thing although the ending is easy enough to guess from not far in.ART: 7/10Cool 90’s style looking animation. Was reasonably well done, only a few scene felt kind...of dark and occasionally the heads looked really small in proportion to their bodies in wide shots, otherwise it was fine.SOUND: 5/10No reaction much for myself either way although it seemed to fit it well enough and some of the comments below where I was watching it were commenting on how several of the game remixes were used so that’s cool.CHARACTER: 5/10As good as you can expect for a movie where they kind of expect you to know who they are going in, with the basics explained or done so in expositions and not through character’s actions.ENJOYMENT: 8/10Although I didn’t get as much as a hard core Bayonetta fan would have I’m sure, I enjoyed this. It was a sexy witch lady with her clothes turning into hair and being partially naked while beating down hordes of freaky angels with the occasional innuendo.OVERALL: 6/10Good if you like Bayonetta and want an easy way to pass the time.

Di Gi Charat: Hoshi no Tabi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1752/Di_Gi_Charat__Hoshi_no_Tabi,"['This OVA is only recommended for people who already saw and liked the main anime; if you didn\'t there is no reason for you to see this one. This anime is an old comedy nonsense and made to promote a certain store from Akihabara. That means the story is nothing but relaxed and focused to make you laugh, don\'t expect a drama. The art is kinda bad even for an old anime but I think it is done on purpose, it helps build the mood.The music on this anime is as good as the previous. The use of another variant of the sticky song ""party...night"" is a safe decision but  there is nothing new. The voices are acceptable or at least there wasn\'t anything that drag the anime down. Every important character from the anime makes an appearance that can make the fans laugh.This OVA is done for the fans. Personally, I saw the anime a long time ago and this bring a lot of memories from the anime. The humor is somewhat relaxing and meant for everybody to just sit and relax a couple of minutes. Since this is that kind of anime I give it an 8, because it is very good but not near great. night"" is a safe decision but  there is nothing new.

It develops the pre-existing characters very well. However, most of the characters that were introduced exclusively for this movie are not developed.The story revolves around the Dragon Balls, just like everything else related to this series; some evil character appears and tries to grab a hold on the Dragon Balls in order to rule/destroy the world.

This movie was alrigth, but like all of the DBZ movie it has some plot holes. Like krillin not being suprised that Goku has a son, While he seems suprised in the first episode of DBZ. Overall it was pretty short and  the battle was not that great. In my opinon only watch this if your a fan of DBZ if not than just watch the series. ', ""When I look back on the very first DBZ movie, I always find it ironic how it's actually among the best in the line up. Each of the following movies venture the exact same path, which is to provide the viewer with low brow entertainment through lots of action and comedy. I have no beef with this. The problem is, once you get pass the first batch of movies, you start to sense the lack of innovation and even creativity. They become unbelievably gimmicky and that feel of a cash in is all over the place. Dragon Ball Z is definitely an anime series you...must be a die hard fan of to consistently enjoy.Dragon Ball Z: The Dead Zone is a pretty fun title. It feels a lot more like the Dragon Ball series, as it takes the viewer on a near non stop action-filled ride. Almost from the very beginning, the action begins and rarely lets up, and it's actually a real joy to watch. The production values pretty much delivers; the battles do utilize that boring reused cel format, but the energy attacks and minimum choreography provide the fun. Especially during one of the moments when Goku is dodging and blocking various attacks from the combined might of the main villains goons.There are also some nice background shots of the palace they battle in, and later on in the destroyed ruins of the place. The battles at different points takes place during the evening under an orange sun set that looks really nice. Now normally when it comes down to voice acting, I prefer to watch the dub because that way I can focus better on animation and music without having to look down at subs. This is one of those rare moments I can't tolerate the dub though. The voice acting itself isn't the problem, but there's this one musical scene that takes place with Gohan that is far better in the sub, because it actually contains the song. While in English, the entire scene feels bland. On top of this, I do believe the sieyuu is far better, with the legendary Kamiya Akira voicing lead villain Garlic Jr and Masako Nozawa voicing Goku. They had some really good chemistry going here.The plot follows Goku as he tracks Gohan to the villain Garlic Jr. Garlic gathers the Dragon Balls to make a wish, and from here fist start flying again. During the later movies, characters will appear only to be taken down in record time. Here, characters like Piccolo and even Krillin are used pretty well.One of the main problems I've always heard about this movie was the 45 minute length. When looking at the fact this is a franchise flick that rarely has a good plot to work with anyway, and a majority of the time the action scenes aren't breaking any new ground. I just can't see length as a problem. If anything, Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone feels too ordinary even for that time.Overall, this is a solid movie that actually fits into main continuity, something you won't see often in the later movies. The action scenes do depict character deaths yet it's nothing over the top. The movie feels child friendly for the most part. Fans of the series will more than likely enjoy this. Newbies really shouldn't start here since character development is non existant. For them, I recommend coming into the first season of the main series. If that piques your interest enough to move further, then go ahead and give this a shot.Highs: Short and to the point, knows what it wants to beLows: Average at best, mainly for fans of franchise must be a die hard fan of to consistently enjoy.Dragon Ball Z: The Dead Zone is a pretty fun title.

As for the villains, I found them forgettable.Animation was very good funny enough, especially during the fight sequences as they look very fluid in combat. For a film that was aired back in 1989 during its initial release its surprisingly well done for something that came out over 25 years ago.Music was also okay but nothing memorable.The thing I didn't like in the film was the ending which was lame since the villain being immortal seals himself with his own move called the dead zone which for some reason is the title of this film and that to me is a dumb move for a villain with immortality to possess and I was also quite put off by  gohan who starts getting high and going off into his own fantasy world being somewhere up in cloud 9 but all in all I feel this was mainly a mindless and not so long film to get through thankfully so despite having really dumb villains I still found this easy just to get through,All in all, its a very simplistic film meant for action and just passing some time.

The first film in the series, Dead Zone, despite some minor inaccuracies, is essentially a forty minute prequel to the major Dragon Ball Z series. If I had to sum this movie up, it's the perfect union of the original Dragon Ball, beginning to integrate with the more modern Dragon Ball Z. It's fun, it's gorgeous (especially for a film from 1989!), and it's in a package that's essentially an extended...episode of Dragon Ball Z.I adore the art design for this film - the deep oranges and reds of Garlic Jr's castle is a fantastic setting for the main conflict of this film,  which I honestly feel is better then many of the other settings in the rest of the Dragon Ball Z series. They also, amazingly, nailed the transformation of Garlic Jr - I was wondering how they'd make such a diminutive goblin-looking guy into an actual decent antagonist, and they pulled it off. The effortless nature he takes down Goku and Piccolo prior to their power-up moment is really entertaining to watch, and the sequence where he hunts them down in total darkness was a highlight of the film.The action is fantastic in this movie - the highlights of which is Goku's 1-on-3 against Garlic Jr's squad, and Goku struggling with the sword duel later on in the fight (On a tangent, I finally know what that scene from the Western OP of DBZ is from now!). It's also nice to see everyone get a little bit of the action, except for Krillian, who really seems relegated sadly to babysitter for a couple of minutes. It wouldn't have worked in the film, but I was a little sad to see Goku and Piccolo only exchange a few blows, but the prospect of a movie-level brawl between the two is exciting. The unique placement in the timeline is one of the most engaging parts of the film, as Piccolo is barely an ally at all - whilst we love him today as ally of the cast, and Gohan's better dad, there is something just so cool and exciting at seeing a antagonistic Piccolo.I also really appreciated how they blended the more childish and silly humour of Dragon Ball with the more combat focused elements, with all the yelps and freak-outs from Goku and Krillin. Though, I have to say, Gohan's weird apple-based drug-trip went on a little too long, and there was something a little uncomfortable seeing such a young kid like that. While I'm talking about little touches of the film, I enjoyed the scene of Chichi attempting to defend Gohan, since her martial art prowess isn't something we've seen pretty much at all in DBZ or Super.My biggest complaints with the film mostly deal with the story - it's really nothing special outside of it's setting in the series timeline, and the way in which they deal with Garlic Jr, whilst fitting with events in the series overall, feels really anticlimatic and a real handwave to the threat he poses - but at the same time, Garlic Jr's early power-up really locked them in a corner on how he was going to be dealt with.Overall, Dead Zone is a great movie that just feels like a really good, extended episode of Dragon Ball Z. You really can't go wrong watching this if you're a Dragon Ball Z fan, though some of the comedy elements featuring Gohan break up the movie a bit and are just odd.

But for the most part, it's a great time, and highly recommended!"", ""Dragon Ball Z movie 1: Death Zone is a movie that can be watched before even starting Dragon Ball Z, but it requires finishing the original show if you want to know who the characters are.The story is about the son of the God of Earth's former rival Garlic Jr who wants revenge for his father's defeat and create a world for demons. To do that, he and his henchmen ambush Piccolo who is God's evil counterpart to indirectly eliminate him since the lives of God and Piccolo are connected. Because of circumstances, the main character's son has been kidnapped too.It is up to...Goku, Krillin and Piccolo to stop Garlic Jr and save Gohan.It is a simple story with a rather unique premise for Dragon Ball. This is the only Dragon Ball movie God is involved and one of rare accessions he is involved in combat. Not to mention, we get more insight about his past and Garlic Jr doesn't feel like an antagonist that came out of nowhere like many other Dragon Ball antagonist.Visually this movie strikes as unique since in terms of presentation it really feels like a movie and not like an extended episodes. Even the use of colors are unique for Dragon Ball which frequently uses bright colors such as blue and green and fights are in daytime. In this movie, they use more eerie colors like reddish orange for the sky and a more darker color pallett on the fighting stage and antagonists giving a more demonic or scary feel.Action and humor are Dragon Ball's bread and butter and Death Zone combines them well since it is the transitioning period between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, it can combine them excellently. Gohan is often used for the comic relief scenes but even in combat we see these when Goku fights Garlic Jr's henchmen which displays great use on weapons too which were useful back then.This movie is also the first time two characters who are enemies put their differences aside and work together. That being Goku and Piccolo showing how much of a threat Garlic Jr is that even the strongest characters up to this point have to work together.However there is some criticism. While many Dragon Ball Z movies don't fit the main story it doesn't hurt ignoring them or seeing them as what ifs. But if you want to watch Dragon Ball Z with filler and all, you are required to watch this movie since it will play a role in an arc of Dragon Ball Z. Meaning that not being able to explain the inconsistencies between anime series and film can be off putting since the characters meet Gohan in Z the first time but this movie can only work before watching Z in terms of fitting into the main story timeline of the anime adaptation of Dragon Ball.The last criticism is how the badguy is defeated because he is at fault mainly and another point might be considered a Deus Ex Machina which did get build up in the movie. But it isn't too bad when you watch or have watched Dragon Ball Z since it happens often and is someone's character trait that will get a payoff at some point.Overall this movie is good. Little short and lacks the transformations of the good guys many fans are hoping from Dragon Ball, and the main antagonist might not be that memorable, it still is an experience you will enjoy.

This is the only Dragon Ball movie God is involved and one of rare accessions he is involved in combat. Not to mention, we get more insight about his past and Garlic Jr doesn't feel like an antagonist that came out of nowhere like many other Dragon Ball antagonist.Visually this movie strikes as unique since in terms of presentation it really feels like a movie and not like an extended episodes. Even the use of colors are unique for Dragon Ball which frequently uses bright colors such as blue and green and fights are in daytime. In this movie, they use more eerie colors like reddish orange for the sky and a more darker color pallett on the fighting stage and antagonists giving a more demonic or scary feel.Action and humor are Dragon Ball's bread and butter and Death Zone combines them well since it is the transitioning period between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, it can combine them excellently. Gohan is often used for the comic relief scenes but even in combat we see these when Goku fights Garlic Jr's henchmen which displays great use on weapons too which were useful back then.This movie is also the first time two characters who are enemies put their differences aside and work together. That being Goku and Piccolo showing how much of a threat Garlic Jr is that even the strongest characters up to this point have to work together.However there is some criticism. While many Dragon Ball Z movies don't fit the main story it doesn't hurt ignoring them or seeing them as what ifs. But if you want to watch Dragon Ball Z with filler and all, you are required to watch this movie since it will play a role in an arc of Dragon Ball Z. Meaning that not being able to explain the inconsistencies between anime series and film can be off putting since the characters meet Gohan in Z the first time but this movie can only work before watching Z in terms of fitting into the main story timeline of the anime adaptation of Dragon Ball.The last criticism is how the badguy is defeated because he is at fault mainly and another point might be considered a Deus Ex Machina which did get build up in the movie. But it isn't too bad when you watch or have watched Dragon Ball Z since it happens often and is someone's character trait that will get a payoff at some point.Overall this movie is good. Little short and lacks the transformations of the good guys many fans are hoping from Dragon Ball, and the main antagonist might not be that memorable, it still is an experience you will enjoy."", 'Story:The story is pretty light-weight since the whole purpose of this film - and its subsequent movies - are all about giving us more reason to watch Goku punch stuff, but it\'s still engaging none-the-less. While the premise was interesting enough for me to keep watching, the risk factor was absent from the beginning. Having the main villain wish and receive immortality despite the fact that the villain is never shown in any other DBZ media immediately makes me comfortable knowing he losses in the end. I understand that that\'s how every single film is, considering it\'s all non-canon alt. universe stuff, but it still...matters when you\'re spending 45+ minutes watching something.Even so, I was still into it, especially since this was the first DBZ movie I had watched in years. I was hyped to finally start them since I finally reached their respective points in the manga (at least, where they WOULD be) and so it didn\'t really bother me that the plot was essentially ""Give me back my kid!"" And nothing more.The ending was quite anti-climactic for me solely because there isn\'t some awesome, choreographed fight, but a stand-off with a giant humanoid creature. This is somewhat repeated in a few other DBZ films and it\'s so boring to watch. I like seeing the DBZ heroes overcome their adversary with sheer force. If I want a cunning victory, have it be cunning with punches, I don\'t know. Maybe I\'m just being a baby about it but perhaps you can sympathize with the excitement of watching two macho guys - one good and one bad - going at it for real. I mean, this happens in the manga all the time and it rocks. Why not do it in a movie?Art:The animation is decent and I never found it bothersome. I recall a scene that used a previous shot but otherwise, everything was gucci.Sound:I watched the Funimation dub and, as is expected, it was quite enjoyable. I also found the soundtrack to be decent as most of the funimation dubs do away with the original OST (something I detest. Just alter the voices, not the music!)Character:Nothing particularly special about any of the characters in this film but I did enjoy that bit where Piccolo immediately wanted to fight Goku after they thought their troubles had vanished. I enjoy the little bits of in-world content that seep into these films that seem to reside outside of the canon universe. It makes sense that Piccolo would wanna jump at any opportunity to duel Goku once more. It\'s fun.Enjoyment:A solid entry but not necessary.

It strives into sickening detail of the euphoric feelings and vivid hallucinations Gohan surname gets from his regretful trips into intoxication land and makes me wish that I, myself, had just sculled 179 proof absinthe instead of watching it three times. Lord knows how many times I plopped myself down in front of the television and watched the VHS I once had when I was but a young sad ejaculate, but that's besides the point. Let's go through this review step by step.There's a...story to Dead Zone, sure. There is. There's a story to everything. There's a story of how I got up in the morning and scrolled through my list thinking I want to review something but I want it to be relatively niche and not very liked because if it isn't I will face the backlash of a thousand men, cascading down upon my back and splitting me open with their lashes. As would be the literal definition of backlash. But that wouldn't be very good, not really. Neither is the story to Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone. A blue midget comes from space and then kidnaps some dumb kid and uses him to become a god. The stuff of dreams.The older Dragon Ball Z art has a strange look to it that I kind of struggle to describe, really. It's unrefined. Everyone looks lankier than they do later on and it's a bit slower. I don't think I would jump at calling it bad but it's not good. It's passable.The sound design is up to par. There's a pretty good piss sound effect in this movie. It brought it up from a 5. He urinates on nobody in particulars bald shiny head because it was shiny enough to look like a toilet rim. They recoil in horror and it changes to urine splashing against a tiled floor. I liked it. It reminded me of me. I love me.The characters are strange in this movie and the only one you care about is Goku. I can tell. Goku feels kind of odd, like the art, as I previously addressed. He seems more like a violent maniac than he does in the actual show, where he's kind of a nice violentish maniac.It was an enjoyable enough film. I don't know if I would blatantly recommend it to anybody. It's canon status is arguable so it's not like you even need to acknowledge that it exists if you don't want to. If you should decide that the idea of a 4 foot something blue alien man becoming jacked as hell and then summoning a SATAN HOLE and afterwards remaining irrelevant for the actual show appeals to you you can watch it.

His saga didn't make sense to me then, and it doesn't make sense now.I decided I am gonna include Garlic jr. saga from DBZ as well into this review. To summarize, why this movie and saga aren't making any sense. Warning: Garlic saga does NOT have an impact on the rating of Dead ZoneIn the end, I'll give two ratings: One for the movie and the second for the entire saga.My positives and negatives from the DBZ movie: Dead...ZoneGarlic jr. is a non-canon character. Even though there was an effort to make Garlic canon, Junior and his saga remained non-canon.My positives:1, Art and Sound are in DBZ coat.2, Gohan little drunk session was humorous3, There's some story building.My neutrals:1, Fights were mediocre, not good, not bad.My negatives:1, After 300 years, someone will exact my revenge. Why 300 years? Garlic jr. has existed for more than 300 hundred years, and after Piccolo's father had been sealed away, and the earth was in a weak state, he could have killed Kami easily. Why did he wait 300 years for getting an eternal life when his crew collected dragon balls in a matter of few days? Plot.2, How did Kuririn get into Garlic castle? Did Piccolo bring him along?3, Garlic henchman defeat Piccolo with ease, only to be pushovers later.Now let's get into the Garlic jr. saga:1, Demon gets stronger 500 times is as stupid as it gets. Why does it even exist? Plot. To make post-Frieza Piccolo struggle, whoever wrote the script decided to make Garlic 500 times stronger ( 1 500 000 power) by a phenomenon. To be somewhat relevant. This is just stupid and lazy. Oh, and this phenomenon only occurs once in 5000 years, sure.2, Potion or gas that turns everyone evil, what? If such a thing existed why Piccolo's father didn't use it in DB 1986, his job would be way easier?Now to end, DBZ Movie: Dead Zone earns 5/10. It has some funny, and interesting scenes, but it lacks a good fight. Also, I can't get past Garlic waiting 300 years to collect dragon balls, which his crew collected with ease in a day or two. I recommend you to try it if you didn't already and you have finished DBZ because you'll get to know, where Garlic jr. came from.And now Garlic jr. saga, including Dead Zone, earns 3/10. It's just bad, and it should have never been occurring after the Frieza saga. Junior saga could have been decent if there weren't any stupid buffs, items. Also, it would suit the plot way better if it was between Raditz and Vegeta saga. ZoneGarlic jr. is a non-canon character.

While that doesn't mean it is a masterpiece, it means that the point of this movie is perfect in the context of the Dragonball franchise. The animation is stellar, superior to the regular series, the sound design is at the very peak of the era, and the inclusion of all the major characters having their own moment is a nice touch that adds to the characters role in the DBZ universe.However, the best aspect of this film is the way it seamlessly slides right...into the DBZ canon. Garlic Jr is a fantastic introduction as a villain, as a sort of suped up emperor pilaf type character, if Pilaf was less Slump-y in his gag presentation, he would be just like Garlic. While the movie doesn't do all that much in terms of plot, the introduction of Garlic into the DBZ universe is what directly leads up to one of the better, if not best, filler arcs in anime. In many ways, one cannot remove this movie from those episodes, as this serves more like a prequel to that arc.The most striking element of this is the incredible battle choreography. Better in many ways than all of the fights in the canon, the fights here are quite stunning, and utilize the space of the arena's incredibly well, with twists and turns due to the more cooperative nature of the battles here, unlike the main series. The same can be said for the overall animation quality, which is some of the best animation in the franchise.The major drawback is the lack of a defined story, but as I've stated, this serves as more of a prequel to the entire Garlic arc in the anime. Since it is filler, you cannot really expect any serious character development from the mains, as that would contradict the canon. into the DBZ canon.

', ""This first DBZ movie should be watched before you start watching Episode 108 of the DBZ series to understand the return of Garlic Jr.But is it really worth watching or only for die hard DBZ fans? I think its the latter.Sound & Art is on the level you'd expect from a DBZ Movie from that era although I would have prefered a slightly different opening. Even with some small changes it reminds too much of the series imo.The tension in this movie never reaches the same quality as the highlights from the series and the story is rather thin and never really builds excitement. Also...not much of a fan of the design from Antagonist Garlic Jr. Looks like a namekian Pilaf and his underlings are plain boring to me in design.Some funny but shallow jokes are thrown in for some humor.The climax fight in the end is rather untypical but mediocre at best.I think this movie is in a range around 5/10. Certainly not the highest quality I've seen. I wouldn't necessarily recommend to see it if you watch the normal series. not much of a fan of the design from Antagonist Garlic Jr. Looks like a namekian Pilaf and his underlings are plain boring to me in design.Some funny but shallow jokes are thrown in for some humor.The climax fight in the end is rather untypical but mediocre at best.I think this movie is in a range around 5/10.

I know the movies aren't exactly canon. And I'll be the first to admit that I'm not super well-versed in the timeline of when everything...first aired. But I figured Dead Zone would have had to take place before Raditz showed up, which would have made Goku and Piccolo teaming up a huge selling point. These days, it's kind of an afterthought that Piccolo was ever a villain. In that sense, Dead Zone definitely felt a little dated. It just didn't have the effect it was supposed to. And I personally, don't have much nostalgia for any of the DBZ movies. It was very familiar, so I'm sure I'd seen it sometime during my childhood... But it didn't have enough of an impact for me to really remember the way it first felt to see that truce.But in general, it was still perfectly enjoyable. Maybe a little mindlessly enjoyable, but I don't exactly look to the DBZ movies in search of something thought-provoking.

Yay?The story's about this blue little thing, who wants dragon balls. He and his minions kidnap Gohan, since they need just the dragon balls. The blue thing makes a wish with a dragon balls, the carrot cake and the Jolly Green wrinkle-brick show up, everybody yells and punches the air like spastic apes, this black hole appears, and the blue thing gets sucked. That's it.So... yeah. I saw it. I saw it, and I... huh? Then what? Honestly... what?! What! Well, I tell you, what!  A complete...waste of time, thats what! Seriously... I know I wasn't expecting anything at all, considering my utter and passionate disliking for this franchise, but to actually admitting that you're expecting nothing, and then get nothing, to surprise you... that just hurts! I know it's what I deserve, but still... it hurts! Alot! I would really like to be angry about this - considering the score - but... I just cant! It just isn't that... it is nothing! Nothing at all! This movie is... nothing! Nothing to be angry about, and nothing to be interested about! It just... came, and went... and is never, ever, coming back!When I first saw this movie as a parody, from TFS, I actually saw some blind, hopeful, yet short-lived potential, in it - how foolish of me! I tought, it was actually hilarious... kinda cool, actually - my tummy hurts, from all the laughing! So I found the original, and said... hey, it can't be all that bad - it's only 40 minutes long, thus hardly even a movie! What bad can it really do?! So I saw it, and... ended up skipping most of the entire movie, actually! Hups. But that can be justified, however, when there's not enough story, for even a full-length movie - 40 minutes of... bantering, at it's worst! - and the action is so tired, and bland, that I just skipped it, and welt like didn't miss a thing! Which I didn't! I could have fallen to sleep, and still could easily follow the... story, with ease! I mean, really... even for the DBZ-franchise, the premise is really, really boring, bland, and predictable! Some guy just wants some sweet juicy immortality, and take over the world - in this franchise, who even cares anymore?! Today it's Pilaf, tomorrow Piccolo, and next year, either Frieza, or Cell - pick your favourite now, before the lines are closed from the votes! And the villain himself, was so stupid, that even if he had the balls - no pun intented - to wish himself some sweet immortality, he was ultimately beaten, by his own stupidity! And rather easily, too! That's just... wow. Just... wow. It's not even meccha-Frieza level of disapointing anymore! It's just... I don't know! I've lost my words. Just... no. No!But, since my score is actually quite high, there must've been something good in this... piece of waste, right? Right! Well, as a matter of fact, there was - gasp! The art is actually a TONS of better, than the series - which isn't much, since the action... what little there is, happens mostly on blurmotion - and the voices, expecially Piccolos, are quite better too! Finally, Chris Sabat had his sexy voice right... and not like his trademark of a frog army! Anything else... no, not really! The premise is dull, as a butterknive... made out of paper, and the story is... wait, what story? There was a story?! Where?! Lemme see! Oh, right, Gohan... Gokus brat, becoming forcefully a apprentice, or something... and something about the world domination... destruction... solar system... apples that have drugs, to make this piece of piss enjoyable... or something, I don't know! Like I said, I skipped most of the movie, since absolutely nothing happened! Nothing! It literaly hurts me to realize, how little I just saw, compared to the vast superior parody! No witty dialogue, no interesting plot, nor story, no funny/clever/interesting/actual villain, and... Yeah, nothig, really. This movie is... nothing. It's just.. there! For the fans! Yay?This movie - seriously, is too short to be a movie! - with all it's artificial taste of a wet cardboard, mixed with some baby Gohans piss, drank by Krillin, is a prime example, of an anime, I like to call, a Candy without the Sugar- anime. It's nice to look at, but you don't want to put it in your mouth! The story's so paperthin, that there's really none at all - fitting, considering what I feel the franchise as a whole - and feels more like a two random  filler episodes, put forcefully together, than actual coherent story... which it isn't! The thrill isn't there, the threat's nonexistent, the world doesn't expand - not that it really needs to - and characters... well, they're there... all the same... as always... most of them, not actually doing anything at all. Just giving a fans a wave, and then... leaving... and staying gone... to let all the pointless bantering happen. Yay?So, all in all... what did I actually get, from watching this? Slight headache? Possible death sentance, from the fanboys? The TFS's parody? You know what... not too bad a deal! I'll take it! Anything else, than another try for this movie!

The story's so paperthin, that there's really none at all - fitting, considering what I feel the franchise as a whole - and feels more like a two random  filler episodes, put forcefully together, than actual coherent story... which it isn't! The thrill isn't there, the threat's nonexistent, the world doesn't expand - not that it really needs to - and characters... well, they're there... all the same... as always... most of them, not actually doing anything at all. Just giving a fans a wave, and then... leaving... and staying gone... to let all the pointless bantering happen. Yay?So, all in all... what did I actually get, from watching this? Slight headache? Possible death sentance, from the fanboys? The TFS's parody? You know what... not too bad a deal! I'll take it! Anything else, than another try for this movie!

First of all the movie was way too short for the events happening in there like there was so much room for more. Second of all the movie is a typical non-canon anime movie so pretty much nothing special. Like you see some events in DBZ and wonder: But that already happened in the movie so why is Son Goku surprised? Third of all the movie didn't really explain the new character (Garlic Jr.). He just appeared out of nowhere kidnapping Son Gohan and then a little 1 minute backstory about Garlic Jr. Including... literally nothing about him in it....So the movie was pretty bad in my eyes.

Sure, the story has problems and inevitably is just backstory for a filler arc, the first 10 or so minutes don’t matter really at all, and Krillian, piccolo, and Kami all just kind...of show up without a lot of reason to fight Garlic Jr. They are real and can be considered legitimate problems with this film.But through and through this movie is a short and fun 420 romp. You get good action, minor psychadelic visuals (in meaningless first few minutes I mentioned), and a story you really don’t need to think all that hard about.This movie is NOT going to fundamentally shift how you view dragon ball, but is well worth the short 40 minute run time. It’s especially valuable if you watch it in line with dragon ball z, as it’s one of the only movies with tangible reference in the show. of show up without a lot of reason to fight Garlic Jr. They are real and can be considered legitimate problems with this film.But through and through this movie is a short and fun 420 romp.

It\'s barely the length of two TV episodes, and so the thing is a breezy blast. If it were even ten minutes longer, the whole thing would fall apart, but instead it\'s a fairly enjoyable experience.I\'m not going to explain the plot because it\'s just some ""powered up dude gotta get beat up"" excuse. All you have to know is that the entire second half of the movie is a big fight scene and it\'s...great. The villains are silly, and there\'s constant inappropriate jokes and violent gags (Gohan, four years old, gets drunk and goes on a head trip dancing with a dinosaur). This is all you needed.You certainly won\'t remember it well, but it\'s a whole lot better than the typical anime tie-in movie, mostly because it didn\'t have time to ruin itself. Plus. this is I believe the one and only time we get to see Chi-Chi in a fight scene, even if it\'s only for a moment.Also, from what I recall, all of these Dragon Ball movies takes place in some weird side-reality from the rest of the TV series, because almost none of them could actually feasibly fit in the timeline due to various egregious plot holes.

As such, it seems appropriate to talk about the first film that moved over to the Dragonball Z label, 1989's Dead Zone. Let's get right to it.Story:We open with Piccolo being attacked by a trio of strange looking guys. These are the demons Ginger, Nicky & Sansho. They're out to kill Kami and collect the dragonballs so that their master, Garlic Jr, can wish for immortality. And every fan of the franchise has already identified the problem with their plan. Any way, they kidnap Gohan because his hat has...a dragonball on it thereby dragging Goku into the fight.Let's start with the obvious problem. These villains are stupid. Like, inexcusably stupid. To start with, if they managed to kill Piccolo, the dragonballs would stop working. Secondly, why are they targeting Piccolo to kill Kami? Yes, the two are connected but why are they attacking the younger, more powerful one instead of the elderly, much weaker one? Third, why are they kidnapping Gohan? Literally, all they have to do is take his hat and leave. Yeah, Goku could still follow them using the dragon radar but he also has a lot less incentive to do it when his son isn't in danger. Besides, they don't gain anything from taking the kid. There is one other thing during the climax that a lot of fans view as a stupid move, but I see it as more of a desperate act on Jr's part to deal with two powerful opponents so that they can't cripple him since being immortal doesn't make you impervious to permanent injuries.On the positive side, this is a Dragonball Z film and most people who watch it aren't going to care if the antagonists are morons. They're going to want to see some strong action sequences and maybe some funny moments. Which the film does have. So, franchise fans will likely be pretty satisfied with it.Characters:The major protagonists are Goku, Piccolo and Gohan with Krillin providing support. Which is a pretty common lineup for Dragonball Z films that predate Vegeta's redemption. The villains in this are kind of weak. Just because they are clods and they don't have much screen time. Which is also pretty common for the henchmen in Dragonball films.Art:The film does look good. And the designs are well done. I do appreciate that Garlic Jr looks like an imp from Chrono Trigger. Though this came out first, so I should be saying that the imps look like Garlic Jr. But I think the important aspect for fans of the franchise is going to be that the action sequences are nicely done. That being said, they definitely could have been better. Every battle in this feels like it could have benefited from a little more time and not time spent shouting to get stronger. Time spent actually throwing punches, kicks and energy blasts.Sound:I've already talked about the actors for the main protagonists before. They're still good in their roles. As for the antagonists, they're voiced by Kamiya Akira, Totani Kouji (who also had a minor role as a vampire in Dragonball), Chiba Shigeru (the voice of Pilaf), & Hori Yukitoshi. All of them do decently in their roles. The music is pretty much the same as you get in the series. Right down to Cha La Head Cha La as the theme tune. Which isn't a bad thing, Dragonball Z has good music.Ho-yay:There is none.Areas of Improvement:1. Do a better job of matching the antagonists motivations to their actions. You can do better than Marvel does with Mr. Sinister.2. Use a bit more time to develop your scenario. I know, the Dragonball franchise isn't known for its strong plots. But you could still use a little more time to expand on the scenario.3. More time for the battles.Final Thoughts:There are two big flaws with this film. The first is that the villains are just moronic. The second is that everything is a bit rushed from the plotting to the battles. That being said, if you're a fan of the Dragonball franchise and you want something quick to watch, it should do fine for you. I'm giving it a 6/10.

Fate/Prototype,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12565/Fate_Prototype,"[""This is basically what Fate/staynight could have been. The format is kind of similar to a trailer.First of all, the animation is absolutely fantastic, and the soundtrack isn't bad either.In this version of the Holy Grail War, the main character is instead a girl called Ayaka, whose family was involved in the previous war. She doesn't want to get involved in the present war (apparently they take place every 8 years now). However, she gets attacked by Lancer, and ends up summoning Saber. Who is male.The rest of the OVA is composed of really quick flashes of scenes and battles. It's confusing to watch, and...I had to go search online for more info about the characters and such in order to fully understand the OVA. There are many battle scenes in the OVA, and they all seem to be really epic. Special mention goes to Gilgamesh's new powers.The characters are similar to Fate/staynight, given that this was the prototype for Staynight. The Servants have been slightly redesigned, including making Saber male. The protagonist Ayaka seems to be the generic scared & shy girl type, but then again the OVA didn't really give much time to develop anything. During the quick flashes, we get a glimpse at the villlains, all of which seem to be very interesting.The character who stood out to me blonde girl at the very end who seems to be yandere for male!Saber. Later online searches tell me she is named Manaka, and she's actually Ayaka's sister and a main villan. She feels kind of like Illya to me.Overall, I think this was a really cool concept. I really wish the OVA was longer, as a few searches online gave me some really interesting information that I didn't catch during the quick flashes.

This trailer shows Kinoko Nasu\'s original version of the Holy Grail War, which Nasu later re-worked into what we all know as Fate/Stay Night.Shirou from the original is now a girl named Ayaka Sajyou, and servant Saber is a man (same hero though). There are many commonalities rules-wise towards how the Holy Grail War works, with the main differences being that in this version, the War takes place every 8 years; also,...there is a whole new tiered system of masters, which follows the angelic hierarchy (there is more to it, but it was not really possible to fully explain it in a 12 minute trailer).The art in this trailer is actually fairly good, and the short flashes of fight scenes, mostly between Saber and Archer, look great. The character designs are obviously nice and unique, exactly what you would expect from Nasu. There are a lot of similarities character-wise between Fate/Prototype and Fate/Stay Night, and a fan can instantly see how different characters here (like the crazy priest) were re-imagined in F/SN (Kotomine Kirei).The only criticism I can give is that the MC looks quite generic - nothing more than a typical, shy, insecure school-girl, at least judging from this short preview.There really is not too much to say about this one, since it is so short. 12 minutes long preview of a project of such proportions do not do it justice. It is confusing, jumps from one thing to another every 10 seconds, but I suppose that is exactly what you would expect from a trailer.Overall, I can sat that the Fate/Prototype trailer is quite enjoyable and it led me to take quite an interest in the Fate/Prototype universe. There is a lot more to read about it online and a whole prequel-LN series named ""Fate/Prototype: Fragments of Sky Silver"". So if you have some time, give this short preview a try, especially if you are a big fan of Nasuverse. One warning though - if you have never seen or read anything to do with Fate, you will most likely not understand or appreciate this. there is a whole new tiered system of masters, which follows the angelic hierarchy (there is more to it, but it was not really possible to fully explain it in a 12 minute trailer).The art in this trailer is actually fairly good, and the short flashes of fight scenes, mostly between Saber and Archer, look great.

Gasaraki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/782/Gasaraki,"['Where Evangelion revolutionised the mecha genre, and perhaps inspired melodramatic experimentalism in modern anime, Gasaraki made a quieter step in a different direction for mecha. From the very outset, I&rsquo;ll just say that one of the main draw points for this series is the mecha design, and the high degree of thought that was put into the functionality of the bipedal machines as effective tools of war in near-future combat. But there is a lot more to the show than that; Gasaraki is one of those rare anime that manage to rise above what could easily have become a convoluted mess of a plot. With...elements of military, romance, supernatural, sci-fi, mecha, history, and politics, Gasaraki is the product of an amalgamation of a whole slew of genres and plot-lines that manages to work. But it doesn&rsquo;t work as well as it could have, and the constant juggling of its many characters and stories result in some elements being underplayed and others over-stressed. The character of Misuzu and her endearment to her brother seems to be almost completely redundant at times, and quite often you end up wishing one storyline was given more attention than others. But the hectic plot also means that the show manages to be engaging for the majority of its run without ever resorting to an episodic format, which is a bit of a rarity in anime. One of the show&rsquo;s biggest flaws is its characterisation, largely in the first half of the series.The series has a very large cast, and as such, it struggles early on in giving any one character enough attention to establish them as a believable, human individual. For far too long, the protagonists of the series are sidelined to a seemingly inconsequential role of feeling sorry for themselves, and most of the rest of the cast are like talking clich&eacute;s. This results in a disappointing, flat beginning. But the show does eventually manage to pull in the viewers when things start to come together and the characters are faced with hardship after hardship, the way they handle each obstacle a contribution to their depth of character. By the end of the series I felt a strong affection for many of the characters, and the villains prove to be very satisfying in their antagonistic roles, with Gouda-esque scheming and cunning. The almost iconic Nishida was one of the more interesting characters, a tactical genius and a man of honour and strong values, he provided the backbone for the idealistic elements of the series. Unfortunately, Miharu is never quite granted enough development to make her anything beyond blatantly sympathetic, and Yushiro is often terminally quiet. The more outgoing members of the TA crew proved to be the best source of characterisation from the whole show.I&rsquo;m not usually a fan of mecha at all, in fact the mere concept of creating bipedal weapons that dwarf other combatants or transform into jets is just impractical. A man-made bipedal weaponry would not only be incredibly hard and costly to create (just look at how long it took them to get ASIMO waddling about), but it would serve no purpose, having no benefit over existing vehicles of war such as tanks and aircraft. Not to mention, hominoid designs for mecha are only possible to a certain height, whereupon the sheer weight of the mecha would cause its legs and joints to crumble. Gasaraki, however, is the one and only mecha anime where the mecha is both feasible and logically designed. Rather than trying to sell them as useful all-purpose weapons, the &ldquo;Tactical Armours&rdquo; or TAs, are portrayed as being optimised for urban combat, where the mobility of tanks is severely limited. They are not oversized, instead built with a stock frame that is able to hold a large array of equipment, ammunition and some missiles. The thought that was put into them is quite impressive, exemplified by the fact that they, realistically, are not flawless super-powered machines. In one of the earlier episodes, for instance, the functionality of the TAs are severely impaired by sand getting into their systems when they enter combat in a desert area. Also, the piloting of a TA is shown to be quite a taxing experience, with the use of drugs to manipulate the pilot&rsquo;s physical condition being a common occurrence (quite an adept foresight into the direction of warfare). In combat, their mobility is significantly better than alternative vehicles (especially as they are able to hoist themselves up the sides of buildings), but they are not overly dextrous or agile. This down-to-earth, believable portrayal of mecha is something I hadn&rsquo;t seen done before (or since), and so I give the show credit for its pioneering mecha conception.However, with that appraisal out of the way, the fact that they are more realistic also means that the action scenes are often slightly subdued and slow, not as exciting as the fast-paced fisticuffs of your usual clich&eacute;d mecha. There are a number of action highlights, such as Symbol&rsquo;s TAs taking out a unit of tanks in Belgistan, and the battle following the awakening of the Kugutsu, but all in all, the action scenes are relatively bland, and sometimes the animation budget clearly isn&rsquo;t there to support them (such as when the rioting takes place later in the series). A few times, they are made more interesting by the ingenious use of the TAs many functions to escape a tight situation. The show maintains a relatively fast pace right the way through, so it isn&rsquo;t lacking in excitement, but don&rsquo;t expect to be blown away with intense action sequences. On the whole, the production values get the job done but do not excel. The character designs are different, but, with the exclusion of the Gowa family, also uite unappealing. There are a number of reused cels and shortcuts in the animation are apparent at times. The music, on the other hand, is remarkable, with an ethereal clash of archaic Japanese and modern, militaristic sounds. This melding of sounds is exemplified best by the OP, which I consider a musical accomplishment, and quite possibly my favourite anime OP ever. The soundtrack is fittingly haunting and refreshingly innovative.So, where the characters and the production are the sources of most of the show&rsquo;s flaws, the plot is an understated success, crafting a complex mythos for the gasaraki, as well as deftly utilising the global economy as the stage for a truly modernistic conflict. The way the series balances, or rather, collides the old and the new through its exploration of multiple timelines, one set in archaic Japan and the other in the near-future, is clever and engaging. It mirrors the thematic core of the series, which is all about the conflict between traditional and modern values, and the resultant direction of human civilisation. I especially love the story behind the Gasaraki, and their plight was a nice way to cap off the themes of the show in a thought-provoking manner. I will also attest to the fact that Gasaraki truly nails the fragile balance between mystery and explanation; where many anime leave frustrating plotholes, Gasaraki leaves a hazy sense of unknown which compliments the new-age mythical tone of the show. It helps that I&rsquo;m a great fan of political espionage and conspiracy, as a good portion of the show is spent scheming and plotting, as well as exposition interestingly delivered through news reports. There is a lot of dialogue, and the story is quite involved, so it&rsquo;s not a show you can casually skip through. That&rsquo;s not to say it becomes bogged down in pointless dialogue; there should be enough going on to keep anyone interested.All in all, Gasaraki is a series that should be applauded for trying something new and interesting with the mecha genre, and for the amount of thought that went into its complex story, but is one that failed to live up to its potential through unexceptional production and often poorly written characters. It&rsquo;s a series that will be highly enjoyed by anyone with the fortitude to watch past its opening episodes, and for anyone who really appreciates innovation and a creative story. Those who simply must have strong dramatic elements to their anime, or who are likely to be apathetic toward the cool mecha designs may find the show very disappointing. In any case, its milestone treatment of mecha as more than a fanciful superweapon, is one that no other anime has put in the effort to match, and its plot is several cuts above the clich&eacute; that plagues the mecha genre. elements of military, romance, supernatural, sci-fi, mecha, history, and politics, Gasaraki is the product of an amalgamation of a whole slew of genres and plot-lines that manages to work. But it doesn&rsquo;t work as well as it could have, and the constant juggling of its many characters and stories result in some elements being underplayed and others over-stressed. The character of Misuzu and her endearment to her brother seems to be almost completely redundant at times, and quite often you end up wishing one storyline was given more attention than others. But the hectic plot also means that the show manages to be engaging for the majority of its run without ever resorting to an episodic format, which is a bit of a rarity in anime. One of the show&rsquo;s biggest flaws is its characterisation, largely in the first half of the series.The series has a very large cast, and as such, it struggles early on in giving any one character enough attention to establish them as a believable, human individual. For far too long, the protagonists of the series are sidelined to a seemingly inconsequential role of feeling sorry for themselves, and most of the rest of the cast are like talking clich&eacute;s. This results in a disappointing, flat beginning. But the show does eventually manage to pull in the viewers when things start to come together and the characters are faced with hardship after hardship, the way they handle each obstacle a contribution to their depth of character. By the end of the series I felt a strong affection for many of the characters, and the villains prove to be very satisfying in their antagonistic roles, with Gouda-esque scheming and cunning. The almost iconic Nishida was one of the more interesting characters, a tactical genius and a man of honour and strong values, he provided the backbone for the idealistic elements of the series. Unfortunately, Miharu is never quite granted enough development to make her anything beyond blatantly sympathetic, and Yushiro is often terminally quiet. The more outgoing members of the TA crew proved to be the best source of characterisation from the whole show.I&rsquo;m not usually a fan of mecha at all, in fact the mere concept of creating bipedal weapons that dwarf other combatants or transform into jets is just impractical. A man-made bipedal weaponry would not only be incredibly hard and costly to create (just look at how long it took them to get ASIMO waddling about), but it would serve no purpose, having no benefit over existing vehicles of war such as tanks and aircraft. Not to mention, hominoid designs for mecha are only possible to a certain height, whereupon the sheer weight of the mecha would cause its legs and joints to crumble. Gasaraki, however, is the one and only mecha anime where the mecha is both feasible and logically designed. Rather than trying to sell them as useful all-purpose weapons, the &ldquo;Tactical Armours&rdquo; or TAs, are portrayed as being optimised for urban combat, where the mobility of tanks is severely limited. They are not oversized, instead built with a stock frame that is able to hold a large array of equipment, ammunition and some missiles. The thought that was put into them is quite impressive, exemplified by the fact that they, realistically, are not flawless super-powered machines. In one of the earlier episodes, for instance, the functionality of the TAs are severely impaired by sand getting into their systems when they enter combat in a desert area. Also, the piloting of a TA is shown to be quite a taxing experience, with the use of drugs to manipulate the pilot&rsquo;s physical condition being a common occurrence (quite an adept foresight into the direction of warfare). In combat, their mobility is significantly better than alternative vehicles (especially as they are able to hoist themselves up the sides of buildings), but they are not overly dextrous or agile.

However, it makes sense that such a heady series wouldn't win over the hearts of wide-eyed mecha anime consumers who expect fight scenes to actually be mech fight scenes, and not the economic and diplomatic warfare that takes precedent in this anime. The attitude as expressed by raters here on MAL parallels the tension that defines the main theme of the series: the eternal and (probably) identical movement of progress and destruction.Gasaraki takes place in a not-so-distant sci-fi future. Illegal immigration is a (seemingly) huge problem in Japan...due to the effects of globalist economics, which has built up the illusion of economic superiority in developed, globalist economies. On the minds of the Japanese people (or so we're told) is the desire for consumption, luxury, and the satisfaction of immediate desires. The interconnected international community, of course, is highly sensitive to huge changes, and an upstart in the Middle East (where else?) has created a problem that needs to be taken care of by all those with interests in keeping the Progress moving.Enter the TAs. What better way to show-off your cool new mechs than going to the Middle East and hopefully (but is it really even necessary?) kick some ass. The first thing that one will take note of is the incredibly realistic mech designs. Their grittiness perfectly fits in to the muted, militaristic color tones present throughout the series' design. A design that even extends into the past (hey, it fits into the theme!)The mechs (TAs) themselves aren't really the main focus in the grand scheme of things, although you'll get a nice bit of detail into how they work, and it's great that they're realistic enough that it seems probably that they could work as portrayed. Instead, we have the spotlight shining on a whole mess of characters. Like the TAs, we get a sense that most of these people are simply cogs in a political/militaristic machine, that has been turning for centuries. There are those, it seems, that can gain control of this machine (the 'terror' ?) and our main character Yuushirou is one who has the ability to control some crazy thing in order to get closer to that power.Of course, with a power like that, who wouldn't want to use him as a means to their end? His own powerful family isn't going to sit by and let someone else harness his ability, so they do what they're supposed to do, be 'mean' to him...In my opinion this anime shines in its literal discussion (not just exploration) of themes that define the will of human beings to take control of themselves, create civilization, and steer its progress. Therefore, it t is no surprise that politics and the military play such an important role in the anime because it is through these channels that modern man is able to accomplish change. The narrative mirrors this in a way I can only describe as ingenious: the content of the narrative becomes the movement of the narrative itself.What we see happening on the micro level (this story) has been occurring in a much grander scale throughout all of human history.So, what is it that Gasaraki is trying to say? Up until the very end there doesn't seem to be any overarching morality that the show is trying to espouse. Instead we have individuals ompeting to force their own vision onto the whole of human civilization. And at the end, well it's something....Something I find most interesting is the portrayal of the TAs/kugai as vessels which contain the gods humans want to keep closest to them. Those gods really being a certain ambition within us all. That these vessels, in both instances, would also be weapons is quite telling. (see also: swords)One of the individuals I find most interesting is Nishida, a scholar with the hope of rejecting the progress that has been made and instead descend into a more pure and idealized system. Another is the eldest (?) Gowa brother who does the opposite. The focus is on these big-shots , regulating even our main characters to the level of small-timers. This dichotomy between the big-shots and the small-fries becomes an important part of the series. Big-shots hope to shape the world with their ideals, become fate, while small-fries simply want to see fate as something not etched in stone but forever changing, and live their lives according to their own  much smaller and more ephemeral dreams. This difference of perspective is really the only way we can gauge good vs evil, for the most part what is right and wrong gets lost in the force of those attempting to control the narrative. That our main characters struggle with one perspective, may be a clue as to the moral direction this series wants to take.In terms of thematic content we have: the TA/kugai, pilot/kai parallel, the theater stage and the stage of fate, the eternal conflicts of civilizations and the eternal conflicts of ideas, chaos on the small and grand scale, mortality and immortality, human-ness and anti-human-ness, progress that leads to destruction and the destruction that leads to progress, the sapling that grows among the rubble and the husk that topples under its own weight, the personification of history/fate, the oppressiveness of fate and the rejection of fate, human monkey-ness and human being-ness..and many more.The anime is also executed well. I think the direction, pacing is spot on. Opening and ending themes are incredible.Gasaraki is a slow-moving, dialogue-heavy, dark, and realistic anime that asks some of the most important and relevant questions about ourselves and our desires as human beings, especially of those human beings who have power over all others.

A god worries not over the cries of individual men. He must be detached, disinterested. That is why I can move this world."" - Kazukiyo GowaAt long last, my journey through anime inspired by (or directly ripping off) Evangelion continues with Gasaraki- an original Sunrise anime produced by Ryosuke Takahashi (creator of Blue Gender, assistant directed Ruroni Kenshin and has worked on many Sunrise mecha shows) and Gorou Taniguchi, who would later create and direct a little anime known as...Code Geass.Let me start by saying that Gasaraki is not for the every-man anime watcher. The show is a dense sociopolitical drama, drenched in hard science fiction and with an added spice of some ancient Japanese traditionalism and mythology. This may sound a rather strange assortment of themes, but through careful navigation of them, it makes a complete product that I found to be quite enjoyable. The cast of Gasaraki is quite large, given that there are multiple military, government, and civilian factions, all working against each other- so learning the names and getting intimate characterization is largely pushed to the wayside through the first half or so. However, as the plot thickens, the importance of a smaller group of characters is distilled, and they\'re able to develop beyond feeling sorry for themselves and throwing pity parties every other episode.The basic plot is that Yushiro Gowa, a nearly mindless, slavish, young man who\'s pushed into military service by his incredibly wealthy and politically powerful family for the purpose of testing a new armament for the Japanese military- is used and abused for the advancement of this new technology. These prototype Tactical Armors (bipedal war machines designed for urban combat, in places that tanks and warplanes would be at a severe disadvantage) are produced by the Gowa family (based on ancient war machines used in Feudal Japan, that were like enormous, living samurai) in an attempt to garner more political power by ingratiating themselves to the government with their new weapons. Little does the government know, Kazukiyo Gowa, the eldest of the family of 5- 4 brothers, including Yushiro, and a teenage sister- Misuzu (played by the excellent Hilary Haag) has a plan to upend the Japanese government, and become a puppeteer from the shadows in an egomaniacal quest for power.What ensues is a complex, realistic drama of economic manipulation of the stock market and commodities to cause panic and trigger an invasion of Japan by the US under the guise of a terrorist attack to ensure that the Japanese government does not withdraw its assets from global markets, causing a severe depression and crashing other economies worldwide. Kazukiyo intends to use this as his golden ticket to catapult himself and the handful of his assembled idealistic and coldly passionate individuals into the heart of the Japanese government and world economy.Kazukiyo is the embodiment of a completely realistic, lawful evil character.-something that is extraordinarily rare in anime, and by far the most interesting character. To me, his machinations were the most intriguing and exciting thing about the show- how he managed to manipulate the government, military, and became so detached from humanity that he would find his own family as disposable as yesterday\'s trash in order to gain power.What\'s interesting about Gasaraki is that for having some top-billed cast members like Chris Patton (Yushiro) and Monica Rial (Miharu) as the two main characters- they have probably the least number of lines in the entire show, and are probably the least interesting characters overall as well, which was honestly, a waste of their talents. Once Yushiro and Miharu find some purpose in life though, their characters finally work their way out of the dreary, drab colors they\'re rendered in, and feel a bit more alive, but this is in the very final act of the show, unfortunately. However, I found Andy McAvin\'s Oeufcoque, Mardock Scramble) performance nearly mesmerizing in his delivery of the snakelike, ambitious, and sociopathic role of the eldest brother Kazukiyo Gowa. This dub was done by ADV- and is a very solid piece of work with a good handful of well known voice actors, but anchored by outstanding performances by the supporting cast.The other, possibly most important part about Gasaraki, is how much effort went into the design of the mechs and the backdrop against which the plot is set. The story begins in Belgistan, an oil rich middle eastern country headed by a not so benevolent dictator who looks and acts nothing like Saddam Hussein, with the introduction of the aforementioned TA\'s (Tactical Armor). Unlike anything the world has ever seen- the conniving Gowa family has, unbeknownst the world, produced a bipedal tank replacement that is far superior in urban combat, and has been selling them to this dictator. When the NATO forces invade Belgistan to topple the regime, not at all like Desert Storm, they are summarily defeated by these new mechanical monstrosities- which triggers interest in them by the world\'s governments.The TA\'s are designed modularly- with each limb and torso part being replaceable if damaged- and having many types of armaments available for attachment, easily changed out, unlike tanks. They\'re also capable of climbing, with the usage of two launchable grappling hooks and angled jet propulsion systems on the legs and chest to enable them to clamber up concrete/rock structures, like buildings without horribly damaging or toppling them. Each TA is piloted by a single soldier, who is hooked up to an array of medical equipment and can be injected with different compounds to increase reaction rates, be awoken from an unconscious state, or to ease pain due to combat, all in order to increase effectiveness. These are not completely infallible killing machines, as many mecha anime would have you believe however. In the desert sand, several of the TA\'s are damaged by the gritty dust getting into the actuators- and later, in the swamp, a pair of them sink. Given that they\'re on legs, they can also be damaged and rendered nearly useless if they are removed. In short, they\'re very functionally designed, but have the same drawbacks that a walking tank would have in real life. Great thought was put into the lore behind the design of these- which I appreciated.If one has seen Code Geass, they can also spot many similarities to the knightmare frames- which draw direct influence from Gasaraki\'s TA\'s.Since I\'ve been rambling on way too long here, I\'ll wrap this up quickly with the animation and final comments: the animation is average at best. It\'s easy to tell that this show did not have a great budget, even in 1998- but it\'s never so awful that it\'s unwatchable, though there are a few moments where frames are reused and a good amount of stillframe while people are talking or sitting in a room is used- but it doesn\'t hamper the overall experience too much. The music is quite good, though- with a good composition of orchestral themes and a mix of traditional Japanese music thrown in when appropriate.The worst part about the show is probably the underutilized main characters (and their voice actors)- but otherwise it\'s a very mature, complex, and well thought out political/war drama that is a rarity in anime for how realistically it was put together, and how grounded it stays throughout. The first half is quite slow, but it picks up a fair amount in the second act.Final rating: 7.5""If human feelings are what must be sacrificed to become a god, then I would rather remain humbled by sorrow!"" -Yushiro Gowa Code Geass.Let me start by saying that Gasaraki is not for the every-man anime watcher.

The story begins in Belgistan, an oil rich middle eastern country headed by a not so benevolent dictator who looks and acts nothing like Saddam Hussein, with the introduction of the aforementioned TA\'s (Tactical Armor). Unlike anything the world has ever seen- the conniving Gowa family has, unbeknownst the world, produced a bipedal tank replacement that is far superior in urban combat, and has been selling them to this dictator. When the NATO forces invade Belgistan to topple the regime, not at all like Desert Storm, they are summarily defeated by these new mechanical monstrosities- which triggers interest in them by the world\'s governments.The TA\'s are designed modularly- with each limb and torso part being replaceable if damaged- and having many types of armaments available for attachment, easily changed out, unlike tanks. They\'re also capable of climbing, with the usage of two launchable grappling hooks and angled jet propulsion systems on the legs and chest to enable them to clamber up concrete/rock structures, like buildings without horribly damaging or toppling them. Each TA is piloted by a single soldier, who is hooked up to an array of medical equipment and can be injected with different compounds to increase reaction rates, be awoken from an unconscious state, or to ease pain due to combat, all in order to increase effectiveness. These are not completely infallible killing machines, as many mecha anime would have you believe however. In the desert sand, several of the TA\'s are damaged by the gritty dust getting into the actuators- and later, in the swamp, a pair of them sink. Given that they\'re on legs, they can also be damaged and rendered nearly useless if they are removed. In short, they\'re very functionally designed, but have the same drawbacks that a walking tank would have in real life. Great thought was put into the lore behind the design of these- which I appreciated.If one has seen Code Geass, they can also spot many similarities to the knightmare frames- which draw direct influence from Gasaraki\'s TA\'s.Since I\'ve been rambling on way too long here, I\'ll wrap this up quickly with the animation and final comments: the animation is average at best. It\'s easy to tell that this show did not have a great budget, even in 1998- but it\'s never so awful that it\'s unwatchable, though there are a few moments where frames are reused and a good amount of stillframe while people are talking or sitting in a room is used- but it doesn\'t hamper the overall experience too much. The music is quite good, though- with a good composition of orchestral themes and a mix of traditional Japanese music thrown in when appropriate.The worst part about the show is probably the underutilized main characters (and their voice actors)- but otherwise it\'s a very mature, complex, and well thought out political/war drama that is a rarity in anime for how realistically it was put together, and how grounded it stays throughout. The first half is quite slow, but it picks up a fair amount in the second act.Final rating: 7.5""If human feelings are what must be sacrificed to become a god, then I would rather remain humbled by sorrow!"" -Yushiro Gowa', 'Out of all the anime I\'ve seen over the years that fall in and around the mecha genre, Gasaraki definitely has one thing going for it: Style.The show is a fusion of unlikely elements: Gritty mechanized warfare that\'s so real it\'s almost boring with its endless chatter about maintenance and data collection. Elaborately costumed and choreographed traditional performing arts. Classical Japanese history. War in the Middle East. Trans-Pacific diplomacy.Somehow Sunrise manages to fit all these individual pieces together into a nice-looking whole with a muted but satisfying color palette, consistent but not-too-formulaic episode pacing, and well selected musical choices that compliment the military and spiritual...aspects of the show equally well, creating this harmonious whole that mecha fanatics can\'t help but lose themselves in if they\'re not trying to follow the story too closely.Unfortunately, if a person does try to follow along with the nebulous twists and turns of Gasaraki\'s storyline, major flaws become apparent that seriously detract from the brownie points the series collects on style: While Gasaraki does manage to stitch all the genres and tropes I mentioned above into one cloth that\'s largely believable, fitting that many elements into 25 episodes forces the plot to weave all over the road as far as the characters\' motivations are concerned, and leave you a little dazed at the end wondering what the purpose of all the warfare was supposed to be from the beginning.SPOILERS THIS PARAGRAPH: Yushiro started out the series as some kind of spiritual medium who could perform the dance of Gasaraki for Gowa. Then he also turned out to be the lead test pilot for Gowa\'s state-of-the-art mobile weapons program. Then these other mobile weapons appear in Belgistan (making Gowa no longer state-of-the-art?), and Yushiro goes there and meets Miharu, which in a roundabout way reveals that he is both a 1000-year-old reincarnated soul AND not the real Yushiro Gowa. Then, while Yushiro and Miharu are AWOL from their respective militias to ""find themselves"" in Kyoto, and hear the story of the kai and kugai from a man who\'s just conveniently waiting there for them, the JSSDF randomly decides that the Japanese population needs to be purged of modern materialistic greed (and taking the United States down with it?) provoking Miharu\'s former comrades to attack Gowa/JSSDF headquarters so Yushiro can return from Kyoto right in the nick of time and save the day?It reminds of a Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle in a way, with reincarnated clones coming back from the dead to have incest babies that will eventually challenge their own incest parents to a duel to the death in another dimension in the future.

Is it possible that even Gasaraki\'s own writers had lost track of what was going on by the last episode?After finishing the first four episodes of Gasaraki, I had really high hopes for where the end of the series was going to go. I really thought it was going to turn out like Evangelion, or Lain, or xxxHolic, and have some kind of deep-but-vague conclusion that I could kick back and think about for a while. I kept suspending judgment as I watched one episode after the next, holding out hope, waiting for the end when something unexpected would happen that would tie everything together and make it all make sense... But that validating moment never came, and there was just massive disappointment waiting for me as the power of the Gasaraki faded away leaving Yushiro and Miharu smilingly gazing into the sunrise with all their friends, like the end of some fluffy Pixar movie, so easily seeming to forget everything that happened to them in the last 24 episodes. aspects of the show equally well, creating this harmonious whole that mecha fanatics can\'t help but lose themselves in if they\'re not trying to follow the story too closely.Unfortunately, if a person does try to follow along with the nebulous twists and turns of Gasaraki\'s storyline, major flaws become apparent that seriously detract from the brownie points the series collects on style: While Gasaraki does manage to stitch all the genres and tropes I mentioned above into one cloth that\'s largely believable, fitting that many elements into 25 episodes forces the plot to weave all over the road as far as the characters\' motivations are concerned, and leave you a little dazed at the end wondering what the purpose of all the warfare was supposed to be from the beginning.SPOILERS THIS PARAGRAPH: Yushiro started out the series as some kind of spiritual medium who could perform the dance of Gasaraki for Gowa.

It's highly thoughtful and insightful into the relationships of large political families. When watching this anime, I think it's vitally important to go read up on the importance of the Noh play in Japan and what it actually MEANS. You will not be able to fully appreciate this series without having an appreciation of Noh (and wikipedia's article is totally insufficient to get this appreciation - I suggest a  trip to your local library for a breifing of Japanese literature and art history). I literally had to go study up...on the mythology and art utilized in this series immediately after the first time I watched it and then immediately watch the whole series over again to grasp what this story was trying to tell me. It's intelligent, understated, and indirect just like the true essence of the Japanese aesthetic; IMO a work of art. on the mythology and art utilized in this series immediately after the first time I watched it and then immediately watch the whole series over again to grasp what this story was trying to tell me. It's intelligent, understated, and indirect just like the true essence of the Japanese aesthetic; IMO a work of art."", 'Gasaraki is one of the more trickier titles I\'ve had to try figuring out in terms of what it wanted to tell and how to critique it. Focused on young mecha pilot Yushiro Gowa, the boy is treated as nothing more than a tool by his family who have considerable influence in Japan\'s military and political world, considering they have Yushiro become part of the country\'s military to test out their mecha, the Tactical Armor. This starts off the complicated tale of Gasaraki, a series that dabbles into political conspiracies, elements of Japanese folklore and the ""real robot"" genre of mecha anime.Let\'s first tackle the...simplest element of the series in the form of its ""real robot"" approach. Directed by the same man involved with 80s mecha title Armored Trooper Votoms, Gasaraki depicts a near-future implementation of its mecha similar to how Patlabor pulls it off with grounded implementation of its technology and limits to how far humans can make use of said robots in battle. This series is one of the more meticulous mecha titles when it comes to detailing the various capabilities of the Tactical Armor units seen throughout the series, demonstrating various elements such as having support staff coordinate mission details and locations, use of the mecha\'s features for various battle scenarios and believably dealing with realistic circumstances such as physics and terrain.The elements of mysticism and politics introduced to the series are the more complicated element to the series and what has led to its very mixed reception among fans. Let\'s dabble into the political element of the series first. The series focuses on some shaky elements related to real-life global issues such as a Middle Eastern conflict similar to the Persian Gulf War and a radical element to Japan\'s relationship with America as the Gowas are among a conspiracy that would involve returning Japan to the militaristic regime it was under before their defeat in World War II. The latter element is the major focus for many of the later episodes in the series as this conspiracy drives Japan and America to the brink of war and the tension escalating from the conflict make for the highlight to this series. The political focus, combined with Gasaraki\'s ""real robot"" element, gives the series a realistic feel as its events give off a serious mood and are often accompanied by news program clips that make for a unique approach to delivering details on the title\'s major events without resorting to narration or exposition.The mysticism element is more of a mixed bag here. The series makes use of elements in Japanese folklore and Noh musical performances to symbolically represent Japan\'s cultural identity and attempt using as a major story element involving the Gowa family. But this attempt felt hackneyed, was not as polished as the political and realistic elements that were otherwise conveyed throughout much of Gasaraki\'s run and lead to a subpar and rushed final episode once events with the American-Japanese political situation get resolved.But perhaps this show\'s biggest issue is that it can be hard for many viewers to stay engaged to it. As lead characters, Yushiro and Miharu are rather bland and even as they are fleshed out, their characters lack much in the way of dimension, they mostly serve as players to the conflicts that play out and Miharu spends a good number of episodes in the second half in a catatonic state. The series also can get in the bad habit of being very dialogue-heavy with the various philosophies and political banter exchanged between characters at a number of points throughout Gasaraki, which become increasingly present during the American-Japanese conflict that takes place. While the exchanges help to get into the heads of some of the characters within the Gowa family, they can be difficult to follow if one isn\'t savvy enough with understanding Japanese history and culture.Visually, Gasaraki is a bit of a mixed bag. The series sports polished and nicely detailed designs for its mecha, solid choreography and fluid movement for mecha battle scenes, implementation of CG animation for computer displays and providing diverse looks for its characters that aren\'t reused for the many designs implemented. However, the color tones used for the visuals are drab, consistency issues with a number of the title\'s designs are an occasional occurrence and details on visual elements not involving mecha and computer screens look rather rough in their appearance.The soundtrack to Gasaraki is perhaps the high point of the series for me, consisting of dramatic and haunting musical pieces that are effectively used in the show\'s many tense and suspenseful moments. The OP and ED for the series (Message #9 and Love Story respectively) are excellent fits for Gasaraki and do well to convey the regular mood and themes that you can expect out of the series.Overall, Gasaraki\'s quite the mixed bag for me. It tries making an effort to be realistic and different with its political and supernatural themes, which works well to a degree with the political elements and realism conveyed in its storytelling. However, these efforts are a double-edged sword as they can limit accessibility and engagement to many viewers with its convoluted themes, heavy-handed philosophizing, sloppy implementation of its supernatural elements and rather bland lead characters. While reputable for its mixture of ""real robot"" and political elements, your mileage will definitely vary with the amount of enjoyment one can get out of Gasaraki. simplest element of the series in the form of its ""real robot"" approach.

The bipedal weapons here are presented as being very new technology to the battlefield, still very limited in many ways but much better suited for urban combat than tanks.

It was deep and complex in itself, however the amount of time spent on any individual detail relevant to the core story wasn't quite enough to really drive it home all the way.

The show portrays a realistic view of what mechs would be like in the modern world. Where so many mecha shows have a toy tie in, forcing elaborate designs and numerous different models, Gasaraki only has a few unique robots and they’re not the type you’d expect to make any toys from.  If you are the type who is sick of how far out there the genre can be, this is a great show to watch where things are a lot more down to Earth.The basic premise of the show is...that the Gowa family, a powerful Japanese family has gotten into the industry of developing mechs known as Tactical Armors (TAs). When a mysterious explosion occurs in the middle-eastern country of Belgistan, the Gowa family jumps at the opportunity to be able to work with the JSSDF (Japanese Strategic Self Defense Force) and use the TAs in real combat and extend their influence on the nation of Japan. At the same time, a mysterious organization called Symbol is also developing their own mechs known as Fakes. Yushiro Gowa, youngest son of the Gowa family is the primary pilot of the TAs. But upon learning some mysteries of his past and encountering the Symbol pilot Miharu, Yushiro decides to break off from his family and find out more about himself.Gasaraki has several things going for it. As mentioned above, the show is far more realistic than the typical mecha show and this results in battles that are a lot different than the typical fare. The show never feels the need to shoehorn us into a battle every episode. There is really only one time in the entire series where I felt a battle was forced. The show has a ton of depth to it. The cast is significant, the plot is complex and the show does a good job of intermingling Shinto-mysticism into the story in a way that fits very well. In fact episodes focusing on this part of the show is arguably the peak of the series. The animation is very consistent, with only a couple of weak episodes. Both the opening and the ending themes have great music. The opening in particular is really unique in that it is made up of footage from future episodes and is changed every couple of episodes.Where I think some people will be bothered by the show is that it goes too far in the political direction to the detriment of entertaining storytelling. Early episodes are filled with many news reports of events in the middle-east, which can be too much for some after several episodes in a row of it. As we start getting into the middle of the series a character, Nishida is introduced who has a quest of overthrowing the Japanese government, with the goal of Japan supplanting the U.S. as the world super power. There are numerous scenes from this point forward where either the character has long monologues or there are long political diatribes between him and other characters about the nature of the Japanese people. It is not the politics I care about here, but rather the fact that from a storytelling standpoint, having episodes that are at least 1/3 to 1/2 filled with a couple of characters in a room talking about a dry subject matter can be rough to watch. Heck, a major plot point of this show is U.S. grain exports. Did you ever think an anime would be about such a topic? Towards the end of the show when the political storyline is resolved the show takes a complete 180 and has one of anime’s most bizarre final episodes, which can also be off putting for people.A big complaint one could have with this show is the dryness of the 2 leads, Yushiro and Miharu. Neither character has much of a personality. While there are some interesting things that happen to them, they are not the type of characters you would typically have much sympathy for because they’re not very relatable. After a notable event in the series Miharu practically goes comatose for at least a half a dozen episodes, not speaking at all. This makes an already dry character even worse. That is not to say that this show doesn’t have some good characters; as it does. The show has several characters who are well developed and interesting. But you’d think the two leads would be among those characters, but in this show it’s far from it.I’ll admit that the show is not for everyone, but it’s worth at least one viewing, especially if you are interested in a show that is different than the cliché stuff out there. that the Gowa family, a powerful Japanese family has gotten into the industry of developing mechs known as Tactical Armors (TAs).

While there are some interesting things that happen to them, they are not the type of characters you would typically have much sympathy for because they’re not very relatable. After a notable event in the series Miharu practically goes comatose for at least a half a dozen episodes, not speaking at all. This makes an already dry character even worse. That is not to say that this show doesn’t have some good characters; as it does. The show has several characters who are well developed and interesting. But you’d think the two leads would be among those characters, but in this show it’s far from it.I’ll admit that the show is not for everyone, but it’s worth at least one viewing, especially if you are interested in a show that is different than the cliché stuff out there.', 'OverallFirst, this is a very slow and heavy anime to watch. It has big ambitions and demands a lot of focus from the viewer. Sadly, a great backstory gets demolished by a slow, dull and uninspiring execution.AnimationConsidering it was made in 1998, you shouldn’t expect too much graphics-wise. Particularly the characters look quite bad and uninspiring. Action sequences are confusing to the point where you don’t know who is who as all the mechas look basically the same. All is not bad though; there are unusually few recycled animations and still frames, and the dark style really creates a nice mood.SoundVoice acting is not bad...per se, it’s just that the script runs along so slowly that every conversation turns out frustratingly calm, there is not much emotion showing at all. Background music and sound effects are quite good and enhances the mood. Opening and ending themes are decent and fitting.StoryStory-wise, Gasaraki is very ambitious. There is a complex and quite cool backstory involving philosophy, high level politics and historical events that all helps supporting the main story. And in 25 episodes, it all gets decently presented and knitted together. The problem is, the pace is so slow that there is little time for anything to really hook the viewer. The characters are left flat and without much depth, just floating along with the current. And there are many instances of “hey, was that sixteenth rescue mission really dramaturgically necessary?” All in all, the story is very interesting in theory, but disastrously poorly executed in practice.CharacterDespite bad graphics, slow pace and lack of hooks, Gasaraki could have been saved by the characters. There are a lot of them and a little personality and depth here and there would have lifted this anime immensely. Sadly, both personality and depth are lacking. There seems to have been to much focus on developing a complex story, and little effort has been put down to bring the story to life.ValueThe G_P sub I watched was good, but the font used made it somewhat hard to read.The re-watch value of Gasaraki depends on how cool you think the story is. It certainly could be watched again to get some things straight. But the slow pace and general dullness speaks against it, at least for me. per se, it’s just that the script runs along so slowly that every conversation turns out frustratingly calm, there is not much emotion showing at all.

I like the character designs and the mechs. But to me the story was unable to engage me and keep me interested despite those cool concepts.If you can bear through it, go ahead however the show as a whole is not interesting enough to me to keep watching but its not irredeemably bad.i think the show would have benefited greatly if the episode count was cut.Moreover its  has difficulty to spice things up, for the most part the show consists of people talking, the dialogue is interesting but...applied to the story it's just unimpacted, for the most part and ep of gasaraki is just an exposition dump, the dump is cool but christ is this boring to watch applied to the story it's just unimpacted, for the most part and ep of gasaraki is just an exposition dump, the dump is cool but christ is this boring to watch"", 'NOT ORIGINAL. SPOILER ALERT.@Shocked defines it like this:Weapons of mass destruction, human experimentation, totalitarianism, extreme xenophobia, non-people, war profiteering, using the guise of an emergency to usurp power, military operations acting independent of sovereign borders, and sacrificing people to enact a perceived necessary evil for some grand ambition for power and control. All of this while utilizing actual mysticism and the salty jingoism seasoned with old tales featuring warriors dying proud for a greater good.@Washi: Gasaraki is one of those rare anime that manage to rise above what could easily have become a convoluted mess of a plot. With elements of military, romance, supernatural,...sci-fi, mecha, history, and politics, Gasaraki is the product of an amalgamation of a whole slew of genres and plot-lines that manages to work. But the hectic plot also means that the show manages to be engaging for the majority of its run without ever resorting to an episodic format, which is a bit of a rarity in anime.One of the shows biggest flaws is its characterization, largely in the first half of the series. > This is true, but it is consistent with the plot and the characters do develop later on, once the plot is ""more consolidated"".By the end of the series I felt a strong affection for many of the characters, and the villains prove to be very satisfying in their antagonistic roles, with Gouda-esque scheming and cunning. The almost iconic Nishida was one of the most interesting characters, a tactical genius and a man of honor and strong values, he provided the backbone for the idealistic elements of the series. Unfortunately, Miharu is never quite granted enough development to make her anything beyond blatantly sympathetic, and Yushiro is often terminally quiet.

While it incorporates a variety of elements into its story, it does not manage to find a way to have them all merge together in a cohesive manner, and having come out just 2 years after Evangelion, in several respects it is entirely blatant in its attempt to emulate Evangelion\'s successes by copying its basic elements, but in the process demonstrates a lack of legitimate understanding of what made them effective to begin with.Set during a fictionalised version of Operation Desert Storm, Gasaraki is...a series that is a lot more grounded in the contemporary than most other mecha, and as one would expect from something based on ODS, it makes extensive usage of footage of news broadcasts and AC-130 camera feeds. More generally, it does use a particularly high volume of POV shots, not just of combat aircraft within the context of news broadcasts, but direct views subject to radio jamming and static, as are the POV shots from the mechs. Although having to deal with jamming and distortion may sound annoying, it does manage to be quite immersive and prevents the camera from feeling like an idle spectator, and does contribute to an overall sense of realism that not many other mecha anime are able to accomplish. The mechs themselves also are well-designed, although if there is one point regarding the mecha design that is deserving of praise, it is not technically the mechs themselves, but rather the radar and support systems that accompany them from the outside, which are intricately detailed, which contrasts with the general approach to visual design present within the rest of the series.Even if its mechs are well-designed, from a visual standpoint, Gasaraki is simply dull to look at. Its colour scheme is extremely muted, with plain black, concrete grey, and olive drab being the dominant colours for close to all of its duration, and it is moreover an especially dark series. Even during scenes set during daytime, nothing in the visual department ever manages to shine or stand out, it’s the kind of landscape that can give you seasonal depression just by looking at it. It is a common occurrence for the scenery to end up obscured by shadows and darkness, and while this darkness is never severe enough that it makes it difficult to actually identify what is happening, it is one aspect that contributes to its overall sleep-inducing aesthetic.Although its portrayal of warfare may be somewhat convincing, the dialogue does not feel believable in any respect, they may have put giant robots in ODS, but that doesn’t come close to being as implausible and anachronistic as the way people talk in Gasaraki. These people do not even come close to sounding like people from the turn of the century, an issue exemplified by the fact that during a flashback episode set in the Sengoku Jidai, nothing changes, everyone talks and behaves the exact same. Even William Shakespeare managed to get more natural-sounding dialogue – as an example, take the “words, words, words” scene from Hamlet, its language may be archaic (as Gasaraki’s often is), but it has a clearly conversational tone with short sentences, a sense of levity, and it manages to cover a lot of ground by having the characters make a point, and then move onto something else once that point was made. Gasaraki’s approach to language is much more Romantic, not just in the poetic sense, but because the writers appeared to have been absolutely infatuated with metaphors, a metaphor is a perfectly standard literary technique that on its own is not very notable, but the use of metaphors in Gasaraki is incessant, and they are persistently drawn out for far longer than they need to be. Even the President of the United States, when discussing civil unrest, has to say “it will be an absolute firestorm of hatred” or something equally pompous, rather than just calling it what it is. As a result, the dialogue ends up feeling tedious, not only do the characters have to explain their plans in full detail to every single person they tell them to, but the long-winded explanations, analogies, and metaphors, all of which seem to operate under the same sort of lexical field of rivers, the wind and other aspects of nature, end up depriving themselves of any level of originality or intrigue almost immediately, and consequently, even though the series has a high volume of dialogue, it ends up feeling like it has very little to say.One might naturally assume that a mecha series is going to feature high-octane action and if not a monster of the week, then at least a monster every two or three weeks, but Gasaraki barely even bothers to utilise its mechs. Initially, the story focuses on the Desert Storm conflict, which lasts for roughly 6-8 episodes, after which point, the mechs are used so sparingly that the OP manages to show them for a greater duration of time than the actual episodes do. The real issue with Gasaraki’s approach to storytelling is it doesn’t have anything in the form of a connective thread across its episodes, a recurring point to keep the viewer invested in its story. If not via consistent action setpieces which are at least viscerally interesting, then the two main aspects that help keep interconnectivity would be either an overarching plot (i.e. a long term goal) or a main character, but Gasaraki has neither. It doesn’t really manage to either conclude its arcs, nor does it keep them relevant into the overall story. It initially is a story about ODS, and then it just isn’t, they mention that the Coalition forces have had their advance halted, but that is it, a story that is initially about a war doesn’t bother to mention whether that war actually ended or not, and throughout the series, they never manage to do anything with the scenarios that they choose to create.Its approach to character is equally lackluster, as it has no real main character for the viewer to follow. Yushiro, the conventional ace pilot (only because they say he is good, as he barely gets a chance to demonstrate his own abilities), hasn’t got any real defining traits that make him identifiable as a character. He is neither proud nor humble, introspective nor extroverted, the only notable thing about Yushiro is he is just along for the ride, he just goes from piloting a mecha to walking cross-country to find some ancient temple, displaying nothing but pure indifference to the whole affair, the metallic helmet he wears manages to convey more in the way of personality and unique attributes than he ever does. The only other people with any influence over the story are the Gowa zaibatsu, who are all given equal prominence, and are basically all the same person, they are all in the same division, doing the same thing, and as with Yushiro, have no defining personality characteristics, much less any clearly defined goals. Everyone talks with the same grandiose metaphors, remains completely calm at all times, and none of them even seem to have differing perspectives amongst each other, obviously they were trying to go for a realistic angle with this series, but even real politicians use personal anecdotes or jokes now and then, and if I am making a positive comparison to the liveliness and interesting demeanour of politicians, that is one serious fucking condemnation.So, when considering how lifeless its characters are, it is especially jarring when the final episode (the only cold open in the series, which only makes it feel more out of place) immediately begins with Yushiro asking questions about his self-identity, coupled with surrealistic imagery and live-action footage. The episodes that preceded it weren’t particularly good, but the finale is especially poor, it could not be more blatant in its attempt to try and replicate Evangelion’s ending, but it just does not work, because you cannot psychologise a character when they have neither any psychology nor any character. Yushiro starts asking questions about the nature of existence, but he never did it until now, and his sudden declaration that he ""wants to live"" comes out of nowhere, their stand-in for Saddam Hussein who only appeared about twice managed to convey a desire to live, but Yushiro never did. The understanding of Evangelion that this episode demonstrates is superficial at best, the series was not praised for the fact that it had a scene where they had a mosaic of the main character’s face coupled with echoed narration about the nature of being alive, it was praised because that was a satisfying culmination of all the ideas that the series had been conveying up until that point, but Gasaraki tries to convey them right as it is about to end, and it only serves to be an astoundingly poor way to conclude a series that had barely managed to conclude its own shorter arcs up until that point.Gasaraki’s realistic approach does make it somewhat of an oddity, it is probably the only mecha to mention the Federal Reserve and the New York Stock Exchange, but it completely fails to capitalise on the interesting ideas that its contemporary setting creates. It is a mecha series that hardly has any mecha combat, no real overarching story to keep the viewer hooked, and its characters are not so much characters as they are mouthpieces for mediocre poetry and tirades about illegal immigrants. Both the Noh and Shintoist iconography, as well as the attachment to real political issues of economic warfare, manage to be interesting ideas that could have made for a great series, but they are never expanded or compounded upon, and the series instead focuses on flat characters, and flatter attempts to copy Evangelion. a series that is a lot more grounded in the contemporary than most other mecha, and as one would expect from something based on ODS, it makes extensive usage of footage of news broadcasts and AC-130 camera feeds.

Sun Tzu said, ""Know the enemy and know yourself, and you need not fear the outcome of a hundred battles."" But what happens when you don\'t know yourself?Gasaraki is many things over the course of its 25 episodes: political drama, near-future war story, mecha action, historical fantasy, and outlandish SF. Yet, reflected through all of its many facets seems to be a unifying philosophical debate about the dangers of not knowing yourself. The...story takes on an unusual structure where preternatural skills at piloting a robot, intelligence, wealth, political power, determination and integrity ultimately count for nothing if your choices are based on a lack of self-understanding.We see this most clearly through Nishida, a character introduced halfway through the series who immediately becomes a gravitational force, bending people and events to his will. This is a man so sure of his convictions that he blinded himself with his sword out of disgust at the current state of the Japanese people, who he perceived as decadent and unprincipled. I\'m not sure what\'s more disturbing about Nishida: that he genuinely believes it\'s in the interest of the Japanese people to cast them into poverty akin to the age of feudal peasantry, that the narrative seems to agree with his xenophobic rhetoric (I have a worrying feeling that Nishida is the writer\'s self-insert character, spouting his own political views), or that practically everyone he speaks to (hero and villain alike) ends up respecting and complying with this character who would be painted as an unambiguous monster in most stories.One of the ways Gasaraki does resemble Evangelion is how it strips power and agency away from giant robot pilots, neutering the usual power fantasy. They\'re pawns, and as the series goes on it becomes increasingly clear that their lack of agency stems from a lack of self-understanding. This takes a familiar form for supposed protagonist Yushiro, in that there are important parts of his past that he\'s forgotten. As he goes on a journey of self-discovery, and comes to know who he is and what he wants, his ability to influence events and make choices he can live with increases. Meanwhile, the rest of Yushiro\'s military unit never undergo such an epiphany. There\'s a telling flashback where the unit commander tells a room full of recruits that it\'s okay to spend their whole life figuring out what they believe in, that he acts on his beliefs, but that he can\'t put into words what they are. That ignorance about their own beliefs eventually comes back to haunt them once they\'re pulled into the orbit of Nishida\'s psychopathic charisma. Ironically, even Nishida ultimately finds events unfolding in a way he didn\'t anticipate, though in his case it\'s not from lack of understanding himself, but because he closed himself off and literally blinded himself to the true nature of the enemy.Aside from some troubling political views, where Gasaraki falters most is in the balancing act it tries to pull between all the many genres it tries to blend. It feels most at home in the offices of its Machiavellian power players, or on the battlefield where its outstanding mecha animation and direction recall Patlabor 2 at times. It\'s less sure-footed when it reaches for emotion rather than intellectual stimulation or action though, since a lot of the characters are rather lacking in depth or personality beyond their politics. The wilder SF and fantasy elements also never gel well with its meticulously realistic ones, to the point where it almost feels like watching two unrelated series spliced together at times.Its strengths ultimately outweigh its weaknesses, despite a shaky final episode. If Gasaraki had focused entirely on its strengths, it could have been an all-time classic. As it stands, it\'s still one of the most fascinating shows of the 90s. story takes on an unusual structure where preternatural skills at piloting a robot, intelligence, wealth, political power, determination and integrity ultimately count for nothing if your choices are based on a lack of self-understanding.We see this most clearly through Nishida, a character introduced halfway through the series who immediately becomes a gravitational force, bending people and events to his will.

There is  a certain seriousness about it and it poses some deeper questions arising from the clash and a blending of traditional and modernist views of society, social rank, pride, and...honor prevalent in post WWI and pre-WWII Europe.  . . . . if you take it with several very large grains of salt, that is.  It is Anime after all.  Clothing styles are more late 1800's but the mixing of horse drawn vehicles, automobiles and zeppelins, and absence of electricity, is actually fairly believable.  There is angst aplenty, conspiracy, dirty politics, double dealing, power plays, and more, while the beautiful young men work to keep one member of the group from being expelled, another from being taken to task for something far worse, and well, generally saving the kingdom as a whole.The sound track for MLW was, thankfully, better than the first but still far from good.  The OP and ED, although better than the first, still fails to match the mood of the story.The settings are beautiful.  A moody pallet sets an atmosphere for mystery, the character designs are great, and the story is fast paced.  The characters behave in a solemn, aristocratic manner appropriate to the time and place.  There is verbal fencing as well as that with swords.  As stated before, I liked it but, as enjoyable as it was, it left something on the table that I think was plot and character development.  I give it an 8 because it is better than a seven. honor prevalent in post WWI and pre-WWII Europe.  . . . . if you take it with several very large grains of salt, that is.  It is Anime after all.

Getsuyoubi no Tawawa 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49854/Getsuyoubi_no_Tawawa_2,"[""If you like big anime titties then Tawawa on Monday is the show for you. I cannot be any more direct than that - this anime is literally about worshiping the voluptuous glandular tissues of cute girls via constant zoom ins, boob jiggles, bras snapping, torso touching, groping, stripping, basically anything under the sun that can be done with a pair of tits is likely to be found in here in bite sized, short episodical formatting (barring nudity, more on that later). Tawawa also entertains fantasy romantic scenarios between faceless, self insert men who are attracted to these women, and are teased incessantly until eventually...entering a relationship. Wholesome stuff for the hopeless perverted romantics out there.If you fall into this very transparent target audience, then there’s really only a few areas of criticism that can be made. One is the lack of actual nudity and intimacy - at no point will you see any of these girls wearing less than a swimsuit, and never will the couples be shown doing anything beyond holding hands and a kiss on the cheek. There is a line that this ecchi will never cross no matter how much you may want it to happen, and that can be a point of irritation for us degenerates that want the full package that prior shows have bridged in the past (such as the legendary Shinmai Testament, for instance). But on the contrary to that criticism, others find it more enticing to be teased of a possibility that is dangled in front of them. To that end Tawawa is one of the better anime that can exist, as it finds creative ways to show you the allure of big titties without ever allowing you to see them entirely exposed or embraced. It’s not smut nor hentai, but it can kinda co-exist with those shows as a less lewd cock teasing alternative.Another point of contention is the art style difference from season 1, as the studio’s changed so did the character artwork - the faces are noticeably wider than before, as if some invisible force is stretching their cheeks apart, and the eyes shapes are larger to fit a more moe aesthetic. There is a divide in the Tawawa community over whether this change was for the worse or is negligible - I belong the latter camp, as I recognize this as a fantastical anime where everything is out of proportion, and it does not break my immersion for the character designs to lose the sense of realism.You can pretty much tell whether or not you’ll like this show from looking at the promotional art. Despite my wall of text analyzing the quality of this tit show, the content is as shallow as a puddle and the merit is apparent on chest value. If it weren't for the character limit I'd probably just end the review at the first sentence - If you like big anime titties then Tawawa on Monday is the show for you. entering a relationship.

From the very first episode, the anime just straightforwardly screams at you ""Boobs! Boobs!"". For those unfortunate ones who like them smaller, hurry up and turn away from this one, this show ain\'t for you.Story: Anime has little to no story. It\'s about our main characters daily life and their relationships. It\'s short one 6 minutes for an episode so the fact that it\'s lacking any deep story isn\'t so impacting and after watching the whole show you couldn\'t even care less so whatever.Art: Normal 2D animation without overusing CGI. I...guess I could say that it\'s better than some other shows in this aspect.Sound: Most of the time there ain\'t any BGM. And the ED is one of those that you really want to skip, which is a shame.--Best character Ai-chan :)Enjoyment: Really slow anime that sometimes makes you cringe. But a good one to watch when bored.Overall judgment: For those who like big anime titties this one is for you, but don\'t search for the story. It has none and it\'s just a daily life slice of life. Still better show than the second season of mushoku tensei will be. lol guess I could say that it\'s better than some other shows in this aspect.Sound: Most of the time there ain\'t any BGM.

I thought that was peak, and I never thought that season 2 would be 10 times better. The second season really exceeded all my expectations. The production quality was much higher as well. I do not want to repeat myself but all I have mentioned in my review for season 1 specials applies to this season as well.Story: 10/10As mentioned in the first season review, there are a lot of very creative and hilarious scenes in this anime. I love how this anime does not hold back with the ridiculousness. That is probably the...reason why this masterpiece can exist. The creator is an absolutely crazy genius. Right off the bat, in the first episode, Ai-chan and her younger sister were watching a movie where muscular men flex their muscles and rip the clothes off, AND THEN BOTH OF THE GIRLS TRIED THE SAME THING WITH THEIR BOOBS. THEY WERE COMPARING HOW MANY BUTTONS OF THEIR SHIRT THEY CAN POP JUST BY STRETCHING THEIR BOOBS. EXCUSE ME BUT WHAT THE FUCK? I just had to pause the video and roll on the floor laughing. There's another scene where the mother is talking to Ai-chan and her sister with a sexy bra in her hand, TELLING THEM THAT IT'S THANKS TO THESE THINGS THAT THEY TWO WERE ABLE TO BE BORN, THEN SHE TELLS BOTH OF THEM TO BOW DOWN TO THE BRA. I have no idea what the fuck I've just watched but I love it.Art: 10/10Absolutely stunning. No words I could use would do the art justice. The girls looks like something god himself had created after perfecting the skills of crafting the absolute beauty since the dawn of mankind. Every frame looks so clean and easy on the eyes.Sound: 10/10The voice acting is perfect. All the girls do not sound forced, they sound very natural as if it was actually happening to them while they do the voices. It's extremely pleasant to the ears. The soundtrack and the endings are great as well.Character: 10/10All the girls are extremely likeable, all of them have the ideal personality any man would want. I wish girls like this exist in real life. My favourite character is probably the cute, playful, cheeky student with the long bangs who confessed to her teacher. The Maegami-chan who was voiced by the one and only Takahashi Rie (who did Megumin from Konosuba, Emilia from ReZero, Takagi from Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san). Episode 2 must have been the episode which really made me like Maegami-chan. The whole backstory of the teacher not wanting to reciprocate her feelings because they are teacher-student really made me realise how persistent she was for having to wait for 3 years. She refuses to give up, and does a lot of teasing and trickery such as pretending to accept another guy's confession just so that she can see the teacher panicking. What a character. One thing I also do appreciate is that the male characters are also decent and not perverted at all, which is great for male viewers to self-insert because no male viewer actually wants to pretend that they are creepy bastards in the anime. Although another thing to note is that all the girls, even the side characters, have big boobs in this anime, so make sure you are into that or else this anime might not be for you.Enjoyment: 10/10I have never enjoyed myself watching anime more than watching this anime series. There really is nothing much more to add.Overall: 10/10Just watch it.

Mommy Milkers. Sweater Cows. Bazongas. Oppai. Booba. Hummina hummina hummina awoooga. Train whistle noises. All of these are things you can say about Tawawa.I remember watching season 1 back when it came out, and was pleasantly surprised that it got more. I love when these very short anime series manage to have continuity between episodes and kind of tell a cohesive story. While it\'s not a series heavy with a lot of plot, it is heavy with a lot of... ""plot"", if you know what I\'m saying.The plot is still pretty good, and is surprisingly wholesome considering the J-cup package it\'s being delivered...in.

That and like others that have read manga with a focus on Tawawa this...anime S1 & 2 are no different. It may be a fanservice show at first glance but it also has that fair share of slice of life moments and enough content even for short form episodes it cuts out the nonsense and balances the two well.I have since seen the special and it was fine, not S1 OVAs great (nothing will be the watching Tawawa on Monday on DVD inside the show itself) but good enough for a pretty predictable OVA type of episode (spoilers: beach episode from what I remember).It's a show to just relax and watch some slice of life and ecchi fan service. The art style change while noticeable didn't ruin the show. The fan service moments are brief but when dealing with 6 minute episodes (including ED, no OP) they only appear for certain scenes or a few seconds that or part of the dialogue sometimes. The moments between each of the two characters (the girls and the men they have conversations with or Ai-chan and her friend) all have enjoyable moments of dialogue. Nothing ground breaking but can be a little funny or just natural to the scenarios they are in. It's still anime silly but if your fine with that by all means.

This is a show with 6 minute episodes (including ED but no OP) and while sure the scenes aren't anything mindblowing some pacing like in episode 2 is impressive, while that shouldn't matter and in a longer length show or many episodes later events happening for 1 couple. For a single episode to have a variety of scenes sum up events when most anime take longer I think is amazing. Short shows aren't worth ignoring fan service or otherwise when people do in seasonal roundups.Otherwise Maegami and her partner do progress throughout the scenes they are in. The others don't so don't expect a lot.It isn't shown as a backstory but in many cases could be but does it well to show all we really need to know with the time span given. The girls do talk in some episodes whether neighbours or shopping and it's nice to see the characters not just in the same situations/locations all the time and with the male characters they talk to all the time and it being too formulaic.A fine watch.

I was pleasantly surprised. This time it follows 4 couples instead of just 2, a huge improvement.

Fully grasping the scale of G-Reco is like memorizing the rules of a board game, only to watch it be played out by amateurs who can\'t tell a pawn from a bishop. In this vein, G-Reco leans heavily into the concept of Chaos theory—just like a cue ball hitting billiards, Bellri and Co\'s battlefield antics see characters unpredictably and hilariously smashing into each other, as enemies and allies alike struggle to understand just what the fuck is actually going on.An integral component of...G-Reco to keep in mind is that all sides of the conflict are inept at war. G-Reco exists in a post U.C era in which the monopolization of resources gave way to a society of platitude and irenicism. It\'s where the heart of all conflicts within G-Reco stem from—every faction wants to have its own say in how resources and land should be handled, whether that be Ameria\'s desire to put an end to Gondowans monopolization, or the Dollete family\'s Reconquista plan. Everyone has opposing ideas for how the world should be run, so watching them all—ill-informed and pig-headed as they are—crash into each other like tectonic plates is nothing short of enjoyable. It\'s a catfight, if you will, a certified, bonafide shit show. And it\'s precisely this rampant, unceremonious, unadulterated chaos which feeds into G-Reco\'s two most nuanced themes: ideology and apprehension. Most of the characters in G-Reco have absolutely no idea what they\'re doing, and that\'s not limited to those following orders but to those giving them as well. Everyone\'s following a narrative, an ideology they\'ve chosen to back, despite not fully understanding what they\'re committing to. With this in mind, the key struggle between the cast is in apprehending and understanding one another, as opposed to fighting their enemies. Rather intelligently, these themes can be extended to real-life, as in the case of political and social narratives, but also, it\'s even applicable—whether it be with intent or just coincidence—to the people who watched G-Reco and didn\'t understand it despite Tomino beating its themes over their heads above twelve billion times per episode.There\'s a lot of little details in G-Reco that go unappreciated. One of my favourites is how zero-G is actually treated like zero-G: characters are constantly ramming into things, hitting their heads on ceilings or having objects ricochet into their faces, as opposed to other Gundam entries where zero-G enables the characters seemingly perfect XYZ movement, without the humorous and annoying hindrances G-Reco revels in. Details like that are exacerbated ten-fold in these films, for instance, Bellri\'s breakdown at the Rayhunton reveal is opened with a subtle yet highly interesting character detail that recontextualizes the whole scene. It\'s something I suspect will fly over a lot of the audience\'s heads, as it\'s really something only Tomino would do. Other aspects of G-Reco, like its seemingly random, non-sequitur dialogue, is something that, in any other show, would come off as downright awful writing, though, somehow, feels right at home spoken amongst the absolute blockheads that make up G-Reco\'s cast.I\'ll be one to admit that a second viewing of G-Reco made everything much clearer in terms of the allegiances and MOs of the secondary cast, and I\'m probably not wrong in saying that the film\'s overhaul of the original script has a part to play in that. They haven\'t changed too much, but what they have changed has proven to be an overall net benefit for the narrative G-Reco was originally trying to tell. The addition of new scenes—especially those pertaining to Bellri—strengthens the emotional throughline of the series by making the cast feel a bit more real and their plights a bit more personal. A good deal of these changes were made due to the negative backlash G-Reco received when it had initially released. And while some diehards say those changes ruin the point of G-Reco, I\'d argue the complete opposite, as all the new changes feel like the missing pieces G-Reco always needed. A great example would be how every Nut on Capital Tower has been made more distinct from each other to provide some passive worldbuilding—giving each Nut the feeling of a unique culture imbued into it by its inhabitants.Specific to this film, a few new scenes were added to provide some connective sinew between story beats, like the opening scene, which catches the audience up on the Megafauna\'s current situation. Scenes like that are welcome as they ease most of G-Reco\'s original pacing issues. A lot of the \'dead space\' got cut out of the films, which, unfortunately, makes some of the better-paced segments feel rushed in comparison to their TV counterparts. For example, the moments where Raraiya slowly gains her normal cognition back were cut from the film, leaving the scene where she regains all her memories feeling like a pay-off bereft of build-up. There are a few more examples of this, but it all seems like necessary changes to make room for new plotlines in the upcoming films. Apart from that and the aforementioned pacing issues, I would still strongly recommend this version of G-Reco over the previous series, even just for the touched-up sequences alone. These films greatly benefit from adapting clusters of episodes into chunks, it leaves everything feeling far more comprehensible, even if a little truncated.Additionally, the inclusion of the song ""G"" by Dreams Come True acts as this great emotional motif for the trilogy as a whole, helping it stand out from the original whilst promoting a sentimental continuity completely unique to this version. In particular, the reuse of the dance eyecatchers here for the credits was the icing on the cake.There\'s one more thing I want to touch on: it\'s generally well-known that Tomino is on the way out, so to speak. He has future endeavours planned for after this pentalogy, but with him recently turning 80 and his worsening spinal issues, it\'s safe to assume that these films will probably be the last of his career. Of course, I could be completely wrong—in fact, I want to be proven wrong. But in the unfortunate eventuality that this is Tomino\'s last rodeo, I find it a bit disheartening that this titan of the industry, ""Kill \'em all"" Tomino, will have his swan song echo out to the applause of so few. The fact that the second G-Reco film still doesn\'t have a staff listing on Mal is telling of this.Tomino\'s core message with G-Reco was that he wanted the current and next generation of young people to adapt to the incoming future and solve the global problems caused by their progenitors. I think it would be nice for his legacy and that message to continue to be felt even after this last project comes to its close. I have no doubt Tomino himself will be cherished as a national treasure, but the positivity of G-Reco is something dearly needed and something I think the world would ultimately benefit from—a return to Genki.

I would highly recommend watching the raw version though (the dubbed version's voices were a bit messed up).I believe that the primary reason for watching this is Link...and you get to see him actually fight in an anime scene, what else is there to say?You 've got nothing to lose whatsoever, it's 2 minutes long, just watch it. "", ""Well as this has its own page I thought I would write a review on it. This wont be long as the video itself is only around a minute long and it is my first review so keep that in mind when reading.The video does not really have a story and is only really there for showing off the characters and promoting the video game, but in the short time it is on it really gets you excited. When I first watched the video I was amazed and thought Nintendo was making a Super Smash bros anime (sadly not) It looks amazing the characters act...like you expect them to in a fight. I really love how they didn't make Link talk but still had him show emotion with his actions.This short video is awesome and it really makes me want to see a Super Smash Bros anime, I feel that it would be amazing after watching this short one minute video.I think anyone who has not seen this video yet should go check it out and enjoy some awesome Nintendo heros fight it out like you expect them to in a fight.

While I played plenty of Final fantasy games over the years I have yet to play the game that this anime used as a source material so im unable to compare the two.The premise behind Granblue fantasy is a rather simple one but never less one that is already well tread in the anime world. The hero character rescues a beautiful but mysterious girl from an evil enemy faction and then...embarking on a quest to find and save mysterious but powerful creatures and gain their allegiance to you while at the same time fighting to stop the evil faction from doing the same. Along the way they are joined by a handful of characters that join them for a variety of motivations. The premise while standard also has a number of innovations that enable it to stand out more. These include the use of airships to travel around the rather large world with, large variety of summons, a far from straight forward plot and large battles between summons.Story and settingThe overall plot for the series of Granblue fantasy revolves around a journey that the main characters embark upon both to explore the land but also to find the various legendary beasts that populate the land and protect them from the main enemy faction that’s in the series. A substantial sub plot for the series deals with the protection of the series main heroine and the attempt to allow her to see and understand the world that she lives in while protecting her while at the same time foiling the enemy’s major plans to expand their influence in the world.The series as a whole is set in a fantasy like setting where both airships and magic exist and are common place. The world that this series is set in seems have a number of different countries and locations that are populated with a variety of different races each with their own looks and unique behaviors and manners. A key component of the setting of this series are the legendary primal beasts which are creatures that were created by another race long ago and left in the land to serve as guardian deities for various locations around the world.   These serve as a key part of the empires plans that the heroes need to stop as part of the story.GranGran voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuki Ono is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the main protagonist of the series and the overall leader of the team with the title of captain. A young teenage human male in his late teens Gran is a kind and caring person that has a personality that can be best described as one that puts the needs of the others before his own. As a result, Gran is someone that is well trusted by all that meet him as while easy going and kind to a fault he’s also not the type that will be cruel or unkind to others without good reason.  An honorable but also a determined person Gran is someone that always tries to help those in need even of these people are complete strangers to him which in the series has the effect of gathering many allies to him. As a result of living in a remote island that lies away from the major countries in the world Gran is naturally curious about the world that lies beyond his home which is reinforced by the books that he has read as a child. In particular Gran since when he little has dreamed of exploring the skies in an airship of his own a dream that was finally achieved by the journey that he embarked on with Lyria after meeting her. A prominent trait of Gran’s is that Gran seems to prefer to sort out disagreements via peaceful methods through negotiation and is always willing to listen to the viewpoints of all the parties that are involved in it before deciding. As the series progresses Gran noticeably more braver and more determined to protect his friends and allies from harm but at the same time has also become more willing to apply more restraint to his actions and as a result not rush into battles like he did in the past.  Though hinted at in the beginning of the series as the series progresses it becomes apparent that Gran is someone that cares a great deal about friendship and the bonds that he makes with people. This has the effect of making Gran more determined than ever to protect those that are dear to him.Gran’s friendship and unique bond that he shares with Lyria forms a central part of this series and forms part of the main plot. In the beginning of the series Gran and his pet dragon Vyrm encountered Lyria by chance deep in a forest that lay on his island of birth and despite the sudden meeting soon struck up a friendship. As the series progresses and after finding out Lyria’s painful past and childhood Gran becomes more determined to protect her from the empire and at the same time more understanding of her personality and as a result he tries pretty hard to show Lyria how beautiful this world is while at the same time dispelling the effects that her past memories have on her. As a result of a near death experience in the past Gran has rather interesting bond with Lyria in that he’s able to summon powers that are derived from Lyria that can make him more powerful in combat. At the same time on an emotional level Gran is able to deduce and understand the types of thoughts that are going through Lyria’s psyche which is especially important when they are protecting her from the empire’s plans. All in all, I felt that Gran was a pretty well-designed character that though the archetypal good guy proved that if you have both a determination to protect your friends and allies from an enemy that is stronger than you and a will to define the enemies plan then you too can become a hero. Heroes are after all made from a determination to do something extraordinary and I would say standing up to an evil empire to protect your friends and allies more than qualifies Gran as a hero.LyriaLyria voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of Asterisk wars and Gate fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A young teenage girl that has a rather dark and tragic past that has made her life hell the moment that she was born. Personality wise Lyria is an innocent, kind and curious young woman that until she met Gran knew little of the world itself due to being imprisoned by the empire. Initially Lyria’s personality was a bit on the quiet side as besides Katalina Gran and Vyrm were the first people that she met that were friendly to her. But at the same time, she was also curious about the world around her and as a result she and Gran soon struck up a friendship. As the series progresses Lyria noticeably becomes more talkative and at the same time more compassionate towards others and more willing to help others which I believe is something that she learned from Gran. Despite being curious Lyria is someone that always tries to respect local custom and as a result respects the local gods for each area that she visits with the cast. This respect for local customs I felt was well done and in line with her personality. As the series progresses and more and more allies join her and Grans party Lyria is slowly able to come out of her shell by slowly making friends with her new teammates and places an immense level of trust in them something that each of them soon return as well. Lyria’s most prominent trait is without a doubt her compassion towards others as over the course of the series though Lyria and Gran and co encounter many situations where simply eliminating the enemy might have been an easier choice Lyria would often sympathize with the enemy and understand the reasons for their actions which is another thing that I felt really matched her personality of disliking violence. As a result of meeting so many different people and making so many friends one trait that Lyria developed as the series went on was her playfulness which I felt was funny and a sign that her personality really is changing for the better.Despite her brave and positive front however behind this mask of hers one can see that Lyria still wrestles with inner struggles that affect her greatly made even more so because of her somewhat fragile personality. As a result of her friendships and bonds that she has forged with members of her party Lyria is very happy that she has managed to make some friends but at the same time because of her past Lyria fights against the belief that she herself is a burden to her friends and allies a fact that although the cast know about can do little more than try and support her and cheer her up with. This struggle of Lyria that she faces alone is actually tied with Lyria’s role in the overall plot and I thought it was done pretty well. The manner of how this was eventually solved by the cast though I thought was brilliant and heart-warming as it made use of each of the bonds that her friends have established with her to bring her back from despair.As a character, I felt that Lyria was a pretty well-designed character that was developed rather well in the series. Though quiet and somewhat wary of strangers at first it was nice to see Lyria develop into a strong but also compassionate person that cares about her friends and allies and will not let her past dictate her life. The struggles that Lyria in this series I felt was actually pretty well done and it was heart-breaking to see Lyria give in to despair and shut her friends out after being told the truth of her past by the empire. I was glad that in the end that the cast managed to get through to her and bring her back through the bonds and memories that they had with her. I felt that Nao Touyama really did an excellent job portraying Lyria.KatalinaKatalina voiced by veteran seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro of Sword art online 2 and Rokka no Yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Gran and Lyria’s main allies in the series. A veteran knight formerly of the empire Katalina serves as both Lyria’s first friend and also her guardian. As a knight Katalina is a stoic, brave and calm person that is able to stay composed and rationally even when under pressure. Unlike many knights of the empire however Katalina is also compassionate and kind and also honorable which is the prime reason why she decided to leave the empire with Lyria. Even before meeting with Gran and the rest of the cast Katalina and Lyria actually knew each other as she was charged with watching over her. As a result of this duty however Katalina saw first-hand how the empire treated Lyria and as a result caused her to have pity for Lyria and caused her to forge a friendship and bond with her by teaching her about the world. This also served as a catalyst that led to their escape from the empire and the beginning of the main story.As a result of her bond with Lyria Katalina sees herself as her guardian and as a result she takes the safety of Lyria pretty seriously. As a result of this Katalina can be slow to trust strangers and be rather icy towards them but this is something that comes from her determination to protect Lyria from all threats as more than ever Katalina wants Lyria to have a life that can be considered normal for someone her age and not be treated as something that’s not even a human being by the likes of the empire. Personality wise Katalina has what can be considered to be a big sister type personality as she tries to more responsible for the main members of the party much of which are still teenagers though far too often their actions and the results of their actions often instead surprise her instead. Still this side of her personality was interesting to see. A peculiar trait of Katalina is the fact that she seems to adore cute things of which Vyrn is often an unwitting target for her which I found to quite funny. I felt that Miyuki Sawashiro really did a great job of portraying the character of Katalina who despite being a knight that’s both stoic and composed can also be surprisingly compassionate and caring as well.VyrnVyrn voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Kugimiya of elDLIVE and Persona 4 the animation fame is one of the main characters of the show and is one of Gran and Lyria’s main allies. A small flying dragon that’s been with Gran since he was a child Vyrn is a funny creature that’s also shown to be intelligent and compassionate and is also considerate towards the feelings of others. At the same time Vyrn is also shown to be very loyal to both Gran and his friends and always tries to point out the best possible paths for them. Because of his small size Vyrn has limited offensive capabilities but he’s shown to have a large heart and sensitive to the feelings of others that are around him and often tries to cheer them up to the best of his ability. A prominent trait of Vyrn is the fact that he is easily distracted on what is being discussed which is often used as comic relief. Though Vyrn as a character is a relatively small role I felt that Rie Kugimiya really did a great job voicing him.IoIo voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yukari Tamura of Re Zero and Naruto fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Gran and Lyria’s main allies in the series. A young mage from a country that Gran and co visited early in their travels Io is a young teenage girl that despite her young age is actually quite the proficient mage having a variety of spells at her disposal.  Personality wise Io is a kind and caring person that has a positive and bubbly demeanor suitable for her age. Despite that she can also be stubborn and has an interesting trait of not respecting people that should deserve respect as a result of their age. This is most often applied to Rackam who was actually the one that started it in the first-place due to his underestimation of magic that Io wields. Despite her positive and bubbly personality Io as a result of her stubbornness can be overly proud of her abilities but however is not too stubborn to ask for help. As a result of living with only her master since she was little Io is very close to her master values the relationship that he has with him. As a result of living alone for much of her life Io can be slow to trust people and indeed it took her some time to establish a friendship with Gran and the others.  Despite this Io is someone that has a strong sense of justice and can’t stand the sight of innocents being hurt by others and as a result she hates people that do that for whatever reason.  A recurring trait of Io’s that seems to be used for comical effect in this series is that Io hates being seen as a child which she actually is despite the fact that her abilities as a mage certainly match the level of a teenager instead.Like Rackam  Io too has a sub story arc that is used to develop and flesh out her character while also allowing the main cast to get to know her. In the case of Io her sub story arc’s main focus was her attempts to track down the whereabouts of her master who had vanished around the time that Gran and the others had arrived in her home. This story arc I felt was actually well done as it showed just how much trust Io had in her master having known him for a number of years and proves that if someone that you known begins to act out of character then they are lightly being controlled by something or someone. Seeing Io be able to deduce this and see her refusing to give up on him was something that I thought was nicely done and showed just how close they were. I was really glad that her arc resulted in the freeing of her master from the mind control though. All in all, I felt that Io was a pretty well-designed character that showed that despite her young age that she was still capable of casting complex magic attack spells that could exceed the attack power of adults like Rackam. At the same time, it was also nice that despite her slow to trust nature Io was able to form a friendship with people that are more along her age like Lyria and Gran. Although Rackam and Io did not get on with in the beginning it was nice that by the end of the series that both have managed to develop an element of trust in each other. All in all, I felt that Yukari Tamura really did a great job in voicing Io.RosettaRosetta played by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Tanaka is one of the main support characters of the show and one of Gran and Lyria’s main allies. A mysterious female mage that’s been helping the party since the beginning Rosetta is an enigmatic and mysterious mage that seems to know many secrets about both the empire’s plans and also about their many experiments but likes to hold these back for the opportune time to tell anyone. Despite her mysterious nature that many would argue would make her untrustworthy Rosetta doesn’t seem to let this bother her as she is shown to be able to deflect suspicion that others have on her with humor which I felt was interesting. Despite her enigmatic nature when Rosetta interacts with Gran and co it can be seen that Rosetta actually has a kind and caring personality while also being intelligent and well read. Rosetta has shown to be a powerful mage as she is able to intervene in various actions without being discovered with her most notable feat of being on hand to rescue the cast from a tidal wave. Although not featured until near the end of the series I felt that Rosetta was a pretty interesting character and that her seiyuu Rie Tanaka really did a great job in voicing her. I do feel that she along with a number of other support characters could have been brought into the story a bit earlier though.EugenEugen voiced by veteran voice actor Kazuhiro Yamaji is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Gran and Lyria’s allies in the series. A mid aged man that lives in the chain of islands that forms the island nation Eugen is an old friend of Rackam and both were helmsman in the past before they went their separate ways. A veteran adventurer that has great skill in the use of firearms that is best shown in the final battles of the series Eugen is highly regarded and respected in his home town of Auguste and you can see that the people there really look to up to him for advice and guidance. Personality wise Eugen is a brave and wise person that’s also fast on his feet and is able to easily adapt to different situations on the field. Eugen is also a dependable person and is shown to be very loyal to the people that live in his hometown willing to put himself in harm’s way to protect them. The character of Eugen I felt was an interesting character as he brought a lot of experience to the cast which until his introduction was mainly provided by Katalina and Rackam. The rapport that Eugen and Rackam had was also interesting to see and it was nice to see them use this during combat as well.RackamRackam voiced by veteran voice actor Hiroaki Hirata of Digimon fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Gran and Lyria’s main allies. A talented helmsman and a capable mechanic Gran and Lyria encounter Rackam early on in their journey. When they were both looking for an airship and someone to fly it. Personality wise Rackam is a relatively cheerful and carefree person at first glance but he’s also one that’s very single minded with his tasks and will often spend a lot of time on repairing something as can be expected from a mechanic. Although not one to trust people easily Rackam is also someone that values honesty and truth above all else and will not hesitate to help those in need even if it meant facing steep odds. Although disbelieving of Lyria and Grans powers at first Rackam soon become a believer after seeing them manage to subdue a deity that was attacking the very island that he had lived on his whole life. As a result of his easy-going nature Rackam is able to forge a bond of friendship with Gran and the rest of the cast quite easily and as the series progresses Rackam is shown to become very loyal to his friends and determined to help them in their journey. Rackam I felt was an interesting character as though he may be care free and relaxed most of the time when he does get serious he’s shown to be very loyal to his friends and allies. At the same time, I thought that he was very brave in choosing to stand up against the empire when they attacked his airship which ultimately started him on his journey with Gran and the others. Though Rackam does get on well with most of the cast the notable exception here is Io and I thought that the arguments that they get into were quite hilarious and funny. Im glad that in the end that both were able to fully trust each other with their backs in the final battles of the series.Arts and animationIn terms of art for the series I felt that the series did pretty well in depicting the scenery for the various countries and cities that the cast visit over the course of the series. The character designs for the main cast as well as other characters that were featured in this series I felt was also done pretty well. In particular I really liked the design of the various primal beasts that the cast faced in this series as each was pretty unique just like the abilities that they made use of. Animation for the series I felt was pretty good with the animation being pretty smooth and clear. The combat scenes in this series I felt were pretty well done and were very well designed both in regard to the fights against the empires ground troops and the fight against the primal beasts.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty well done with the opening theme being pretty catchy. The ending theme as well I though was pretty good as well. Individual scene music I felt was good and I loved the battle themes that played during the battle as they helped make those scenes more dramatic.Voice actingVoice acting for the series I felt was pretty strong throughout the series with the seiyuu’s for Lyria, Io and Katalina who are Nao Touyama, Yukari Tamura and Miyuki Sawashiro deserving praise for their performances. I also felt that Rie Tanaka and Rie Kugimiya did a pretty good job in voicing their respective characters despite the limited presence that both characters have in the overall story. This series is also notable for featuring a number of support characters that only showed up near the end of the series that were voiced by a number of talented seiyuu’s like MAO, Kana Hanazawa. While certainly welcome I felt that these veterans and their respective characters could have been used earlier in the series. Still it was nice to hear them I guess.Overall conclusionOverall, I felt that Granblue fantasy was an excellent anime that had among its strengths an interesting setting and theme, interesting story, excellent characters, great combat scenes and excellent voice acting.The premise for the show in this case was based on two different concepts which are both related to Lyria as she is the main heroine that the story is based around. These two concepts are the ideas of identity and freedom. While the show focuses on the exploration of the world by the main cast the overall plot is centered on allowing the main cast to not just protect Lyria but also allow her to create an identity of her own that is free from her past and thus allowing her to live her own life the way that she wants to live it and as a human being that has friends and a unique personality that belongs only to herself and not constrained by her past. I thought that these two themes combined with the story was a strong point for this series. The way that empire treated Lyria when they were holding her though really made me mad when seeing them do that and really helped in making the story even more compelling for me as I believe that just as in the theme every living thing should have their own life and be able to live their life the way that they want without being constrained in any way. The characters for the show I felt were pretty well designed and though they were total strangers at first watching them develop and form bonds of friendship as they built up trust with one another and eventually can fight as a well-coordinated party was a nice thing to see. However, I do believe that appeared in the series could have been introduced into the series a bit earlier in the series as characters like Eugen were not really given much development in the series. The combat scenes for the series I felt was pretty good especially in relation to the battles against the primal beasts and watching the main cast attack a sea dragon with support from their many allies was immensely satisfying. embarking on a quest to find and save mysterious but powerful creatures and gain their allegiance to you while at the same time fighting to stop the evil faction from doing the same. Along the way they are joined by a handful of characters that join them for a variety of motivations. The premise while standard also has a number of innovations that enable it to stand out more. These include the use of airships to travel around the rather large world with, large variety of summons, a far from straight forward plot and large battles between summons.Story and settingThe overall plot for the series of Granblue fantasy revolves around a journey that the main characters embark upon both to explore the land but also to find the various legendary beasts that populate the land and protect them from the main enemy faction that’s in the series. A substantial sub plot for the series deals with the protection of the series main heroine and the attempt to allow her to see and understand the world that she lives in while protecting her while at the same time foiling the enemy’s major plans to expand their influence in the world.The series as a whole is set in a fantasy like setting where both airships and magic exist and are common place. The world that this series is set in seems have a number of different countries and locations that are populated with a variety of different races each with their own looks and unique behaviors and manners. A key component of the setting of this series are the legendary primal beasts which are creatures that were created by another race long ago and left in the land to serve as guardian deities for various locations around the world.   These serve as a key part of the empires plans that the heroes need to stop as part of the story.GranGran voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuki Ono is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the main protagonist of the series and the overall leader of the team with the title of captain. A young teenage human male in his late teens Gran is a kind and caring person that has a personality that can be best described as one that puts the needs of the others before his own. As a result, Gran is someone that is well trusted by all that meet him as while easy going and kind to a fault he’s also not the type that will be cruel or unkind to others without good reason.  An honorable but also a determined person Gran is someone that always tries to help those in need even of these people are complete strangers to him which in the series has the effect of gathering many allies to him. As a result of living in a remote island that lies away from the major countries in the world Gran is naturally curious about the world that lies beyond his home which is reinforced by the books that he has read as a child. In particular Gran since when he little has dreamed of exploring the skies in an airship of his own a dream that was finally achieved by the journey that he embarked on with Lyria after meeting her. A prominent trait of Gran’s is that Gran seems to prefer to sort out disagreements via peaceful methods through negotiation and is always willing to listen to the viewpoints of all the parties that are involved in it before deciding. As the series progresses Gran noticeably more braver and more determined to protect his friends and allies from harm but at the same time has also become more willing to apply more restraint to his actions and as a result not rush into battles like he did in the past.  Though hinted at in the beginning of the series as the series progresses it becomes apparent that Gran is someone that cares a great deal about friendship and the bonds that he makes with people. This has the effect of making Gran more determined than ever to protect those that are dear to him.Gran’s friendship and unique bond that he shares with Lyria forms a central part of this series and forms part of the main plot. In the beginning of the series Gran and his pet dragon Vyrm encountered Lyria by chance deep in a forest that lay on his island of birth and despite the sudden meeting soon struck up a friendship. As the series progresses and after finding out Lyria’s painful past and childhood Gran becomes more determined to protect her from the empire and at the same time more understanding of her personality and as a result he tries pretty hard to show Lyria how beautiful this world is while at the same time dispelling the effects that her past memories have on her. As a result of a near death experience in the past Gran has rather interesting bond with Lyria in that he’s able to summon powers that are derived from Lyria that can make him more powerful in combat. At the same time on an emotional level Gran is able to deduce and understand the types of thoughts that are going through Lyria’s psyche which is especially important when they are protecting her from the empire’s plans. All in all, I felt that Gran was a pretty well-designed character that though the archetypal good guy proved that if you have both a determination to protect your friends and allies from an enemy that is stronger than you and a will to define the enemies plan then you too can become a hero. Heroes are after all made from a determination to do something extraordinary and I would say standing up to an evil empire to protect your friends and allies more than qualifies Gran as a hero.LyriaLyria voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of Asterisk wars and Gate fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A young teenage girl that has a rather dark and tragic past that has made her life hell the moment that she was born. Personality wise Lyria is an innocent, kind and curious young woman that until she met Gran knew little of the world itself due to being imprisoned by the empire. Initially Lyria’s personality was a bit on the quiet side as besides Katalina Gran and Vyrm were the first people that she met that were friendly to her. But at the same time, she was also curious about the world around her and as a result she and Gran soon struck up a friendship. As the series progresses Lyria noticeably becomes more talkative and at the same time more compassionate towards others and more willing to help others which I believe is something that she learned from Gran. Despite being curious Lyria is someone that always tries to respect local custom and as a result respects the local gods for each area that she visits with the cast. This respect for local customs I felt was well done and in line with her personality. As the series progresses and more and more allies join her and Grans party Lyria is slowly able to come out of her shell by slowly making friends with her new teammates and places an immense level of trust in them something that each of them soon return as well. Lyria’s most prominent trait is without a doubt her compassion towards others as over the course of the series though Lyria and Gran and co encounter many situations where simply eliminating the enemy might have been an easier choice Lyria would often sympathize with the enemy and understand the reasons for their actions which is another thing that I felt really matched her personality of disliking violence. As a result of meeting so many different people and making so many friends one trait that Lyria developed as the series went on was her playfulness which I felt was funny and a sign that her personality really is changing for the better.Despite her brave and positive front however behind this mask of hers one can see that Lyria still wrestles with inner struggles that affect her greatly made even more so because of her somewhat fragile personality. As a result of her friendships and bonds that she has forged with members of her party Lyria is very happy that she has managed to make some friends but at the same time because of her past Lyria fights against the belief that she herself is a burden to her friends and allies a fact that although the cast know about can do little more than try and support her and cheer her up with. This struggle of Lyria that she faces alone is actually tied with Lyria’s role in the overall plot and I thought it was done pretty well. The manner of how this was eventually solved by the cast though I thought was brilliant and heart-warming as it made use of each of the bonds that her friends have established with her to bring her back from despair.As a character, I felt that Lyria was a pretty well-designed character that was developed rather well in the series. Though quiet and somewhat wary of strangers at first it was nice to see Lyria develop into a strong but also compassionate person that cares about her friends and allies and will not let her past dictate her life. The struggles that Lyria in this series I felt was actually pretty well done and it was heart-breaking to see Lyria give in to despair and shut her friends out after being told the truth of her past by the empire. I was glad that in the end that the cast managed to get through to her and bring her back through the bonds and memories that they had with her. I felt that Nao Touyama really did an excellent job portraying Lyria.KatalinaKatalina voiced by veteran seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro of Sword art online 2 and Rokka no Yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Gran and Lyria’s main allies in the series. A veteran knight formerly of the empire Katalina serves as both Lyria’s first friend and also her guardian. As a knight Katalina is a stoic, brave and calm person that is able to stay composed and rationally even when under pressure. Unlike many knights of the empire however Katalina is also compassionate and kind and also honorable which is the prime reason why she decided to leave the empire with Lyria. Even before meeting with Gran and the rest of the cast Katalina and Lyria actually knew each other as she was charged with watching over her. As a result of this duty however Katalina saw first-hand how the empire treated Lyria and as a result caused her to have pity for Lyria and caused her to forge a friendship and bond with her by teaching her about the world. This also served as a catalyst that led to their escape from the empire and the beginning of the main story.As a result of her bond with Lyria Katalina sees herself as her guardian and as a result she takes the safety of Lyria pretty seriously. As a result of this Katalina can be slow to trust strangers and be rather icy towards them but this is something that comes from her determination to protect Lyria from all threats as more than ever Katalina wants Lyria to have a life that can be considered normal for someone her age and not be treated as something that’s not even a human being by the likes of the empire. Personality wise Katalina has what can be considered to be a big sister type personality as she tries to more responsible for the main members of the party much of which are still teenagers though far too often their actions and the results of their actions often instead surprise her instead. Still this side of her personality was interesting to see. A peculiar trait of Katalina is the fact that she seems to adore cute things of which Vyrn is often an unwitting target for her which I found to quite funny. I felt that Miyuki Sawashiro really did a great job of portraying the character of Katalina who despite being a knight that’s both stoic and composed can also be surprisingly compassionate and caring as well.VyrnVyrn voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Kugimiya of elDLIVE and Persona 4 the animation fame is one of the main characters of the show and is one of Gran and Lyria’s main allies. A small flying dragon that’s been with Gran since he was a child Vyrn is a funny creature that’s also shown to be intelligent and compassionate and is also considerate towards the feelings of others. At the same time Vyrn is also shown to be very loyal to both Gran and his friends and always tries to point out the best possible paths for them. Because of his small size Vyrn has limited offensive capabilities but he’s shown to have a large heart and sensitive to the feelings of others that are around him and often tries to cheer them up to the best of his ability. A prominent trait of Vyrn is the fact that he is easily distracted on what is being discussed which is often used as comic relief. Though Vyrn as a character is a relatively small role I felt that Rie Kugimiya really did a great job voicing him.IoIo voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yukari Tamura of Re Zero and Naruto fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Gran and Lyria’s main allies in the series. A young mage from a country that Gran and co visited early in their travels Io is a young teenage girl that despite her young age is actually quite the proficient mage having a variety of spells at her disposal.  Personality wise Io is a kind and caring person that has a positive and bubbly demeanor suitable for her age. Despite that she can also be stubborn and has an interesting trait of not respecting people that should deserve respect as a result of their age. This is most often applied to Rackam who was actually the one that started it in the first-place due to his underestimation of magic that Io wields. Despite her positive and bubbly personality Io as a result of her stubbornness can be overly proud of her abilities but however is not too stubborn to ask for help. As a result of living with only her master since she was little Io is very close to her master values the relationship that he has with him. As a result of living alone for much of her life Io can be slow to trust people and indeed it took her some time to establish a friendship with Gran and the others.  Despite this Io is someone that has a strong sense of justice and can’t stand the sight of innocents being hurt by others and as a result she hates people that do that for whatever reason.  A recurring trait of Io’s that seems to be used for comical effect in this series is that Io hates being seen as a child which she actually is despite the fact that her abilities as a mage certainly match the level of a teenager instead.Like Rackam  Io too has a sub story arc that is used to develop and flesh out her character while also allowing the main cast to get to know her. In the case of Io her sub story arc’s main focus was her attempts to track down the whereabouts of her master who had vanished around the time that Gran and the others had arrived in her home. This story arc I felt was actually well done as it showed just how much trust Io had in her master having known him for a number of years and proves that if someone that you known begins to act out of character then they are lightly being controlled by something or someone. Seeing Io be able to deduce this and see her refusing to give up on him was something that I thought was nicely done and showed just how close they were. I was really glad that her arc resulted in the freeing of her master from the mind control though. All in all, I felt that Io was a pretty well-designed character that showed that despite her young age that she was still capable of casting complex magic attack spells that could exceed the attack power of adults like Rackam. At the same time, it was also nice that despite her slow to trust nature Io was able to form a friendship with people that are more along her age like Lyria and Gran. Although Rackam and Io did not get on with in the beginning it was nice that by the end of the series that both have managed to develop an element of trust in each other. All in all, I felt that Yukari Tamura really did a great job in voicing Io.RosettaRosetta played by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Tanaka is one of the main support characters of the show and one of Gran and Lyria’s main allies. A mysterious female mage that’s been helping the party since the beginning Rosetta is an enigmatic and mysterious mage that seems to know many secrets about both the empire’s plans and also about their many experiments but likes to hold these back for the opportune time to tell anyone. Despite her mysterious nature that many would argue would make her untrustworthy Rosetta doesn’t seem to let this bother her as she is shown to be able to deflect suspicion that others have on her with humor which I felt was interesting. Despite her enigmatic nature when Rosetta interacts with Gran and co it can be seen that Rosetta actually has a kind and caring personality while also being intelligent and well read. Rosetta has shown to be a powerful mage as she is able to intervene in various actions without being discovered with her most notable feat of being on hand to rescue the cast from a tidal wave. Although not featured until near the end of the series I felt that Rosetta was a pretty interesting character and that her seiyuu Rie Tanaka really did a great job in voicing her. I do feel that she along with a number of other support characters could have been brought into the story a bit earlier though.EugenEugen voiced by veteran voice actor Kazuhiro Yamaji is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Gran and Lyria’s allies in the series. A mid aged man that lives in the chain of islands that forms the island nation Eugen is an old friend of Rackam and both were helmsman in the past before they went their separate ways. A veteran adventurer that has great skill in the use of firearms that is best shown in the final battles of the series Eugen is highly regarded and respected in his home town of Auguste and you can see that the people there really look to up to him for advice and guidance. Personality wise Eugen is a brave and wise person that’s also fast on his feet and is able to easily adapt to different situations on the field. Eugen is also a dependable person and is shown to be very loyal to the people that live in his hometown willing to put himself in harm’s way to protect them. The character of Eugen I felt was an interesting character as he brought a lot of experience to the cast which until his introduction was mainly provided by Katalina and Rackam. The rapport that Eugen and Rackam had was also interesting to see and it was nice to see them use this during combat as well.RackamRackam voiced by veteran voice actor Hiroaki Hirata of Digimon fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Gran and Lyria’s main allies. A talented helmsman and a capable mechanic Gran and Lyria encounter Rackam early on in their journey. When they were both looking for an airship and someone to fly it. Personality wise Rackam is a relatively cheerful and carefree person at first glance but he’s also one that’s very single minded with his tasks and will often spend a lot of time on repairing something as can be expected from a mechanic. Although not one to trust people easily Rackam is also someone that values honesty and truth above all else and will not hesitate to help those in need even if it meant facing steep odds. Although disbelieving of Lyria and Grans powers at first Rackam soon become a believer after seeing them manage to subdue a deity that was attacking the very island that he had lived on his whole life. As a result of his easy-going nature Rackam is able to forge a bond of friendship with Gran and the rest of the cast quite easily and as the series progresses Rackam is shown to become very loyal to his friends and determined to help them in their journey.

These two concepts are the ideas of identity and freedom.

It creates some of the most spectacular settings, worlds full of wonder and amazement, creatures that we could only imagine come to life to take us on an adventure that we could only dream about, we witness epic events unfold before our very eyes as huge monsters fight a group of adventurers that are ready to take it on. Granblue Fantasy is definitely an adventure that encapsulates all of that, amongst many other things that make fantasy so great, not to mention that thanks to some great directing and stellar action sequences, the people over at A-1 were able...to put together some of the most pleasant and wonderful anime in recent memory.*Spoilers included*Gran is a simple boy. He lives his day on one of the floating islands with his pet Vyrn and dreams of becoming a captain that could one day venture into the unknown world on his own ship, with his own crew, and find his father that sent him a letter from a legendary island back in the day. The opportunity for such an endeavor arises when an object flies from the skies right into the middle of a forest near Gran\'s house. That object turns out to be a girl, more specifically: Lyria, a government experiment that\'s been hid in special facilities until she was rescued by her guard Katalina. After defending themselves from the knights chasing her for a while, Gran get struck down and dies. Thankfully, he is able to return to the world of living thanks to Lyria, who shared her life force with him. They summon the powerful dragon Bahamut and chase away the intruders, after which all of them quickly decide to leave together, Gran with the intention of fulfilling his dream and defending the newly met girl, and Lyria with the intent of understanding her reason for living. On their journeys they meet new adventurers, some of which join their crew, discover new lands, some of which they have to save, and uncover the corrupt reality that was created by the ruling force: the Empire.First let me pose a question: What\'s the most important part of an adventure in a piece of fiction? To me, it all comes down to a couple of things: What kind of people do you follow, what places do they visit, what kind of cool experiences they go through and how far can my imagination reach with the presented setting. I""m going to tackle each of those elements.Granblue Fantasy is set in a universe where people are constrained by the place they live in, that being a flying island, with the only means of travel being airships. People who fly on those vehicles are called skyfarers. The world is mostly ruled by the Empire that tries to become even stronger and expand even further, but there are still islands that oppose them.At the start of the story, we are presented to a small chunk of the world, the cookie-cutter island where Gran lives. We see boring, normal houses, with a boring, normal forest and other boring, normal places. This helps with building up the excitement for the moment where the viewer first hears of a greater prospects, a huge, open world with numerous beautiful islands full of life and mystery, legendary islands and adventurers traversing the wide, blue skies on huge airships to find fame and treasure. That doesn\'t mean that the show is boring at the beginning though, there\'s a lot of movement and despite the fact that the first island isn\'t as rich as the ones we see later, the build up and the actions that take place during the first act are enough to take your mind off of that.At a certain point the characters start traveling, the first time we see them fly an airship, it\'s a small, crappy machine that nobody actually knows how to fly. As such, we get to see very little of the beautiful sky or the important parts of piloting and traveling, however, the second island is already much more spacious and bright. It starts filling the void that the first island left. That\'s only the beginning though.The world of Granblue Fantasy is huge and epic, each island is characterized by it\'s own architecture and color pallet, each has its own purpose and different types of merchants and craftsmen. For example the second island is full of skyfarers and the entire place is dedicated to a Sky Goddess Tiamat. Another one is full of mechanical craft, or another one that\'s dedicated to water and looks like Venice on steroids.Creating a vast and imaginatively impelling world allows this show to put in new things at will, but also makes the viewer more interested in new arcs. The camera placement surely helps with that, there\'s a lot of wide, expository shots that give the viewer a sense of space, creating a place that you can comprehend and see how it works, by that I mean both how nature does its own things and how busy towns, inns and shops work on a daily basis. As such, this series has successfully created a living, vibrant world that allows for endless fanfictions to be based upon it, which is a huge success on its own, but that\'s not the end of this show\'s strengths.The world is created only to be explored, and that can\'t be done without characters, so let\'s take a quick look at them.Gran works pretty well as a self-insert protagonist, but unfortunately not much more. His ideals, morals and dreams are all fairly simple, the show made sure to put them out there. However, the show itself takes the stance of Gran every single time, it lacks a gray area that could separate Gran from the viewer\'s understanding of the world, thus making him the self-insert MC. Every directing trick and each camera shot is supposed to reflect on Gran\'s mindset so the viewer naturally follows it. Still, that\'s not the worst thing in the world. The character interactions between Gran and others feel more real this way, his ideals of wanting to meet his father and just be an adventurers are actually invigorating and make him almost feel like his own character, not quite making it in the end for me.Lyria is an experimental being that stores a deadly power. She holds different beings inside of her, most of which are deadly. In the wrong hands, she can be used for evil, she\'s pretty much a walking political pawn, a weapon that was supposed to be used just as that. However, thanks to Gran who she quickly connects with, she finally considers herself to be a person, a human being with emotions and personality. Not only that, but on her journeys, she discovers that she can help Primal Beasts, powerful beings that are being used by the Empire. That\'s the first step for the process of discovering herself, that slowly becomes the main theme of the show. It gets interrupted later on, which leads to a great scene in episode 11 as Gran ventures inside of her mind to search for her sanity and ends up winning her over with charisma and by bringing up the progress she already made. She\'s a solid heroine, works well with Gran, who\'s characterization is on the low side, and makes for someone worth defending, weak at first serving only as support without any offensive capabilities of her own, but one that\'s getting stronger and smarter with each new adventure.Katalina, who was Lyria\'s guard when she was still in the hands of the Empire, feels like a mother to the group of teens that don\'t really know what\'s going on. Incredibly strong and swift in battle, she\'s also very level-headed. She does a good job at contrasting with the rest of the rather rash cast, but unfortunately that\'s about it. Seems a bit lacking, especially if you consider the amount of time she\'s on the screen and her level of importance to Lyria.Rackam is the first person the crew meets after leaving the first island. He\'s a helmsman who hasn\'t piloted a ship since youth. He dedicated his entire life to repairing a single ship, but somehow he doesn\'t seem to remember that once he is able to start it with Gran on board. The problem with his character is that, while he spent so much effort on this one ship, after his arc is done, he quickly forget about it and shows no affection to it when adventuring later on. This could be a good plot point, the fact that his travels would bring him peace and make him feel fulfillment or some sort of a justification for his actions, but no, there\'s nothing like that. However, his interactions with other characters are well written and likable. If Katalina is a mother of the children, he\'s definitely the cheeky, yet smart older brother. The thing that makes him a well thought out addition is the incredible resolve that kept him from flying on other airships, and if you remember, flying is something Gran always dreamed about since childhood. It makes a strong point about how larger the world truly is, with all sorts of different people, completely different from the ones that we\'ve seen in Gran\'s village. Just imagine finally leaving your small piece of land after all this imagining of how it would be to fly free, and the first person you meet is someone who neglects your life-long dream by wanting to fly on only one specific machine.The next person that joins the crew is Io: a young mage. Thanks to her cheerful, somewhat childish yet clever and dedicated personality, an interesting backstory and a simple motivation, she balances out the cast rather well. After all, the last addition was Rackam who she refers to as ""old man"". She may not be on the screen so much and her characterization may have become stale after her arc, but she does bring some extra life by being another person to join the bunch, and quite the presence when she does get some time.Towards the end of this season we also get to meet Eugen who later joins the crew, though we don\'t see much of that. He\'s Rackam\'s old friend and when we see him for the first time, he is helping the water island stand on its own two feet after some natural disasters occur. He\'s a good leader, calm and collected, but he likes to let loose once in a while and drink beer when the time is right. He is surely the oldest crew member, thus giving him the title of the crew\'s grandpa feels appropriate. After all, he\'s an experienced skyfarer and a good shot.So overall, the crew is diverse and fun to follow, while certain interactions unfortunately are a bit neglected, there are other strong relationships that carry the cast forward. The writing for the dialogues between then isn\'t particularly good, barely does it\'s job, but during fights that require some tactical approach or even ones that don\'t, you can see how well can they work together, the best example being the small ruin exploration quest in episode 8, where some great fight scripting and some proper banter between characters proves my point.In episode 12 a lot of other adventurers come to save a city with Gran and others, and while this could be seen as a missed opportunity, I think it didn\'t affect the flow or atmosphere of the series negatively, instead it made it feel even more alive. Adventurers would join a battle if they saw a chance, they would show off a lot and help the weaker city defend itself. I\'m sure this was just an attempt to force in some characters from the game this show is based off of, but it laid out another part of the world and added some depth to it.The villains are not the stronger part of the series, they mostly create some inconveniences that end up helping the team find the Primal Beasts faster, or they just stand around and act mysterious. That\'s not a good thing, it feels sort of lazy, but then again, having a big villain right out the gate would most likely ruin the feeling of audacity that comes from all the experiences that were about to happen. However, if that\'s the case, the series shouldn\'t be afraid to hide its characters. It showed previously that it can take risks and do random things to consolidate that feeling in episode 4, when Rackam\'s airship miraculously started working after all that time, so why not do that again and insert those character later? There\'s very little reason for them to be present so far.So, for the second point of my own version of ""How to make an adventure series for dummies"", the characters you follow do their job well because they have very specified roles to fulfill both in casual and relaxed moments and during fights, they coordinate well and work off of each other surprisingly naturally, but they are definitely far from being the most impressive thing about the show. That title would have to go to the audiovisual side of things.No matter how much you try, no matter how much you struggle, you can\'t have a proper feeling of amazement and wonder in adventure series without some good looking locations and designs, and if there\'s something that Granblue nails almost perfectly, then this is it. The world itself looks stunning, the previously mentioned wide camera shots, the stunningly bright and expressive color pallet, the diverse and interesting architecture are only a part of it. Take a look at the CGI in this show, look at how well it blends in thanks to other special effects that are on the screen, such as fog, clouds and other similar things. Look at the moving skies in the background. Look at the natural facial expressions and movement. Most importantly though, look at the character designs, as they seamlessly bring back the old look, the RPG look of fantasy that went a bit missing during the moe era. I mean, it\'s still visible, but there are things that help with it. Proper armor designs are one of those, but another is the lack of consistently distinct outlines, which allows for a much more expressive facial movement and additional elements that could be added around it without the need to draw those lines at all times. Shots like Rackam pulling out his gun in episode 4 as Gran is being threatened looks so well, because the outlines of the said gun almost fill in the lack of such on his face. It looks great!The  designs work well with the sound, as both are directed extremely well. You can often hear the sound of armor moving when characters run, the wind and other natural effects sound wonderfully real, it\'s as if they embrace you from all sounds. The music doesn\'t lag behind either. Do you know who composed the music for Granblue Fantasy?Nobuo fucking Uematsu.Do you know what else did Nobuo Uematsu compose for?FINAL FUCKING FANTASY II-XI AND CHRONO TRIGGER!If someone knows how to compose music for fantasy, it\'s this guy. He\'s a master that should be celebrated much more than he already is, but thanks to his work, Granblue Fantasy gets this much better. All the tracks are magical, enticing and special in their own way, but I have to give credit to the people who utilized them, as they did a great job. The background music often helps to create the mood and even indicate the tempo of a conversation during the not especially well written dialogues, the battle music is epic enough and picks up at just the right moments. It feels like most of the scenes were created for the music, as they probably should.So, this series looks and sounds amazing, but how about the fights? That\'s also pretty important. Well, I\'m happy to say that this series has a properly established battle system with a good diversity in weapons and some cool additions as it goes on. There are sword users that rely mostly on their strength, such as Gran, swordsmen that utilize magic and agility, such as Katalina, mages, such as Io, and sharpshooters (using big ass guns!), such as Rackam and Eugen. There\'s also the support - Lyria - who uses her powers too boost attacks of others, and later she learns how to summon the Primal Beasts she helped, which is sweet seeing as their designs are also great, they look strong and threatening from the first glance.Well, the animation for the most part could be clearer and more refined, there are some shots where the characters almost look like they\'re different people (probably different episode directors), but I have to say that the squashing and stretching works really well in some sequences, like Gran running on broken pieces of land in episode 5. They look spectacular, perfectly flashy and fluid, with some creative camera angles and movement, such as a top down perspective while Gran was flying down onto the Primal Beast in the same episode.The scripts for the fights are well done, with some of the craziest idea I\'ve seen in a while. Example: dunking a bomb into a golem\'s mouth. If that\'s not enough to sell you, then let me also mention that during fights, each character has a purpose of their own, magic works differently on some enemies, so different types have to be used, guns are less effective on armored people, but they sure can knock them back a bit, close quarter combat isn\'t the smartest against a strong foe, but nailing in that one specific, powered up attack will lead to victory. Stuff like that, consistent yet fresh animation, sound and scripting, is what elevates this show higher than other, similar shows.However, the last episode caught me a bit off guard. It features a new MC called Djeeta, who I only assume is the female counterpart of the Gran from the game, and it introduces new crew members joining alongside, which I also assume are from the game going to the beach to rest. I would be annoyed if not for the fact that it\'s probably one of my favorite beach episodes of all time, featuring a clear narrative and just the same amount of adventure, but with some more cute girls, some good comedy and the heroine that\'s pretty overpowered compared to Gran. It seems to take place far from the events that we see in the show. Consider it as an OVA and a nod for the fans, it doesn\'t belong in the actual season for sure, but where else would they include if there\'s no manga that it\'s based off, there\'s only a mobile game. If there\'s nothing to attach such an episode to, I\'m glad that I at least got it in this form. Entirely skippable, but pleasant nonethelessLeft this for the end because I didn\'t want to disrupt the flow of the review, but I want to talk about the opening and the ending, which also strengthen the adventure feeling when you start up an episode. Thanks to some amazing transitioning and the way it works with the music, the opening creates the feeling on its own almost immediately, there\'s a lot of atmospheric shots and play with shadows, but it all ends on a positive note with the airship leaving on a blue sky. The ending, while consisting of a lot of still shots, adds a bit more positivity into the mix. Starts off with Lyria standing on the edge of a cliff with her hair blowing, transitions to worried Fran  and Vyrn looking on a dark night, after which we see all the characters smiling to the camera and both of the main pair joining them for a final happy shot. The music in both is seriously amazing and climatic, but the opening uses the most popular song by the well known band Bump Of Chicken called ""Go"", and nobody can rival that.Granblue Fantasy is the epitome of adventure, a damn near perfect combination of atmosphere and world building that turned it into one of the seasonal highlights. Despite the lack of a strong, impactful cast and it\'s rather simplistic storyline, this show really gets things done, and it does so incredibly well. Want to sit down, relax and live out a different, more fantastical story in a form of a Japanese cartoon for a while? If so, this is your fix. I highly recommend it as such.As always, this is purely my opinion. I recommend you to develop your own. to put together some of the most pleasant and wonderful anime in recent memory.*Spoilers included*Gran is a simple boy. He lives his day on one of the floating islands with his pet Vyrn and dreams of becoming a captain that could one day venture into the unknown world on his own ship, with his own crew, and find his father that sent him a letter from a legendary island back in the day. The opportunity for such an endeavor arises when an object flies from the skies right into the middle of a forest near Gran\'s house. That object turns out to be a girl, more specifically: Lyria, a government experiment that\'s been hid in special facilities until she was rescued by her guard Katalina. After defending themselves from the knights chasing her for a while, Gran get struck down and dies. Thankfully, he is able to return to the world of living thanks to Lyria, who shared her life force with him. They summon the powerful dragon Bahamut and chase away the intruders, after which all of them quickly decide to leave together, Gran with the intention of fulfilling his dream and defending the newly met girl, and Lyria with the intent of understanding her reason for living. On their journeys they meet new adventurers, some of which join their crew, discover new lands, some of which they have to save, and uncover the corrupt reality that was created by the ruling force: the Empire.First let me pose a question: What\'s the most important part of an adventure in a piece of fiction? To me, it all comes down to a couple of things: What kind of people do you follow, what places do they visit, what kind of cool experiences they go through and how far can my imagination reach with the presented setting. I""m going to tackle each of those elements.Granblue Fantasy is set in a universe where people are constrained by the place they live in, that being a flying island, with the only means of travel being airships. People who fly on those vehicles are called skyfarers. The world is mostly ruled by the Empire that tries to become even stronger and expand even further, but there are still islands that oppose them.At the start of the story, we are presented to a small chunk of the world, the cookie-cutter island where Gran lives. We see boring, normal houses, with a boring, normal forest and other boring, normal places. This helps with building up the excitement for the moment where the viewer first hears of a greater prospects, a huge, open world with numerous beautiful islands full of life and mystery, legendary islands and adventurers traversing the wide, blue skies on huge airships to find fame and treasure. That doesn\'t mean that the show is boring at the beginning though, there\'s a lot of movement and despite the fact that the first island isn\'t as rich as the ones we see later, the build up and the actions that take place during the first act are enough to take your mind off of that.At a certain point the characters start traveling, the first time we see them fly an airship, it\'s a small, crappy machine that nobody actually knows how to fly. As such, we get to see very little of the beautiful sky or the important parts of piloting and traveling, however, the second island is already much more spacious and bright. It starts filling the void that the first island left. That\'s only the beginning though.The world of Granblue Fantasy is huge and epic, each island is characterized by it\'s own architecture and color pallet, each has its own purpose and different types of merchants and craftsmen. For example the second island is full of skyfarers and the entire place is dedicated to a Sky Goddess Tiamat. Another one is full of mechanical craft, or another one that\'s dedicated to water and looks like Venice on steroids.Creating a vast and imaginatively impelling world allows this show to put in new things at will, but also makes the viewer more interested in new arcs. The camera placement surely helps with that, there\'s a lot of wide, expository shots that give the viewer a sense of space, creating a place that you can comprehend and see how it works, by that I mean both how nature does its own things and how busy towns, inns and shops work on a daily basis. As such, this series has successfully created a living, vibrant world that allows for endless fanfictions to be based upon it, which is a huge success on its own, but that\'s not the end of this show\'s strengths.The world is created only to be explored, and that can\'t be done without characters, so let\'s take a quick look at them.Gran works pretty well as a self-insert protagonist, but unfortunately not much more. His ideals, morals and dreams are all fairly simple, the show made sure to put them out there. However, the show itself takes the stance of Gran every single time, it lacks a gray area that could separate Gran from the viewer\'s understanding of the world, thus making him the self-insert MC. Every directing trick and each camera shot is supposed to reflect on Gran\'s mindset so the viewer naturally follows it. Still, that\'s not the worst thing in the world. The character interactions between Gran and others feel more real this way, his ideals of wanting to meet his father and just be an adventurers are actually invigorating and make him almost feel like his own character, not quite making it in the end for me.Lyria is an experimental being that stores a deadly power. She holds different beings inside of her, most of which are deadly. In the wrong hands, she can be used for evil, she\'s pretty much a walking political pawn, a weapon that was supposed to be used just as that. However, thanks to Gran who she quickly connects with, she finally considers herself to be a person, a human being with emotions and personality. Not only that, but on her journeys, she discovers that she can help Primal Beasts, powerful beings that are being used by the Empire. That\'s the first step for the process of discovering herself, that slowly becomes the main theme of the show. It gets interrupted later on, which leads to a great scene in episode 11 as Gran ventures inside of her mind to search for her sanity and ends up winning her over with charisma and by bringing up the progress she already made. She\'s a solid heroine, works well with Gran, who\'s characterization is on the low side, and makes for someone worth defending, weak at first serving only as support without any offensive capabilities of her own, but one that\'s getting stronger and smarter with each new adventure.Katalina, who was Lyria\'s guard when she was still in the hands of the Empire, feels like a mother to the group of teens that don\'t really know what\'s going on. Incredibly strong and swift in battle, she\'s also very level-headed. She does a good job at contrasting with the rest of the rather rash cast, but unfortunately that\'s about it. Seems a bit lacking, especially if you consider the amount of time she\'s on the screen and her level of importance to Lyria.Rackam is the first person the crew meets after leaving the first island.

Whether it be through the character animation, like in One Punch Man, or through its overall art and world style. I also appreciate a good story and lovely characters, but first and foremost I look for beauty in animation and art. It's a bonus if I get the good story and characters.Granblue Fantasy is absolutely beautiful to watch. Visually. The scenes are as if they're straight out of a painting, and the characters and...creatures never move awkwardly, all throughout the anime. You know what I'm talking about: anime that are only animated well for the first few episodes and for the rest of the season are lifeless caricatures that can talk (Masamune-kun no Revenge), or are never animated all that well in the first place (Getsuyoubi no Tawawa, but don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, although for reasons I will not state here).Its story isn't really a novel one. Its characters really aren't fleshed out, but there isn't any need for them to be for me to enjoy this anime. The character chemistry isn't bad, but again it's pretty basic (see what I did there?)In conclusion, if you're like me, and your idea of a good time is watching anime that are well-done visually, give Granblue Fantasy a shot. I recommend watching it on a large screen.But if you're looking for anime that'll tickle your funny bone, or make you fall in love with the characters, or get your mind up and running, or give you a completely new sense of perspective---you might wanna pass on Granblue Fantasy. creatures never move awkwardly, all throughout the anime.

LA does say this as many of the early plot beats to...elements has similarities to Final Fantasy, such as a mysterious girl with some power that the empire wants can be contributed to Terra from FFVI, the world of Granblue Fantasy: The Animation is similar to FFXII in this regard due to the sky islands and skyfarers (to heck even an airship the main cast travels in) and all this in mind LA did still enjoy Granblue Fantasy: The Animation because of it.LA would like to get some of the bad points about Granblue Fantasy: The Animation out of the way first and the most obvious one is that at times Granblue Fantasy: The Animation breaks the immersion your in their world by having quest-givers like Sierokarte voiced by Emiri Katou blatantly giving the main cast something to do and she\'s essentially your shop keep, quest giver and is ALWAYS near a town, it\'s not a completely bad thing to have Sierokarte as it\'s paying homage to the game\'s plot, LA just wished she could have been a bit more subtle. The next obvious problem is that Granblue Fantasy: The Animation\'s villain roster of Pommern and Furias are just stock bad guy material with nothing about them giving us any kind of sympathy for them. They\'re essentially Kefka without the motivation, just destroy because ""we\'re evil"", there ARE some legitimately good villains in Granblue Fantasy: The Animation but the majority of the screentime goes to Pommern which quite honestly sucks.Granblue Fantasy: The Animation\'s sense of adventure is prevalent in this anime and even though Granblue Fantasy: The Animation is pretty much taking cues from it\'s source material (it\'s mobile browser game) it does it in a way that actually allows the characters to be their own characters and develops the world alongside the characters and the places they visit making this anime an easy shoe-in for GOOD video game to anime adaptations LA has seen in quite a while.The plot of Granblue Fantasy: The Animation follows Gran...or Djeeta who wants to travel the world and find his long lost father somewhere outside of his sky island continent, however when the Empire strikes his/her hometown, he comes across Kataline Alize voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro and a mysterious blue haired girl by the name of Lyria voiced by Nao Touyama and from there, their adventure begins by trying to find Gran\'s father and both fleeing and confronting the Evil Empire as to why they want Lyria and who Lyria really is. Yes it\'s cliched classic adventure story but again for having likings to Final Fantasy alot and the fact the characters are enjoyable to watch individually as well as a group dynamic allows this anime\'s plot to be more than just cliched and harkens back to the classic JRPG era just in anime form.As for characters, like a classic JRPG, Gran\'s motley crew does expand as they continue on their travels and meet new people, such staples becomes Rackam voiced by Hiroaki Hirata the pilot of their airship, Io voiced by Yukari Tamura, the mage of the group and local tsundere to Rackam, Vyrn voiced by Rie Kugimiya, the mascot of the game and anime and Gran\'s best friend as well as the aforementioned Katalina and Lyria but later on their cast grows exponentially after the Leviathan incident. Ohh yeah did LA forget theirs summons in this anime because there\'s summons in this anime and the classic Square Enix ones like Bahamut, Tiamat, the aforementioned Leviathan and Colossus (which might as well be a Steel Titan). LA\'s favourite character in Granblue Fantasy: The Animation easily goes to Lyria due to her importance to the plot and the fact that Nao Touyama voiced her...no LA is serious that\'s the reasons why.In terms of animation by A1-Pictures, LA REALLY loved the art style of this anime outright from it\'s watercolored yet pastel sketchbook style of it all that also blends to it\'s character designs in with Toshifumi Akai of Kokoro Connect character designs to make this one of the more strikely different art styles of Spring 2017 and it again being similar to the mobile game\'s art style helps and LA just loves it. The battle scenes also gets a huge boost to this animation style as well, making the battles especially the summons and their ""attacks"" gorgeously destructive to watch. If your in it for the animation then Granblue Fantasy: The Animation doesn\'t hold back.In terms of voice acting, the voice acting is decent overall with stellar voice cast as Miyuki Sawashiro as Katalina and Nao Touyama as Lyria, Rie Tanaka as Rosetta to HECK even Yukari Tamura as Io, this voice cast roster is just amazing! If LA had to choose who is LA\'s favourite voice actor it would go to Miyuki Sawashiro as Katalina wasn\'t only a badass but just as a character alone made Miyuki Sawashiro\'s performance all the more better for her, next to that goes to Nao Touyama as Lyria and LA being a Nao Touyama fanboy it was inevitable she would get first or second billing in LA\'s eyes.Considering LA did play a bit of the mobile browser game due to the anime coming out and caught LA\'s curiosity, LA does approve of the pacing the anime did with it allowing both the characters and it\'s world to flourish together and making the fantasy and adventure aspects all the more prominent in the process. The ONE surprise LA wasn\'t expecting was that in the final episode that Gran would be replaced with Djeeta (the female avatar of the game and as if Djeeta did the same thing that Gran went through in a weird alternative reality) and the fact that she like Gran is similar but with less shits to give when it came to the Empire and Djeeta herself having her own personality and ""even the girls loves her"" scthick to her, the final episode was a good send up to a mobile browser game that essentially will never end so ending in the fanservice ""beach"" episode was a nice way to end the series instead of saying ""play the game"". Anyways off tangent but nonetheless the final homage to the game is the gacha systeming of getting new crew members and although it\'s vaguely shown to us, the additional cast members of the game does appear in a cameo during the Leviathan incident as well as the final episode.

There's something in it that's drew me in. I like the art design. I liked the promise of adventure and seeing new sights, which it fulfilled to some degree. I liked the few moments of action in between the long - and I mean long - transition of exposition between scenes.And that's where GBF:TA falls flat. In spite of its surface beauty and promise of adventure, it just kind of drags along from point A to point B with...no true feeling of tension or gravitas. The characters feel dry and underdeveloped, lacking anything that would make you relate to any of them... although strangely enough, the one character that really truly feels developed is actually an alternate gender-bent version of the main character in the last episode - and that is JARRING.It has potential, but just lacks tension, substance and character. It's like biting into a really nice looking piece of chocolate and expecting a delicious filling of some kind, only to find out the chocolate is hollow. It was somewhat tasty at first bite, but leaves you yearning for more.As it stands, GBF:TA is a lesson of how to avoid writing a disengaging script for an anime.

Right now I\'m thinking on dropping the anime, why you may think ?It\'s pretty simple, while the characters are simple and the plot is cliche, the anime wasn\'t able to grab me by the guts. I believe it lacks information about the world the story is occurring and some character background. The important thing I noticed from my experience is that I wasn\'t fired up by the story/plot which is why I am writing this now. Let\'s take some other anime example, Attack on titan, Naruto and umm erased yeah. In either of...these 3 animes the story got my mind stuck on it, willing to know what would happen next, how would the story progress or how will a fight turn out ? Sure, Granblue Fantasy is no drama, it\'s more like a soft adventure medieval fantasy anime, kids could easily watch it and dream about how amazing the MC is strong. But me ? I\'m 21 years old I can see the story is obvious and the lack of information/details just doesn\'t make me curious anymore.Let\'s make some comparison (Spoiler alert)In Naruto, or even attack on titan when we speak about fights we sure as hell ain\'t lacking information about combat techniques, even if it makes sense or not, they gave us a reason to reflect on these aspect of the anime and so we can be like « Oh, this is why...»But in Granblue Fantasy ? Heck no. The MC gets half of the power of the blue haired girl to revive him and is somewhat a part of her but in no way they give us any explanations on how can he exploit/use that power, what is it\'s limit ? What can he do with it exactly ? Why can he kick soldiers\'s butt ? How did he learn to be better than them ? From who ? And first of all who the fuck is that blue haired girl except the fact that she\'s been jailed all this time and she\'s ""special"".I\'m repeating a bit myself but I guess you get the point.Next part will speak about the fact that Granblue isn\'t making me intrigued/curious about what\'s going to happen. For this part I\'ll use Erased as example.In Erased, the more I progressed in it, the more I wanted to know what would happen next ? There was a strong sens of mystery who would keep me on edge and make my brain heat trying to anticipate what would happen next. While I agree Erased is mainly about mystery and of course had characters I wanted to seek out for, drama, I simply believe that Granblue could have used a better shaped mystery rather than some old fucktard father who went to some Island who apparently had another specie, and of course left his son/wife alone behind like he doesn\'t give a fuck.It sure sucks to be the MC when your father leaves you behind and simply leaves you a letter that says « Sup boi, I\'m on that Island, come, I\'m waitin\' for ya\'». At this point I wonder how desperate the MC is to track down that kind of father.Putting the poor character and story development aside,  I think the music was good ? I\'ll be honest I hardly pay attention to musics in any kind of anime I guess the musics aren\'t good nor bad because I didn\'t get to really notice them. (While watching Anime, my brain sort of turns off and I just absorb what\'s happening... and still..)For the art, I\'d say it\'s pretty good, I don\'t have complains about it, the choice fits very well the universe (At least of what we know and can see..)So in the end, I simply believe I\'m too old for this anime, maybe some kids or some people who don\'t especially like to be fed with complex background/lore could easily enjoy this, but not me.Before ending everything, I just wanted to make you notice something about Granblue fantasy.

So, here I go. I may be a bit too gentle, since I can be pretty optimistic - however, please note that this does not mean I can\'t see what is wrong. My rating takes into account the effort put into the anime.Story - 6If I have to summarize the story in one sentence, it would be that it\'s the story of...your typical male protagonist going on an adventure with the main heroine and the usual cute mascot in order to accomplish his dreams. (No, I did not forget Katalina, I actually love her best in all of this. I just didn\'t know how to describe her. Erm. Moving on.)On that part, there\'s nothing much to say. It can be pretty annoying to have the same basic plot for hundreds of anime/manga/etc. but even though it\'s something we keep on seeing, guess what ? It works anyway ; since it only is the basics, it doesn\'t mean the rest is bad.However, from how far it went (and by that I mean until the 9th episode, as I am writing after watching it), it still affects the story, that is with the small parts (that doesn\'t seem like much but can affect the story anyway) that are as clichéd. Be it the main hero throwing himself in death\'s jaws, or developing romantic feelings for the main heroine - and, well, some of you may wonder ""hey, they don\'t have feelings for each other, what are you talking about ?"" ; I actually don\'t know myself - and the producers probably don\'t as well ... -, but some parts really make you think that because of how stereotypical some situations can be - and lead to these kind of interpretations. So much that it can be painful to watch when you\'re used to these things, actually.However, if I make a comparison to the game, the story is the same - they did try to respect the original thing. Well, if we put aside the fact that Gran have better interaction than in the game - which is, of course, obvious ... - and that there are less stereotypical things - trust me, a certain fight in a certain port is less, let\'s say, ""risky"" in the game than in the anime. Which is nice, since it can be pretty difficult to make an anime out of a game, especially if said game can be personalized.Art - 7Granblue Fantasy as a game has one of the best artstyle I\'ve ever seen. It fits pretty well to the genre, and gives to the game its own identity. Be it the monsters or the characters in themselves, each one of them is detailed and simply stunning.Like I said for the story, they made efforts to be as close as possible to the game ; the same seems to go with the art. However, it is less detailed, and can, sometimes, seem untidy - which can be comprehensible, since not only are there the many problems about the anime industry, but also the basic quality of the original art may be too much to make an anime with.In a way, it lost one of its qualities, but kept it at the same time... Which can be weird.Sound - 8According to my good friend Google, Nobuo Uematsu - the same guy that did the music in Final Fantasy, yay ! - participated in the making of the music. Which is, in my opinion, nice. Really nice. I am not a great fan of him, but his work sure does give the right feeling, the right impression, that makes things much better. So, I won\'t say much on this part, except that the music is one of the best points of the game, and of the anime as well - though the opening/ending theme songs aren\'t particularily noticeable...Character - 5The characters ... Well, I did wrote in the Story part how stereotypical they can be, and, yes, Gran probably is the most typical protagonist, with Vyrn/Vee being the usual mascot as well. However, Gran being sort of basic, unoriginal, is the result of being the representation of the player - as such, he was, sort of, forced to be this way - not like the Admiral in Kantai Collection, which does not hold as much importance as Gran in their story. Wouldn\'t it be weird to give a well developed personality to a character you usually play depending on your own choices ? Making them the exact opposite of what they were created for - that is being identified with the player ?  Probably.Also, that may be me whining, but using Djeeta (the female counterpart of Gran) would\'ve been a better idea - there\'d be less clichés.Concerning the other characters, the problem is that they aren\'t much developed as well. They have their own identities, their own tastes, principles, values, however there\'s no place for them in the anime to develop them, which is saddening. We have plenty of opportunities to know them better in the game - with the Fate Episodes, which are sort of small skits you can unlock with the summoning of weapons and addition of the characters in your party. But since the anime is so short, and doesn\'t leave much for additional content aside from the game, we only know the character from their surface - as if it\'s only an introduction.Enjoyment - 7I have been saying a lot of bad things about the anime. Be it painful to watch, too stereotypical, not developed enough ... Yet, I think it is enjoyable. It can, sometimes, be predictable - way too predictable. And some moments can just be ... meh. But it\'s still enjoyable : if you don\'t think much about it, if you only watch it to pass time, or aren\'t acquaintanced enough with all the overused tropes, it can be enjoyable.Overall - 7Granblue Fantasy is a game. Before being an anime, it\'s a game, that reached over 14 millions players. The community around it is slowly growing, with the possibility to play it on computer - and in English. And the reason why an anime was made ? In my opinion, it would be to introduce the game to potential new players - or to please the people that are already playing it, by being able to see an anime out of it - see the characters they may love moving around ; having life given to them.The story, the art, the music : everything is made to fit to the beginning of the game. In other words, you watch it to be introduced to an entire universe, that you can discover by playing it. And they did a great job at that, at least on me : it\'s thanks to the fanarts and doujins that I discovered it and wanted to play it, but the anime confirmed my decision about it.In conclusion, I\'d recommend the anime for all the people who want to be introduced and know a bit about Granblue before trying the game, or for those who already play it. your typical male protagonist going on an adventure with the main heroine and the usual cute mascot in order to accomplish his dreams. (No, I did not forget Katalina, I actually love her best in all of this. I just didn\'t know how to describe her. Erm. Moving on.)On that part, there\'s nothing much to say. It can be pretty annoying to have the same basic plot for hundreds of anime/manga/etc. but even though it\'s something we keep on seeing, guess what ? It works anyway ; since it only is the basics, it doesn\'t mean the rest is bad.However, from how far it went (and by that I mean until the 9th episode, as I am writing after watching it), it still affects the story, that is with the small parts (that doesn\'t seem like much but can affect the story anyway) that are as clichéd. Be it the main hero throwing himself in death\'s jaws, or developing romantic feelings for the main heroine - and, well, some of you may wonder ""hey, they don\'t have feelings for each other, what are you talking about ?"" ; I actually don\'t know myself - and the producers probably don\'t as well ... -, but some parts really make you think that because of how stereotypical some situations can be - and lead to these kind of interpretations. So much that it can be painful to watch when you\'re used to these things, actually.However, if I make a comparison to the game, the story is the same - they did try to respect the original thing. Well, if we put aside the fact that Gran have better interaction than in the game - which is, of course, obvious ... - and that there are less stereotypical things - trust me, a certain fight in a certain port is less, let\'s say, ""risky"" in the game than in the anime. Which is nice, since it can be pretty difficult to make an anime out of a game, especially if said game can be personalized.Art - 7Granblue Fantasy as a game has one of the best artstyle I\'ve ever seen. It fits pretty well to the genre, and gives to the game its own identity. Be it the monsters or the characters in themselves, each one of them is detailed and simply stunning.Like I said for the story, they made efforts to be as close as possible to the game ; the same seems to go with the art. However, it is less detailed, and can, sometimes, seem untidy - which can be comprehensible, since not only are there the many problems about the anime industry, but also the basic quality of the original art may be too much to make an anime with.In a way, it lost one of its qualities, but kept it at the same time... Which can be weird.Sound - 8According to my good friend Google, Nobuo Uematsu - the same guy that did the music in Final Fantasy, yay ! - participated in the making of the music. Which is, in my opinion, nice. Really nice. I am not a great fan of him, but his work sure does give the right feeling, the right impression, that makes things much better. So, I won\'t say much on this part, except that the music is one of the best points of the game, and of the anime as well - though the opening/ending theme songs aren\'t particularily noticeable...Character - 5The characters ... Well, I did wrote in the Story part how stereotypical they can be, and, yes, Gran probably is the most typical protagonist, with Vyrn/Vee being the usual mascot as well. However, Gran being sort of basic, unoriginal, is the result of being the representation of the player - as such, he was, sort of, forced to be this way - not like the Admiral in Kantai Collection, which does not hold as much importance as Gran in their story. Wouldn\'t it be weird to give a well developed personality to a character you usually play depending on your own choices ? Making them the exact opposite of what they were created for - that is being identified with the player ?  Probably.Also, that may be me whining, but using Djeeta (the female counterpart of Gran) would\'ve been a better idea - there\'d be less clichés.Concerning the other characters, the problem is that they aren\'t much developed as well. They have their own identities, their own tastes, principles, values, however there\'s no place for them in the anime to develop them, which is saddening. We have plenty of opportunities to know them better in the game - with the Fate Episodes, which are sort of small skits you can unlock with the summoning of weapons and addition of the characters in your party. But since the anime is so short, and doesn\'t leave much for additional content aside from the game, we only know the character from their surface - as if it\'s only an introduction.Enjoyment - 7I have been saying a lot of bad things about the anime. Be it painful to watch, too stereotypical, not developed enough ... Yet, I think it is enjoyable. It can, sometimes, be predictable - way too predictable. And some moments can just be ... meh. But it\'s still enjoyable : if you don\'t think much about it, if you only watch it to pass time, or aren\'t acquaintanced enough with all the overused tropes, it can be enjoyable.Overall - 7Granblue Fantasy is a game. Before being an anime, it\'s a game, that reached over 14 millions players. The community around it is slowly growing, with the possibility to play it on computer - and in English. And the reason why an anime was made ? In my opinion, it would be to introduce the game to potential new players - or to please the people that are already playing it, by being able to see an anime out of it - see the characters they may love moving around ; having life given to them.The story, the art, the music : everything is made to fit to the beginning of the game. In other words, you watch it to be introduced to an entire universe, that you can discover by playing it. And they did a great job at that, at least on me : it\'s thanks to the fanarts and doujins that I discovered it and wanted to play it, but the anime confirmed my decision about it.In conclusion, I\'d recommend the anime for all the people who want to be introduced and know a bit about Granblue before trying the game, or for those who already play it.', ""This type of animes are my favorite, even that most of the time they screw up everything with a bad story, but I still really love watching Fantasy anime with characters that in addition to looking good, also have a good background story (Except for the main character).It's too soon to say that the story, in general, is bad, but we are following a character that his only goal is to see his father that left him to never come back without a good reason.I can not say that the art is bad, but it could be much better, sometimes it leaves you waiting....The sound is pretty good, I can not say that is the best, but it helps in a good way to set the story.The characters, each one has their own background story, a distinctive personality and if the creators take full advantage of them, can even become memorable. I can assure you that to be a promotional anime it's really good, it leaves a pleasant sensation, makes you want to play the game and go deeper into history.

I played it for a bit before I lost interest, but this anime is making me want to play it again.Despite not doing anything new and following the very cliched storyline of not-Final Fantasy (although it should be expected from the staff working on this), this series is charming on its own right.==StoryWe follow the story of Gran as he journeys through the seemingly infinite skies, adding crewmates along the way. Does this sound incredibly generic? Yes it does. This story is a very...classic tale that reminds people of 90\'s JRPGs. People who grew up with them would most likely enjoy this series.Despite being incredibly cliched in many ways, the story carries itself with character interaction and a very engaging and exciting endgoal: to explore the end of the skies. It seems like a really blank end, but it really does give you the feeling that you\'re enjoying the journey along with them.If you\'re a sucker for classic stories, Granblue Fantasy is sure to get you real excited.==ArtPeople might disagree with me, but I really do love the style that GBF used. Every character and background is so overwhelmingly charming and it really reflects the charm of the fantasy world.Animation wise, this is about normal A-1 Picture\'s quality, which in my opinion passes with flying colours. Some characters are really pretty and I could repeat a few scenes just to see some characters move. It really is that fascinating.Considering that they were also working on the infamous Eromanga this season (which also had excellent animation), A-1 really is flexing their big name all over the place.==SoundThe OST is pretty, especially if you\'ve played the original game. Not much to say about it though, but the opening and ending is the definition of ""you\'re entering a world of beautiful fantasy, filled with tons of different people."" I\'d love to buy the OP/EDs one day.==CharactersThe main feature of what makes the cast so great is that they aren\'t idiots. They know how to act and they trust each other without shouting commands, which unfortunately not alot of fantasy anime\'s do nowadays.Their interactions are less about a group of people coming together and working towards a goal, and more like a family who support each other towards their goals. It\'s a really touching dynamic and I wish can get to see more of it in other animes.There really isn\'t alot you can talk about regarding the characters, but they follow the classic JRPG party and villains.==EnjoymentThis is a classic JRPG story. Got tired of reading it over and over again? It\'s a really engaging story that is really easy to understand. It doesn\'t require alot of thinking, making it really easy to enjoy for casual watchers such as myself.==OverallWatch it, it\'s really good.

It basically had a lot of potential and all the factors to be a good anime, but ultimately fell short.This anime's for people who want to be introduced to Granblue before trying the game, or for those who already play it and want some eye candy.I don't know why but since episode one I just didn't like Lyria.  And I knew damn...well that plot armour wasn't gonna kill her since no one dies in this show. the animation was beautiful and so was Yuel.Yuel was best girl :P well that plot armour wasn't gonna kill her since no one dies in this show. the animation was beautiful and so was Yuel.Yuel was best girl :P"", 'only watched this because i needed noise in the background and i play the mobage, it has nothing special and it\'s your very cliché story with cliché charactersat least they look cute(i also watched this because i didn\'t follow the story in the game and i realize i didn\'t miss anything)what was nice about the music is i could recognize rearrangements of the game ostit\'s good to watch if you play the game, if you don\'t well there\'s nothing for you hereit\'s not awful tho, it\'s cool to see game characters animated... in an anime i meanthe art is... nothing specialYes ""nothing special"" is how...to define this anime. It\'s not awful, but don\'t come here for an amazing story with a amazing ost with deep characters.also stop comparing it to final fantasy you uncultured swines to define this anime. It\'s not awful, but don\'t come here for an amazing story with a amazing ost with deep characters.also stop comparing it to final fantasy you uncultured swines', ""Let the winds of adventure never stop blowing. Beyond the skies is a realm of endless possibilities, where new discoveries are awaiting, new friends to meet, and where we realize how big the world truly is. This was  the feeling I was experiencing when I was watching Granblue Fantasy The Animation.Granblue Fantasy is without a doubt what a great Final Fantasy anime would have been if SquareSoft (back in the day) or Square Enix (these days) ever made one that embodies the core elements of what makes Final Fantasy such a beloved and memorable franchise. The game this anime was based on had used...so much material from the Final Fantasy series that it is pretty much Final Fantasy and at the same time it is its own identity. When I first heard about this anime I thought it was gonna be a cool fantasy RPG anime that I could just watch in a relaxing fashion, then I saw a review with the words Final Fantasy in them. It was at that instant that I was gonna have this anime as my highest priority after I finish the one I was curently watching back then. Also it should be noted that Nobuo Uematsu is part of the staff and art director Hideo Minaba designed the game’s characters, they are also notable for their previous collaborations which are Final Fantasy V, Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy IX, and Lost Odyssey, no big names really.For the fans of Final Fantasy this anime will be a real treat, it has plenty of action, story, adventure, summons (yes summons), and most of all airships, AIRSHIPS!!! To be honest I’m a sucker for airships especially since Final Fantasy IX is my all-time favorite video game and that game had the most airships in any Final Fantasy. The way the anime incorporates these elements unto the story is amazing, I found that the summons are very distinct and even some that were never summons but your enemies can become your summons. The airships were amazing as well and were breathtaking to behold. Just like in Final Fantasy IX, they are everywhere and it just gives me that sense of adventure, where I can venture out into the open and just sail beyond the clouds. For fans of the Granblue Fantasy game, there’s no need to worry since the anime does justice to the game by faithfully following the Main Quests.The story starts out with Lyria running away from the Empire with the aid of the now ex-lieutenant Katalina. During the escape from the Empire’s airship, they run into Gran, a boy who longs to go on an adventure to meet his dad who is waiting for him at a mythical island that is considered a fairy tale by the people, and his bestfriend, a flying dragon, named Vyrn. And that was how their journey began and there was no better way to kick things off than with a Mega Flare of all things. Throughout their journey the encounter more allies and even get their own airship which I couldn’t help but be in awe each time it shows up since it looks like the combination of the Hilda Garde III and Invincible. There were also some surprises like someone literally doing a slam dunk to beat a boss. They also have to face bosses and the summons before acquiring them, just like the usual JRPG of old. They literally have them all except for random encounters which would have left me no choice but to give this adaptation a perfect score if they had done that.The story is great and with each new arc they go to a new island in the skies as well as get a new party member along the way or atleast meet some interesting people that could potentially become allies in the future. The journey is very much what one would expect if they ever wanted their life to be a JRPG, they go to a new town, be amaze when looking at the architecture, the people, the shops, shop for new gear and food. All that before you are faced with your new obstacle that ruins destroys your brief merriment.The anime really captures all that and it makes for a relaxing and balance formula that ultimately gives you a sense of immersion to a certain degree, well atleast that’s what I felt.  The characters were all interesting and the development felt just right. Each character got their chance to shine and contributed to the plot in both big and small ways. The side characters also showed promise and were interesting and only one antagonist proved bland. The only thing that would make this area perfect would be if Rackam had the voice of the sophisticated yet sexy Sky Pirate Balthier. It would be amazing to see how everything would fit if we ever get a second season since the potential party goes beyond a raid party or what the anime shows.Now let’s talk about the animation and art, due take note the animation does not equal art which many did not know of when watching anime, like KonoSuba for example. Animation wise it was a thrill to watch with enhancements, spells, the Primal Beast’s powers, explosions and the fluidity of the action. Now for the art, the aesthetics were great overall and the only thing that bugs me is that there are times where the characters outlines show in a sketchy style. Not sure if that’s intentional but it is the only problem I have with the art.The art was exceptional when it came to the Primal Beasts, they were distinct and made for some unique variations while staying true to their generally perceived image. Then we have the sound department, no complaints since the background music was fitting but I was too engrossed in the story to appreciate it fully. The only exception though would be when everyone fought the season’s final boss. The opening, Go by BUMP OF CHICKEN, was amazing and it really does kickoff the whole journey that I never got tired of it, so much so that I’m listening to the same song on repeat while writing this entire review. The ending song was also well done, it gave me the sense that the journey was not over and the promise of more adventures is just on the horizon.Everything wrapped up neatly in episode 12 and episode 13 was where the studio pulled off the biggest “what if” instance any anime adaptation could ever pull off as well as being the episode to distract yourself from knowing full well that it’s the last one. Despite the show ending, there is a lot more that is left unclear and there is so much more the story can offer. I can only pray that there would be a second or even third season with a 2-cour if we ever do get it.Granblue Fantasy the Animation gave me the sense of adventure that I find lacking in most video game to anime adaptations. It is one of the rare gems in that specific category. This was also the anime where I saw the most airships in any anime and as I’ve previously mention it’s my ultimate attention bait. For those who love to see an anime with a great adventure, awesome summons, and AIRSHIPS! I wholeheartedly recommend this anime. This was without a doubt enjoyable from start to finish and with so much left to explore in the story, it leaves you wanting for more. So give it a shot and have an adventure.P.S.

Nothing ground breaking there.  Art style for interior/city backgrounds I found to be well done in most cases;...most rural/outdoor areas where nothing special.  The story follows a very linear game like style (no surprise being based on a game).

It would make you think THAT is the visual definition of a fantasy world, and it makes you want to know more the lore of Granblue Fantasy The Animation\'s world setting.Only It\'s world is enough to make you hooked to get into the story and wanted to know more about what journey would the characters pursue.Now, let\'s get to the actual...review:Story: 2/10As you get past the introduction episode, you\'ll get a promise that the characters will go on through a long journey with a bumpy road ahead.On the first few episodes, you\'ll be thinking ""eh, this is a fine show"" while the characters get past their first few complications along their journey.\xa0 On the 2nd half of the show though, you\'ll start to feel the repetitions of their journey\'s complications.They go through the same exact paths over and over as their previous ones; find an island, explore said island, events happening, boss shows up, repeat.See my point it being repetitive? It get boring and boring as the episodes goes on.The pacing is not good. Sometimes it\'s slow, sometimes it\'s fast, and sometimes it even gets balanced for each episodes.Art & Animation: 7.5/10The artsyle is pretty, looks and feel distinctive, and pleases your eyes with the beautiful visuals of it\'s world. The character designs are detailed, smooth, and pretty as well.The animation is good. The movement of the characters, ships, and fights scenes looks smooth. Even the CG is pretty to look at.Sound: 7/10The sounds here is decent and nice to hear. The opening and ending songs were nice and the sfx is decent.The voice acting here is very hit or miss, but I could say it\'s decent overall (minus that annoying loli voice acting).Characters: 2/10For me personally, I mostly prefer character > story, and this is the part that Granblue Fantasy The Animation dissapoint me the most besides the repetitive story I already explains above.The way the characters got introduced lacks any backgrounds and information to even make the viewer cares about them.Almost all of them just pops out of nowhere, joins the group, gets a only a few minutes of backgrounds, and just gets away with it. How do I even care about them if I didn\'t even got a proper introductory of them?The villains is as bland as they could get. They just pops out of nowhere without any proper introduction and do ""bad"" things for the sake of being a villain with no proper explanations of their actions. Oh, I forgot to mention the talking animal Happy clone.Enjoyment: 4/10I did finish the show quick, but it felt like I\'m doing a chore while watching it with a thinking like ""Let\'s just get this over and get to another show"". It did entertaint me a few times with it\'s animation and it\'s visuals, there\'s also quite a few enjoyable scenes.Overall: 4.5 - (5: Average)I wouldn\'t recommend this to anyone who wanted to watch some good fantasy adventure with a nice characters and story, but I would recommend this to someone if they wanted to watch a mindless fun fantasy adventure show.

The art style is probably one of the anime\'s weak points!"". Well, I beg to disagree. While the art style definitely doesn\'t appeal to a certain number of viewers, I can say that the art style fits in very well. Take a look at the battle between Gran and Tiamat as an example. Coupled with a great soundtrack, the art style and animation gives you a certain feel; telling you that you\'re watching...a fantasy genre anime.Sure, there are times wherein the art style looks a little bit awkward. But you can definitely rely on the art style and animation when it comes to the action scenes.On the other hand, the details on the environment is something worth mentioning. Take a look at the details of Auguste Isles as an example. You can see that an effort was made when it comes to the backgrounds. Heck, you can even turn them into desktop backgrounds.Speaking of soundtracks, the OP and ED fits very well in the anime. With BUMP OF CHICKEN doing the opening, I don\'t have that much anything to say. The ED is probably one of my favorite soundtracks in this anime since it gives you a certain feeling; like someone who\'s about to go an a long journey. The soundtracks, especially when they fight a Primal Beast is something also worth mentioning. Definitely one of the strong points of this anime.The anime, especially its art style, is not something that will appeal to everyone. But that doesn\'t mean that it\'s a bad anime. It\'s an enjoyable watch; a breath of fresh air. The characters\' interactions are natural. The development between Gran and Lyria\'s relationship doesn\'t seem to be forced. Everyone\'s interactions are enjoyable.Every episode, at least up to the 12th episode, actually contributes to the main plot. Granblue Fantasy The Animation is doing a great job at advancing the plot and developing the characters. You won\'t find that much drama here. Just mostly adventure.If you\'ll ask me if I\'ll recommend it to other people, I\'ll definitely say yes.Speaking objectively, I\'ll give it something between 8 and 9. Though, personally, it\'s already a 9 for me since it transgress from your usual Fantasy genre anime. a fantasy genre anime.Sure, there are times wherein the art style looks a little bit awkward.

Because of this, I may not know the whole story or if there is anything before it.First we should talk about the characters. This is not that hard to talk about seeing that all the characters are pretty much stereotypes for video games. We have the wide eyed hero in Gran, the high ranking warrior in Katalina, the mysterious powerful damsel in distress in Lyria, and even our cute little mascot character in Vyrn. The other characters we meet kind of run in that sort of...suit as well. It’s not a bad way of starting out your stories but it also feels like it didn’t have much extra for it to stand out.The world and story feel like its out of a Final Fantasy game more then its own stand alone story. Many of the different races and creatures are seen in both of the series. (Even the logo for the original game looks like its straight for a final fantasy title.) I did find out that the game was notable for reuniting Nobuo Uematsu and Hideo Minaba who both worked on Final Fantasy titles in the late 90s and early 2000s though since they were Music and art directors, I did not think that the storyline would also be rather close to a Final Fantasy style as well.There was a point in the story that I was VERY confused about. In one of the battles (not going to say which or when it happens) right in the middle of the action we had characters seemingly coming out of the woodwork. We had never met them before, never were introduced, they just showed up. It wasn’t like any of these characters were boring too. These were characters that got me super interested in who they were but I just was never told what was going on. Because I have not touched the game, it made me wonder deeply on if these were characters we ‘could’ of made friends with? Would we be able to be friends with them later on in the anime or are they one shot characters that our dialog branch(if we were in a real game) will never come into contact with? I seriously want to know about at least a couple of them but sadly we really did not get a chance to know them.I had to put Episode 13 in as a extra little review within this one because it was just completely odd to me. Spoilers in this paragraph I guess though I don’t think it spoils much. With certain games out there, you can choose both a male version or a female version of the character. For most of the show, we follow Gran’s adventure with everyone. Episode 13 is called Extra for a reason and it’s because Djeeta, the girl version of Gran, is our main character instead. I’m not going to lie, this episode felt more like a ‘Omake’ or special video feature on what could happen if people had picked the female lead. I use the term lightly in this case because it also felt like they just changed the main character for fan service like when you have a episode set aside in a bathhouse or Onsen (hot spring). I did not care much for that sort of change and felt like it was out of place. And here we had another problem of characters coming out of the woodwork. While some of them were characters from the first time they did this, we again had no introduction so I feel it added to my feeling of confusion.The animation is pretty good, though it is easy to notice when they are using 3D renderings instead of 2D. It’s a little jarring when they do that although there are many other shows that do it far worse. I did like the how the 2D aspect had a bit of a sketchy sort of line art to it. A very nice change that gives the show its own style from other Fantasy based Anime around that time. As per my normal mindset though, I have to sigh ever so slightly at the fact that a big normal in Fantasy based games is that all the woman seem to be big breasted well fit women (or Lolita style in the case of one white mage and the race of little people) While the men are pretty boys or older muscular men. A little more diverse of a body type would be nice although it was not a hindrance to the story or the actual art, its more just aesthetics for me.The script definitely sounds like it’s definitely from a video game, especially in the beginning of the show. I did watch this in the English Dub (Shocker, I know) and I have to say that some of the voice actors did bother me slightly. Vyrn (voiced by Sandy Fox) just felt like a scratchy and like it was trying to hit a much lower pitch then what Sandy could do. Lyria (voiced by Kira Buckland) sounded a little air headed and dreamy like she wasn’t fully there. Not sure if she was like that in the games but it feels a bit off. I am not blaming any of these voice actors as they have done a really amazing job in most of the things that they have been in. The music is amazing, Nobuo Uematsu is a very well respected musical director and his work really shows.Overall, I did fall in love with the story as well as the characters very similar to when I play games like this. Sure main part of the story is sort of told over and over again in different forms, but the overall aspect of the journey was pretty good. The only problem I see is when they start adding things that I don’t think anyone would of known outside of the game. Certain people showing up out of the blue with no introduction, Episode 13 and its strange change, and the different races they seem to gloss over like we should already know what they were. There is a season 2 out there that I am going to try and find as well as a OVA (or ONA, I have seen it listed both ways) that I hope I can see but I am a little worried seeing as a new Studio and Director as well as writer did them, but I have my hopes. Take a glance at it if your interested in Fantasy and RPGs but I would consider episode 13 to be one you can miss out on if you really want to (for now). suit as well.

I do hope they do a second season and tie everything all up at the finish."", ""Huh. I originally wasn't going to review this, as the second season is airing right now, and I wanted that to be done before I reviewed the series, but I found I had too much to say about the first season to keep my mouth shut about it. So why not? Might as well talk about it. Granblue Fantasy started out as a smartphone JRPG that became really popular, and is still going to this day. It received an anime adaptation, and the second season is currently airing. This anime never even crossed my radar, but I was bored and wanted something new to watch,...and when I found out this had an English dub, I decided to watch it. I finally finished the first season now that it's up on Netflix, and I definitely like it, though it's not without its problems.In a world where the skies are endless and traveling between floating islands is the norm, a young country boy, Gran, dreams of finding his father and traveling the world. But while out on an excursion with his dragon friend Vyrn, he runs into a young woman, Lyria, and her knight companion, Katalina, who are being hunted by the evil Erste empire. They want to use Lyria's powers for nefarious purposes, and Katalina betrayed the empire by escaping with Lyria. When he is mortally wounded in a battle, Lyria gives him some of her life force to save him, and summons a powerful beast, Bahamut, to drive the forces away. Thus, Gran's life force is bonded with Lyria's, so wherever she goes, he has to follow, or else they both die. Gran doesn't mind, as he wants to journey to the mythical island of Estalucia, called the Island of the Astrals, as that's where his father is. The three of them decide to do just that, and on their journey, they make new friends, encounter new enemies, and discover the secrets of their world and what the Empire plans to do with it, and by extension, Lyria.Basically, this anime is very old school despite being relatively new. It pretty much adheres to all the standard JRPG tropes from the 90s to now: An optimistic man from a backwater village who goes on an adventure, a mysterious damsel in distress with strange powers, a cute perky animal companion, an evil empire seeking to destroy the world and find out its secrets, a ragtag crew with a variety of eclectic personalities, and so on. If you're familiar with the original cellphone game, this isn't much of a surprise, as many of the staff that worked on it also worked on various Final Fantasy games back in the day. The anime pretty much feels like an RPG, with a colorful world filled with people from all walks of life, even half-animal people, and the animation is no slouch in that it creates these beautiful, vivid settings that are a feast for the eyes, from Gran's pastoral village to the steampunk town of Valtz. It helps that the action and fight scenes are all very well choreographed, with fighting moves actually being animated.Honestly, my only complaints with the animation are twofold, and they are pretty big flaws. One is that the CGI monsters really don't blend well with the 2D animation and could have been integrated into the scenery better. The second one is with the outlines around the characters. I don't know if this was a deliberate art style choice, or the animators didn't have time to polish the character designs before the episodes were set to air, but seriously, all of the linework around the characters looks really sloppy, unrefined, and unfinished. Unlike the smooth linework in say, shows like AnoHana or anything by KyoAni, the linework in Granblue Fantasy makes it seem like the animators never got around to adding extra layers of ink and smoothing out the outlines around the characters, and half the time it looks like several pieces are missing. I don't know of any better way to describe it. Thankfully, from what little I've seen of season two, this has been rectified, namely because a different studio, MAPPA, is working on season 2 instead of A-1 Pictures. It's not too noticeable to the untrained eye, but once you see it, you can't unsee it. I don't have much to say about the soundtrack, as it's just awesome. I might be biased here, since it was done by famous video game composer Nobuo Uematsu and by relative newcomer Yasunori Nishiki, who you may know as the guy who made Octopath Traveler's OST, and is just as awesome. I don't think I can say much about the OST that others haven't said already.While I personally liked the characters in Granblue, it can't be denied that they all fulfill various JRPG tropes and aren't the most three-dimensional. Gran is the typical happy-go-lucky protag who wants to help others and explore the world, Vyrn is the cute comic relief animal mascot, Rackam is the wise adult, Io is the cute little tsundere girl, so on and so forth. They're not bad, but to anyone who's tired of these particular archetypes, they can seem bland and uninspired. In all honesty, Lyria's kinda useless. I mean, she's not bad or terribly written, and her position in the story makes sense, but most of the time she hangs around Gran or Katalina or gets kidnapped. Not all the time, but since she doesn't really fight or do anything to defend herself, she's not exactly breaking out of the damsel in distress mold anytime soon. But I have seen characters who are worse and much more annoying about it, so I'm gonna cut Lyria some slack on this one. Plus, I thought Io's shtick of poking fun at Rackam's age was stupid, and any humor that was supposed to come out of it just seemed forced. Furthermore, many of the oneshot villains were bland and one-note, not doing much except doing bad things and being evil for the sake of it. But for all I know, the second season might give them more screentime and development.Even the main story itself doesn't really seem all that special. It's just a ragtag crew exploring the world, collecting spirits, and trying to fight the evil empire. Those kinds of stories are pretty much a dime a dozen, but considering how many bad isekai anime that have been coming out in the past few years, particularly ones involving generic video game worlds with shoehorned in game mechanics and no effort into actually trying to have some substance, a pure, straight fantasy anime is pretty refreshing after so many kid-gets-whisked-to-another-world stories. It's not trying to be some epic masterpiece or have some kind of deep, philosophical message. It just wants to be an earnest, pure, fun fantasy adventure, and while certain elements could have been done better, and the dialogue less overly explainy, it's still a fun ride.If you do decide to watch the first season, here's a little caveat: The anime is said to have 13 episodes, but only twelve of them cover the main story, with the thirteenth episode, titled Another Sky, basically being an alternate universe centering around a female main character, Djeeta, who is the female player character in the game and completely replaces Gran. It has no bearing on the main story whatsoever, and it recaps the story with quite a few changes, but it is recommended you watch the main show to get a jist of who the side characters are. There's also an OVA in that same universe that tells a Halloween-themed side story, but I haven't found it yet so I have nothing I can say on that. Furthermore, I've only seen this in English so far, not Japanese, but the English dub is very solid, with great casting and even bringing in some voice actors who haven't done much work lately back into the spotlight (such as Tara Jayne as the evil Furias). I only have one complaint about the dub: During Lyria's sad moments, Kira Buckland makes her voice come off as way too shrill and whiny. She's normally pretty good with this, but since she's using a higher pitched voice than usual, she unfortunately missed the mark on that one. But that's really about it.Bottom line, if you want a straight fantasy story that's just plain fun, Granblue Fantasy is certainly a high flying adventure. I'll review the second season separately. and when I found out this had an English dub, I decided to watch it. I finally finished the first season now that it's up on Netflix, and I definitely like it, though it's not without its problems.In a world where the skies are endless and traveling between floating islands is the norm, a young country boy, Gran, dreams of finding his father and traveling the world.

I don't think I can say much about the OST that others haven't said already.While I personally liked the characters in Granblue, it can't be denied that they all fulfill various JRPG tropes and aren't the most three-dimensional. Gran is the typical happy-go-lucky protag who wants to help others and explore the world, Vyrn is the cute comic relief animal mascot, Rackam is the wise adult, Io is the cute little tsundere girl, so on and so forth. They're not bad, but to anyone who's tired of these particular archetypes, they can seem bland and uninspired. In all honesty, Lyria's kinda useless. I mean, she's not bad or terribly written, and her position in the story makes sense, but most of the time she hangs around Gran or Katalina or gets kidnapped. Not all the time, but since she doesn't really fight or do anything to defend herself, she's not exactly breaking out of the damsel in distress mold anytime soon. But I have seen characters who are worse and much more annoying about it, so I'm gonna cut Lyria some slack on this one. Plus, I thought Io's shtick of poking fun at Rackam's age was stupid, and any humor that was supposed to come out of it just seemed forced. Furthermore, many of the oneshot villains were bland and one-note, not doing much except doing bad things and being evil for the sake of it. But for all I know, the second season might give them more screentime and development.Even the main story itself doesn't really seem all that special. It's just a ragtag crew exploring the world, collecting spirits, and trying to fight the evil empire. Those kinds of stories are pretty much a dime a dozen, but considering how many bad isekai anime that have been coming out in the past few years, particularly ones involving generic video game worlds with shoehorned in game mechanics and no effort into actually trying to have some substance, a pure, straight fantasy anime is pretty refreshing after so many kid-gets-whisked-to-another-world stories. It's not trying to be some epic masterpiece or have some kind of deep, philosophical message. It just wants to be an earnest, pure, fun fantasy adventure, and while certain elements could have been done better, and the dialogue less overly explainy, it's still a fun ride.If you do decide to watch the first season, here's a little caveat: The anime is said to have 13 episodes, but only twelve of them cover the main story, with the thirteenth episode, titled Another Sky, basically being an alternate universe centering around a female main character, Djeeta, who is the female player character in the game and completely replaces Gran. It has no bearing on the main story whatsoever, and it recaps the story with quite a few changes, but it is recommended you watch the main show to get a jist of who the side characters are. There's also an OVA in that same universe that tells a Halloween-themed side story, but I haven't found it yet so I have nothing I can say on that. Furthermore, I've only seen this in English so far, not Japanese, but the English dub is very solid, with great casting and even bringing in some voice actors who haven't done much work lately back into the spotlight (such as Tara Jayne as the evil Furias). I only have one complaint about the dub: During Lyria's sad moments, Kira Buckland makes her voice come off as way too shrill and whiny. She's normally pretty good with this, but since she's using a higher pitched voice than usual, she unfortunately missed the mark on that one. But that's really about it.Bottom line, if you want a straight fantasy story that's just plain fun, Granblue Fantasy is certainly a high flying adventure. I'll review the second season separately."", 'Granblue Fantasy is another fantasy anime with adventure elements, nothing special.It feels extremely repetitive with all the members slowly joining the team one by one, with some event happening before that and those primal beasts getting healed by the two main characters so easily. Because of this, it gets pretty predictable and there\'s also the fact how there were no plot twists and the story was kind of boring. There are some moments that leave you thinking, ""what..."".The slow pacing only picking up towards the end was a good thing in my eyes, and minimal fanservice until the last episode, which is when it\'s nothing...but fanservice and no plot, because Gran has been switched for this girl named Djeeta for those who\'ve played the game, and everyone (including a whole bunch of characters introduced in the penultimate episode) is at the beach.The music is excellent with very nice theme songs by BUMP OF CHICKEN and HARUHI. Voices are also not bad. Art and animation are decent and somewhat unique, and is very colourful but never too bright.Character development is not really seen, and characters do not seem to have deep personalities, and this may be because they are from a game. At times I was annoyed by Lyria\'s personality, being all cheerful, and then that one episode where she was hating on herself and being quite stubborn. Overall they just have bland personalities. However, the character relationships were well-developed and good.There is some element of mystery that leaves a cliffhanger regarding the Black Knight, Rosetta and Gran\'s father, which will probably be explored if a second season comes. This is probably the only aspect that makes the watcher think and wonder. However, this was not explored upon much, unfortunately.It is somewhat enjoyable at most and is not very hard to watch. It should only be watched if you are bored, have played the game, or like fantasy anime.Overall, I don\'t recommend it. but fanservice and no plot, because Gran has been switched for this girl named Djeeta for those who\'ve played the game, and everyone (including a whole bunch of characters introduced in the penultimate episode) is at the beach.The music is excellent with very nice theme songs by BUMP OF CHICKEN and HARUHI.

Which I think is important... a show needs to stand on its own.  How does Granblue Fantasy hold up?Honestly?  This is probably the most generic Fantasy story I've seen.  I really struggle to find even one unique thing about this show.  Its story is old and tired, its visual style is inoffensive and forgettable, its action is utterly standard, its characters are bland, its setting... little better but it's still been...done.Let's start with the story: a mysterious waif appears in front of a callow youth from a rural out-of-the-way place and together with a stern but kind mentor, they need to undertake a long journey and resist an evil empire.  That's our story here!  It's also the story of hundreds of other novels, serials, TV shows, films, and video games over the course of the last century or two, but most of those cases had some variation.  Granblue Fantasy feels like it doesn't just not innovate, it actively wanted to avoid innovating.  Maybe there's something to that: a game wants to have a broad appeal after all.  The problem is that even a game (and especially a show) needs to have appeal to have broad appeal.  And Granblue Fantasy is so generic that it risks failing that mark.  It's almost like the platonic ideal of a Fantasy story.  By that token I can't really hate it.  I mean, it doesn't do anything wrong, but it doesn't do anything wrong because it doesn't try anything.  The setting, as I mentioned before, is a slight bit more creative, a world of islands in an endless sky?  OK, point for visual wonder but it ends up being basically the same as an Age of Sail setup (at least as far as Granblue uses it) and just reminds me of better takes on the idea (particularly the game Skies of Arcadia).  There's nothing here that's really out there or creative, so it still doesn't really establish much of an identity.The characters, as you might expect, are basically walking archetypes.  To Granblue Fantasy's little credit they do have a note or two that weren't strictly required by their roles.  The voice acting helps a lot, they're all pretty well done... but they are still pretty clearly ticking basic boxes.  Gran is the nice young swordsman, Lyria is the hopelessly kind mysterious waif, Katalina... OK I'll kind of give Granblue that her first role usually isn't filled by a lady (it's more an old man kind of job) and she kind of fills two (being an imperial defector as well) but she still doesn't innovate a lot.  Vyrn is the useless cute mascot who never says or does anything of value, though, and Rackam is the gruff guy who pretends to not want to help but really has a heart of gold in his arc.  Let's face it, you've seen all these characters before.  I may not have played Granblue Fantasy, but I took to calling these folks by the names of any other character of their type (particularly their more colorful and interesting counterparts in the video game Skies of Arcadia, which shares a lot of setting details) because the characters her do so little to stand out from the pack.The art is... well, it's pretty enough, I guess.  It doesn't really go off-model or do anything wrong, per say... but it also doesn't do a lot right.  The designs of most of the main characters are clean but also extremely basic (less so the extras and latecomers, who are a bit colorful) and the action is OK but also not exactly good.  By in large it's slow and basic – you can see everything that's happening, but there's not a lot of wonder to it, and fight scenes will screech to a halt to let characters talk.  Once or twice you'll see a cool stunt but most of the time it's all just the sort of stuff that would be background filler in a show with better choreography.  All the same, I've seen a lot worse; compared to something like Fate/Stay Night or Shakugan no Shana the action here would be absolutely embarrassing, but on its own I guess it passed muster.On sound, I've already touched on the fact that the voice acting is actually surprisingly good.  True, these characters are tropes, but the actors all sell them pretty well.  I wasn't pulled out of the moment listening to Gran, Lyria, or Katalina thinking “Someone in a recording studio was sure paid to say that”, they spoke their overused paint-by-numbers dialogue with conviction.  The rest of the sound is a total nothing.  Again, there are no huge glaring faults like bad mixing or excessive sfx, it does fit the moment, but there wasn't any care given to the sound design.  The music, even the opening and ending, are like nothing you would ever remember in your life.  I'd say that's fitting for a video game adaptation, since video games often have fairly simple background tracks that only exist to fill dead air so you're not listening to an uncomfortable void of silence, but really most of the video games I can think of at least have a few memorable tracks, whether title music or boss themes or what have you, into which at least a little effort was put.  And the good ones can use music to great effect, setting the mood for different areas in a powerful and memorable way.  Granblue Fantasy (the Animation, no idea about the game as I've said before) does none of that, it's all totally forgettable.  I can kind of remember a little of what the opening sounds like (and it didn't get me pumped, excited, or interested like so many good openings do), but nothing else.  I know there was music but... yeah.  It's that bland.And that's the takeaway from the show as a whole.  It's bland, it's forgettable, it's inoffensive.  Nothing about it is memorable.  Nothing about it takes any risks.  Nothing about it has any sort of identity.  It's all so dull that for episode 13 we're treated to an AU of the story where Gran is replaced by a girl named Djeeta and there are probably as many original ideas in the recap section of the comedy beach episode as we got in the 12 episodes of actual plot.But... that's not a crime, really.Granblue Fantasy the Animation can probably be summed up as “Mostly Harmless”.  There's nothing bad or insulting about it at any point, it just does its thing exactly to formula and lets you go about your business.  I have seen shows that have tried less and failed spectacularly for it.  True, I'll probably remember those shows longer, but when all those memories are negative, I think I'd prefer Granblue.  I won't recommend it, really, but I won't advise against it, and I could see the show having value as 'comfort food' for the fantasy fan.  It does nothing daring or creative, but sometimes you might just want to wash the taste of anything else out of your mouth, and Granblue Fantasy will probably do that, acting as a creative palate cleanser.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 5Art: 6Sound: 7Character: 6Enjoyment: 6Total: 6VERDICT:  Mostly Harmless.

As fake as this sounds, I found myself reading the youtube terms and conditions instead of paying full attention when I wasn't halfway through episode one. That was ridiculous enough to make me finally make an account just to put that out there.That's not to say I think it is bad necessarily there are a few things the episode did that I really did like, I gave this a 4 after all. The main thing I like is Gran(the main character)'s character design....The way his character is designed shows that someone at least had an understanding of armor and the willingness to bring the elements of realism into the fantasy setting. The other armor isn't too bad either, and even if no one else's are the swords of the main characters who use them (at least in this episode) look good while maintaining a balance of the fantasy aspect without breaking believability. That is something that meany things fail at, so at least I feel praise is due to this point.Beyond that, though there wasn't anything that caught me, even the 2 heroines introduced, both of which are usually types I like, didn't catch me at all. The reasons for this I believe lie in three points so I will lay those out bellow.Reason one is the screen direction. Quite simply it is bland, nothing cinematically interesting or impressive happens not even standard. In short, there is a clear lack of effort in the transitions between scenes and it shows. The most visually interesting thing was the crystal breaking free in the opening sequence, but hey I'm a sucker for purple swirly smoke effects and shiny things especially animated crystal, and that wasn't interesting it's self but because I like the color. I'll be honest if more effort had been put into just that opening sequence I might consider watching episode two just for that.The second is the exposition. There wasn't actually a lot of it I hardly know anything at all about the world, yet I feel like the episode was dedicated to catching me up to speed on what is going on without giving me any reason to care about it. This style, while it still wouldn't be good, would find its place in a season two premier episode. Here, however, it seems to assume that I the viewer should already care about the characters and story before knowing anything, which quite frankly is insulting to my intelligence as a viewer and isolates anyone who doesn't know the source material. I have to give something of a pass to this however given how well Gran himself was introduced initially. Up until he encountered Lyria the introduction was paced well, and I was honestly beginning to become interested in the character and his hometown. After that point, the pacing shifted to fit everything they wanted into the rest of the episode to get to the hook for the next episode, which had we kept things going a bit longer building Gran's backstory now rather than most likely doing so later through flashbacks or ignoring that the town existed at all as if expecting the viewer to forget the protagonist had a past, it would have been entirely possible to end the episode with Alize arriving when she did leaving a slight mystery hook rather than a half-assed generic power fantasy hook. Personally, I would have cared a lot more to find out how she would perceive the situation than such an instant power-up reset button. That ending itself felt contrived to bind the characters into traveling together, which they had already agreed on and come to terms with. This ruined the good thing it had going for it, the sense that Gran has strong ideals of honor to see through what he had started even if he had to leave everything behind without fully understanding what that thing was. Having this stand as the reason he travels was a point of respect for the character even if may itself be a contrivance, it was a properly executed contrivance up until that point.This brings me to the final of the three grievances, the mascot character. As someone who enjoys pre-cure, what I'm going to say about this will seem out of place at first. I don't like mascot characters and especially ones who can fly. I know that sounds petty, and it is, but I don't say that without reason. I see there being a right way and a wrong way to approach mascot characters. This is the latter. First I'd like to be positive this time and mention what I consider to be the right way to approach a mascot character, for which I am going to use strangely enough Nurse Witch Komugi-chan R, as well as My little Pony as contrasting positive examples.First the mascot type character in the small horse show. Spike is a baby dragon character who exists essentially for the two main functions of a mascot character, being a foil there to tell Twilight Sparkle that she is a stupid horse and her ideas suck only to be blown off, so we the viewer can see that the character they serve isn't seen as a Mary Sue by the other characters in story and enforce believability by giving a sense of genuine dialogue, and straight man comic relief AKA classmate-kun in a slice of life.Whereas Spike was the straight man first and Comic Relief second, the mascot characters in Nurse Witch are Comic relief characters who think they are the first type in character while allowing the writer's knowledge to remain separate. If you know anything about Nurse Witch, yes all of the mascot characters can fly. These are treated as a kind of Navi-like character to tell the viewer and character things that neither cares all too much about but is either necessary and expository without becoming overbearing, or mildly interesting, while much of the time being ignored by both in a way that can be enjoyable and let the viewer slowly come to like them even if they have a difficult personality.The type that Vyrn here and Happy from Fairy Tail are, however, assumes that the viewer expects them to be there and is already ok with that they are purely comic relief characters who happen to know the main bad ass for at least the first half of the given narrative if not its entirety.The flying bit is more from an experience of a tendency to dislike these characters than a specific reason. Regardless I'll put it this way the character the main character(s) is bouncing ideas off of or looking to for support should be in a metaphoric sense grounded, the physical is a good way to show this. In My little Pony Spike is a dragon a creature known for flight yet can't fly; in Nurse Witch the mascots who are based on animals which have no business flying but can, in a way showing their detachedness from reality that they frequently display in speech. Another example of a conceptually good mascot character would be Kyubey in Madoka Magica who while malevolent and detached from reality as we see it, is well grounded and logical from another point of view. Likely thinking of Kyubey, for those who have seen Madoka, will bring to mind the image of it sitting in Madoka windowsill waiting for her contract. The point being these characters have their own existence beyond just being the annoying floaty thing that is there because the tropes said so.This again isn't to say this anime is terrible just that I found it to underwhelming to enjoy it. If you do that's cool, whether or not you can enjoy it is the important thing.

I have not read the manga.If ever an anime was a ""kid\'s show,"" it\'s this one. That\'s not necessarily a bad thing, but it is sterile. It\'s a great show for kids. It\'s not bad for adult either, just, as I said, extremely sterile. And a bit saccharine.What I liked:1. It was an engaging and sweet story.2. It was just romantic enough without being a Romance....3. I liked that they didn\'t spend a lot of time on the ship but on the islands.4. It had all the traditional Fantasy elements in a sort of new setting.5. It was episodic, with each episode wrapping up and leading into the next one without a cliffhanger.6. It had a touch of darkness in each episode but it rarely darkened the characters, which could be a good thing or bad thing, depending on your tastes.What I didn\'t like:1. It was sterile. I can\'t really go into more detail without giving spoilers.2. There was one too-convenient plot devise that really didn\'t make sense. Again, can\'t go into detail without giving a spoiler.STORY: The story\'s not unique in the slightest. It\'s an adventure story. One character is running toward something, two are running from something, one\'s wandering for the sake of wandering, and one\'s along for the ride. Pretty typical adventure group. That\'s not a bad thing, especially for a Fantasy story. It\'s predictable after a point, but that\'s not bad either.ART: The art was pretty good. The panorama of the GrandCypher was gorgeous though the interior was pretty bland. The characters were distinct from one another with a good amount of detail. Many of the cityscapes were stunning.SOUND: There were a couple times the music was too Fantasy or rather, too Children\'s Fantasy for my taste but it wasn\'t terrible. I did like the opening and ending themes. The sound effects were good.CHARACTERS: These aren\'t real deep characters. They\'re archetypes more than characters but they fill their roles well and for the most part, are likable.OVERALL: I enjoyed it. I\'d recommend it if you can stomach the saccharine sterility. Definitely one of the few I\'ve watched that I\'d actually recommend for kids. 3. I liked that they didn\'t spend a lot of time on the ship but on the islands.4.

The series excluding episode 13 is done as the male character to whom saves a girl and then becomes connected to her forever and thus starts their journey. It is set out like a classic game where there is a boss at each island they visit that needs to be defeated to move on.ArtThe art is a nice, albeit unusual since it relies on the look of as if a book has come to life style with lines around the characters. It actually fits...the series quite nicely. Gives a fairy tale vibe.SoundOP is a very good song and the ED is OK. The sounds during the series are pretty standard for this and the music for dramatic effect again is pretty standard.CharacterThe development is good for the main characters but as you will see suddenly a huge amount of heroic people appear with no real clue to who they are.Episode 13 takes a weird turn since they do a fan service episode that has the female main character that you can use in the game. The reason this is a bit weird is suddenly unlike the character you have got to know so far (male one) she is super confident and everyone around her is suddenly overpowered. The enemy is suddenly a joke of weakness but it is a fan service episode.Enjoyment1-12 were enjoyable and 13 was enjoyable just a bit confusing to follow with the sudden overpowered female characters to which you will see the men also shown a bit lazy and careless also during it. Nothing wrong with that just it is odd since that is not how it has been portrayed up until that point.OverallThe series is good in the end and I choose now to watch it in time for the season 2 that is in fall 2019. It is worth a watch and is easy to get on with.I do wonder what it is like in the airship part of the Grancrest though with that airship bridge that looks far more useful than the ships ones. the series quite nicely.

Despite these issues, for a mobile game adaption, it is surprisingly good.The story of Granblue Fantasy follows Gran, a kid who is searching for his father who went on a journey and never returned. His story gets set in motion when he finds Lyria and Katalina, defects from the Empire on the run. The story starts extremely fast. Within one...episode, Lyria and Katalina escape, Gran throws away his life to travel with them, he dies, is reincarnated, and becomes the lifelong soulmate of Lyria. The hyper pace continues throughout the season. The story is nothing special, it's pretty generic and nothing especially new. 5/10.I actually found the art and animation to be a strongsuit of this anime. I was expecting a lot of stills and poor animation, but it was surprisingly fluid. Battle scenes aren't too amazing, but have motion and are interesting enough to make me maintain my attention. The art style is colorful yet muted, an interesting mixture that led scenes to almost like more like paintings than moving pieces sometimes. 8/10!The sound was another strong suit of the anime. The OP and ED were both great, and the background music worked well too. Sound effects were impressive as well, such as gunshots sounding especially bulky and realistic, rather than random stock gunshot sounds from online, which I've heard in shows before. 7/10.The characters were a weak point. The main characters just didn't have much background or unique character, and I didn't find myself caring about them. The most glaring character issue is the villains. Holy God, these villains sucked. They were boring, incompetent, annoying, and just flat out stupid. The two main villains are a dude who sounds like he inhaled helium and has a mustache that just screams to be rubbed like a ancient cartoon villain, and a midget who briefly appears and is defeated by having a leg of his chair shot, resulting in his fat little body rolling down a hill and being unable to be stopped. These dudes are some of the stupidest, most worthless villains I've ever seen. On top of that, their knights are even more worthless, they make stormtroopers look like the most brilliant, effective soldiers you've ever seen. 4/10.Despite the lackluster story and mediocre villains, the show is entertaining enough. Seeing the journey of Gran's crew is surprisingly fun, and the art style is pretty and well animated. The conclusion of the show was also rather disappointing, as around 500 characters randomly appear to beat the enemy and then disappear forevermore after being on screen for a brief 1-2 minutes. I assume these are characters from the mobile game, but it felt like a super cheap way to just throw them into the show suddenly. Another thing to note is the final episode which is horribly misnamed as episode 13, when it should be an OVA it is completely detached from the main story and features the female version of Gran, once again I assume from the game. 6/10.Overall, Granblue Fantasy is a generic fantasy tale with surprisingly impressive art, yet is dragged down by poor pacing, inadequate villains, and an uninteresting story. If you are a fantasy fan, you will probably enjoy this enough to watch it through and have a fun time, but you probably won't remember it much or care a week later. 6/10. episode, Lyria and Katalina escape, Gran throws away his life to travel with them, he dies, is reincarnated, and becomes the lifelong soulmate of Lyria.

Every situation, dialog line, plot point, dramatic pause, really everything made me cringe so much that it was spectacular in its own right - at least up until the middle of the show. I don't think it changed after the middle, more likely I just got used to it. It somehow stopped feeling annoying or making me cringe, instead it just felt stupid or even funny. You could almost imagine humor through self-parody was their goal.In the end it's an anime made for...the game fans, not for the general audience. I can imagine game fans liking it much more, forgiving much more of its flaws and even orgasming in ecstasy on the last episode when it literally starts raining random game characters.

Actually, I take that back because Io and Rackam do get some fleshing out somewhat, yet their fleshing out still takes a backseat for the original four.The places remained lacking, for they end up simply a place for gaining another power up via Lyria and Gran saving the day. Almost every primal faced the same lack of development the two heroes, Katrina and Vyrn got. They’re simply archetypes we’ve seen before and nothing more. Part of this lies with one of the problems with game adaptions in that some don’t flesh out the characters more than they are in the game.

My main issue with episode 12 is that it appears to be used as an excuse to shoehorn what I assume is the rest of the cast of characters from the game into the anime. The characters weren't being fleshed out much to begin with so throwing in like 30 random characters into the final battle certainly didn't help. Then there is episode 13. It truly is an extra 1. For no reason, in episode 13 Gran is replaced with Djeeta (assumedly the female counterpart to Gran in the game), and the final episode is an unnecessary beach episode.

Ishura,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54449/Ishura,"['This is just my temporary opinion after watching the first 3 episodes. When I first read the synopsis of this anime, I thought it would be similar to ""Record of Ragnarok."" However, after watching 3 episodes, there hasn\'t been a clear discussion about the tournament. The three episodes only delve into the background of each character. If it continues like this, there might be only one fight in the tournament, as it would take many episodes to explain the background of each participant. In my opinion, this is less efficient.The animation and visuals are nothing special, quite ordinary. The CGI is a bit uncomfortable to...watch.The anime lacks a compelling soundtrack, with too many moments featuring only dialogue.

One thing sets Ishura apart from other anime fights is the dialogue and strategic depth during fights, avoiding clichéd exchanges for interactions that hint at complex relationships and personal stakes, making the action in Ishura both thrilling and meaningful.What might bother someAshura’s deliberate pacing and some lower budget CGI scenes (where it is not that necessary in my opinion), which can sometimes detract from the immersive experience.Is it for you?If you love dark fantasy that\'s not just about battles but also makes you think and feel, you should definitely check out Ishura. It\'s a show that rewards you for paying attention and thinking about what\'s happening. Even if you don\'t like dark fantasy I believe depth and mature story telling will make a difference.However, if you\'re looking for non-stop action from the start, Ishura might test your patience. It\'s more about slowly getting you into its world and the minds of its characters. But for those who enjoy a story that mixes action with deeper, thoughtful storytelling, Ishura is a journey worth taking.Final Thoughts:Ishura is a great example of how awesome fantasy can be when it focuses on building a detailed world, developing interesting characters, and exploring deep themes. Whether you\'re drawn to its complex themes or just want to dive into a well-built fantasy world, Ishura offers a unique and engaging experience.Rating:STORY: 10CHARACTERS: 10ART: 10SOUND: 9ANIMATIONS: 9OVERALL: 9', 'Ishura is probably the most unique action anime I’ve ever seen. A slow but rewarding burn that has one of the coolest premises you’ll find and an immense amount of worldbuilding. This was one of the best shows of Winter 2024 and it’s a shame it flew under the radar.While not an expert in the field of battle royale anime, I’ve seen a few and Ishura stands head and shoulders above the rest. What makes it so good to me is the wide range of characters with unique abilities who are all very OP and have unique fighting styles. Additionally, there’s the perfect amount of...characterisation for each member of the cast. By the time they’re all introduced it really feels like we’ve established a connection with them. Every character is set up with their own episode that shows us their motivations, their abilities, their backstories and just what makes them tick. While at times it may seem a little tedious because you just want to get to the big battle royale, it was definitely a great decision because it made the fights at the end of the series that much more meaningful.  The other big thing for me is that every character is strong. I mean the diversity of abilities in this series was shocking. The victor in a fight is just determined by how they match up with a particular opponent which made things fun.Ishura has no main character, at least not yet, so the story kind of goes from one viewpoint to another depending on the episode. I liked this because it developed a rather large cast in a short period of time. While a couple characters felt underbaked, most of the cast I felt a nice attachment to and liked. Also made it difficult to choose who to root for because of the various goals of the characters. In a way, this 12 episode season felt like the longest character selection screen.The worldbuilding is also really good in this. The magic system is nuanced, the political situation is interesting and there’s a ton of fantastical elements in this that just work really well. You can tell the author put a ton of time into fleshing out the world, characters and making you feel apart of a living breathing universe. It’s a bit frustrating at times though, because while you can tell the world is vast and detailed, sometimes I felt it wasn’t being utilised to its full potential. I’m sure that’s intentional as this is just adapting the first book I believe and there’s a ton more story to go. It just can be a bit slow at times. Nevertheless it has all the makings of a cool fantasy world.The only downside I really have is that the story really just got going at the end. Like we spent so long building these characters up for a big battle and then the battle happens in a couple episodes and that’s it(not the end of the story, just the season). I wanted more! This world is so unique and the anime was a blast to watch. This is more a testament to how much I liked the show rather than a serious complaint though. I do understand it takes time to develop characters and appreciate the author’s intent.Animation and fight scenes are really good. There’s some cgi, but it’s not distracting and the direction during the big set pieces is more than good enough.Ishura is a must watch if you’re a fan of action anime, battle royales or if you just want something different to watch. I watch everything every season and I really can’t think of a show that’s been quite like this one. I had a blast watching it every Wednesday and I’m looking forward to reading it now.Ishura gets 8 out of 10. characterisation for each member of the cast.

Nearly half the season has aired and it still hasn\'t begun to even attempt to weave a narrative... Each character if given a half to full episode of introduction and ""backstory"" but its mostly done through dialogue with a few flashbacks.What it has going for it:- Its a novel concept, maybe not all that original but definitely not overdone either.- Okay action scenes- Okay animation (when it isn\'t overusing CGI extremely poorly).What it does wrong:- It has too many characters to really be invested in them. Furthermore, once a character is introduced, we dont really see them again....At least not so far (again almost half the anime has aired).- There aren\'t really any humanizing aspects about any of the characters we\'ve seen so far. We are given no real reason to hate or love them.. not even any to like or dislike...- No cohesive storyline so far. It\'s pretty episodic. It is kind of hinting towards something but only extremely vaguely. Really strange for an anime that takes itself so seriously.Honestly, I feel like rating this a 3 is being EXTREMELY generous.The only people I recommend this to are teenagers who collect knives and think trench coats look cool.

The narrative unfolds gradually, with the first five episodes primarily serving as introductions to key characters. While this approach may initially feel disjointed, there's a deliberate effort in world-building, gradually unveiling the dynamics between two conflicting nations. Despite hints of a looming war and mention of a tournament, the plot remains elusive by episode six, leaving viewers to speculate on the overarching narrative.Story: 6.5/10In this anime you will be introduced to a world of dragons, knights, pirates, guns, robots, giant robots, magic, and more....While the characters are well-crafted, the narrative feels stagnant by the sixth episode. Despite glimpses of a promising plot, there are no significant developments. With five of the six episodes dedicated to introductions, viewers are left yearning for substantial progression. The cliffhanger in the sixth episode feels somewhat frustrating, because of anticipation for plot advancement. Nevertheless, the world-building shows immense potential, awaiting execution (Hopefully in episode 7) to truly captivate us and give us what we've been waiting for.Audio: 5/10The Japanese voice acting is commendable, yet the overall audio experience feels average. The music and sound design lack the impact needed to leave a lasting impression on viewers.Visuals: 7.5/10Ishura isn't afraid of gore, which personally adds to the allure of action animes in my opinion. The first episode we see a girl, who we are made out to root for, brutally killed. Fight scenes are skillfully executed, with the 3D CGI looking better than the cringe CGI of some other series. While not reaching the pinnacle of top-tier anime (Jujitsu Kaisen S2 or Demon Slayer S3), the visuals are captivating, particularly showcased in the first episode's fight scenes.Hype: 10/10The potential of Ishura is undeniable, with episodes 7-9 serving as make-or-break moments. The amalgamation of isekais, mecha robots, magic, and monarchy promises an enthralling experience. However, the delayed plot progression risks dissipating the hype surrounding the series, emphasizing the critical importance of forthcoming episodes.TLDR:Ishura offers a blend of character-driven storytelling and action-packed sequences, promising to engage viewers seeking both depth and excitement.

The series thus far has demanded attentive viewing, delivering on its promise of thrilling entertainment.Overall, Ishura holds immense potential, yet its execution on the plot will ultimately determine its success.

I say “may” because I'm not sure if the discussed topics count as spoilers. Although they are light, you have been warned. From here on out, the review contains things people said about Ishura.“A new seasonal isekai with no ecchi tags?!” I thought. “No way!” This was exactly what I wanted to watch, and the first episode was absolute perfection. Just like that, I'm hooked, eagerly awaiting the next episode...Next episode: “What is happening?”, “Who is the main character?”, “Where is the mc from the first ep?” These questions rained down on the anime, while the light novel readers tried...convincing people to keep watching. It's trying too hard. Is the payoff really that good? Sure.. let's wait another month and a half for the introductions to end and the fighting to start.It’s pretty safe to say that the story’s connectivity is absolutely abysmal. The concept is great, introducing new main characters every episode, but it’s executed in such a way that it leaves a bad taste. It would’ve been completely fine if they released it all at once, you could then just binge watch it all and actually remember the backstory of the characters they’re introducing. Only then would it be more acceptable to watch.The anime is missing a vital component any anime has to have, that being a connection between the main character and the viewer. Since we’re getting introduced to new main characters left and right, no real connection or affection is being built up. Many people won't care about these characters, as they're not relatable and little is known about their personalities. You can get a basic idea of how the main characters think, but it's not enough to drive the story forward. Kind of funny, but there’s pretty much no story to begin with.I get that the anime is all about a tournament at the end, and, to say the least, it works pretty well in the manga form. I’ve played a lot of Tekken, so it felt like what they were going for is similar to fighting games. In Tekken 7, for example, you play through the story mode, discovering new characters, each with a unique moveset. Then, you move to VS battles to play online or offline. Not many cared about the characters' backstories, but those who did had the option to enjoy discovering the lore. Now imagine Tekken, but you have to wait a whole week for a new part of the story to release, and only after it's complete can you see the action and enjoy the fights. That doesn't work, does it? That’s how watching Ishura feels right now. Why should I wait that long? Time is a priceless asset, and it feels like it’s being wasted, achieving nothing and having no fun.Animation plays a huge role in making a great anime. Unfortunately though, the CGI in Ishura is brutal. The first episode had some weird CGI, but it was so overshadowed by the epic story, characters, and all the chaos that it didn’t even matter. The second episode introduced wyverns with outrageous CGI, and it didn’t improve from there, only making the anime more uncomfortable to watch. That’s also when we find out the anime would introduce new characters every episode, making the episodes feel utterly disconnected from one another. I had to check if I was watching the right anime a couple times, because we kept going into episodes completely clueless. Nothing in a certain episode has to do with the previous one.Then there’s episode four, eagerly awaited by anime fans, also known as the “fan service episode”. I initially chose this anime because I thought it was an isekai (even though it has little to do with the isekai genre), but more importantly, it had no ecchi tags. Well, I was dead wrong. This episode was about 20 minutes long, and I kid you not, at least half of it was fan service. It featured a guardian lady and a girl in a hot spring, completely naked. These scenes are usually brief and skippable (also considered to be a side treat by many people) but for some reason, they decided to explain the entire magic system of the world in that setting. If you were interested in the magic system, you had to sit through more than 10 minutes of an attractive naked lady explaining it. Are the authors so unconfident in their anime that they had to include this to maintain attention? It's hard to take the explanation seriously when it's so distracting and uncomfortable to watch. There’s also no guarantee the anime doesn’t come back with more of these sorts of scenes in future episodes.That was the last straw for me. With everything combined, experiencing these last three episodes (2 to 4) was dreadful. I might return to watch the final episodes, AKA the tournament, but for now, I’m stepping away. I’ve had enough of its disjointed storytelling and random fan service. The chaos of the first episode was what originally drew me in, and the introduction of those two main characters was gripping. But sadly, it steered off course. Many people find this appealing, but it’s just not my cup of tea. convincing people to keep watching. It's trying too hard. Is the payoff really that good?

Many people find this appealing, but it’s just not my cup of tea."", 'Ishura - to fight to the bitter end, however who expected the ending to be just that?Meatgrinder, aka Battle royale, is a trope/genre that was popularized by Mirai Nikki and the Koushun Takami manga with the identical title in its heyday. Each author has a different take on this type of genre, but basically it\'s about creating a situation with a large number of characters who for some reason must survive and reduce their numbers as the story progresses. So what makes the difference between a good Battle Royale and a bad Battle Royale? Let\'s not get ahead of ourselves just yet and take...a look at two shows: Jigokuraku (aka Hell\'s Paradise), which got an anime adaptation in 2023, and a new show called Ishura, which we were treated to this past 2024 season.Ishura emerged as a web novel in 2017, and was even later acquired by ASCII Media Works under the guise of ""Dengeki no Shin Bungei"". The author of this creation is Keiso, a man who would go on to release a couple other works such as Gekitou in the future. Ishura received a warm welcome before the anime adaptation was announced, receiving good comments from critics, and in 2023 it was finally announced as an anime, produced by Passione, directed by Takeo Takahashi, and animated by Sanzigen, a studio that specializes in CGI graphics.Ishura is about creatures with powerful abilities that can be compared to demigods and even gods. The Demon King has been killed, but by whom - it is unknown. Now the now wandering souls of the heroes (aka Shuras) are free to do whatever they please, but the question of ""who killed the Demon King"" becomes cancerous for them, to the point that they decide to organize a contest like a gladiator battle to find out the true identity of the winner. Well, at least that\'s what Keiso, the author of the work, willed. The first season of the anime adaptation will adapt the first volume of the novel, and will focus on the story\'s characters and the political conflict between the Golden Capital and the self-proclaimed new principality of Lithia. There is no main character in this story, the plot focuses on all the characters, some of whom get screen time and reveal in an entire episode, as if to save their time. Accompanied by solving two major problems, solving a political dispute and finding Keiso\'s true hero, we are ""very happy"", I heartily apologize for the quotation marks, with battles as it should be.... battle royale?So, yes, Ishura is Battle Royale, and essentially the entire plot is a subplot to keep the viewer and reader in a state of anticipation of bloody battles and unforeseen moments. Battle Royale is good in that it allows the author to introduce a huge number of different characters and intelligently pit them against each other without depriving the rights of the target audience to enjoy the plot component at the same time. I\'ll call it the formula for a successful Battle Royale: spectacular battles + competent plot = good Battle Royale. For a perfect battle royale it is also necessary to have a logical conclusion of battles, balance, variety of characters, sharpness of the plot, but you do not think that all this is not in Ishura? Well, I won\'t be ironic, half of these things are really there. Back to the formula, does Ishura have the two main elements for a good battle royale? A competent plot is in place, even if it is a bit too rushed. The author brings us up to speed and does it very quickly, as if he is in a hurry, which makes our heads muddle after the first episodes. Spectacular battles? And there it is - the Achilles\' heel of this show. Good battle royale must give the consumer a lot of emotions from battles, because that is the beauty of the genre. Starting to consume the product you bet on your favorite characters, which after a while begin to collide with each other, from which the viewer\'s eyes literally begin to move apart. In contrasting Jigokuraku I was not mistaken about this, for this work observes two factors of the formula of ""good battle royale"". The heroes, having appeared on the island with the purpose of fulfillment of the task, collide with each other spectacularly showing their skills and skills of battles, though the main character, Gabimaru, was made horribly invincible. Ishura, on the other hand, leaves you anticipating the same thing - but ends up doing exactly the opposite. Instead of spectacular battles, we literally get death with a single blow. Predictable? Hell no, but how frustrating it can be. The show is able to reveal a character over the course of an entire episode, only to end up with no trace of him in a measly few minutes. Keiso may have been going for realism, but Battle Royale isn\'t about realism, it\'s about spectacle. Imagine if on a gladiatorial battlefield everything would end with one blow, would the audience like it? I doubt it. As a bottom line, Ishura has a good story, but as a source of epicness the show is very weak.Omitting the moments with battles I want to highlight the excellent work of the previously mentioned Sanzigen and animators, the picture is colorful and CGI animation is smooth and good. Character design is done at an excellent level, for which first of all we should praise Keiso. Each character has some zest in his appearance, thanks to which he stands out so well.The musical accompaniment in this show is worth a special attention, but the fact that such a musical potential was mercilessly drained is worth the tears shed. Throughout the episodes, there are various musical compositions that reflect the emotion of the scene well, and this is a credit to Masahiro Tokuda, the man who also wrote music for shows like Deca-Dence and Platinum End. The opening splash screen of Sajou no Hana\'s ""Shura ni Otoshite"" shows all the characters in turn, and is generally good, I especially liked the wyvern scene. Konomi Suzuki\'s ""Hakka"" was also good, but it wasn\'t too memorable or special.To summarize, I\'d like to say two of the most obvious things at this point about a show like Ishura. Battle Royale is a very handy tool for an author, but even with a hammer you need to know how to hammer nails so that they don\'t stick out crooked. I won\'t be pessimistic, but I don\'t have any hopes for a spectacular sequel, especially considering that there are already 10(!) volumes in the novel, it\'s scary to imagine where Keiso\'s imagination has gone. And the second most obvious thing is that if they would translate the rest of the volumes into English as soon as possible, it would be fun to see what would come out of it. a look at two shows: Jigokuraku (aka Hell\'s Paradise), which got an anime adaptation in 2023, and a new show called Ishura, which we were treated to this past 2024 season.Ishura emerged as a web novel in 2017, and was even later acquired by ASCII Media Works under the guise of ""Dengeki no Shin Bungei"".

The opening splash screen of Sajou no Hana\'s ""Shura ni Otoshite"" shows all the characters in turn, and is generally good, I especially liked the wyvern scene. Konomi Suzuki\'s ""Hakka"" was also good, but it wasn\'t too memorable or special.To summarize, I\'d like to say two of the most obvious things at this point about a show like Ishura. Battle Royale is a very handy tool for an author, but even with a hammer you need to know how to hammer nails so that they don\'t stick out crooked. I won\'t be pessimistic, but I don\'t have any hopes for a spectacular sequel, especially considering that there are already 10(!) volumes in the novel, it\'s scary to imagine where Keiso\'s imagination has gone. And the second most obvious thing is that if they would translate the rest of the volumes into English as soon as possible, it would be fun to see what would come out of it.', 'In first 5 episodes anime steadily introduce the key characters.

Yes, it does - this is also known as character building. I would also say that the world is also set-up and built-upon in these...first few episodes too.I might agree that the plot doesn\'t progress too much in these preliminary episodes, but I would argue that it would be extremely difficult to set-up the characters and world in the way they did, while also progressing the plot, all within an 18-min or so time-frame (taking out the OP and ED from the run-time).Speaking of the plot, even with the little we got in the first few EPs, we still understand that 2 countries are preparing for war, while one of them is also preparing a ""battle-royale"" style event to try to figure out who the strongest person in the world is, so it\'s not like we got absolutely nothing there.As of EP9, the main characters all seem to have been introduced and now we\'re delving more into the plot and the ongoing conflict between the 2 major countries.Now, this does mean I\'m going to agree that, realistically, this anime is not going to be complete as of EP12 and will likely feature major sequel-bait, with any potential (if) S2 then going on to focus more on the battle-royale. This season likely would have been far better off it it had 23-24 episodes, or had been announced with 2 cours (if it has, I didn\'t see it).However, that doesn\'t mean I\'m agreeing with the negative reviews, or the score this has. I find this anime to be very well presented artistically, has an interesting plot going on and all the characters are unique.Personally, I\'d say this anime stands out as one of the better ones airing this season, but apparently I\'m in the minority here.Recommended - 9/10 (Great) first few episodes too.I might agree that the plot doesn\'t progress too much in these preliminary episodes, but I would argue that it would be extremely difficult to set-up the characters and world in the way they did, while also progressing the plot, all within an 18-min or so time-frame (taking out the OP and ED from the run-time).Speaking of the plot, even with the little we got in the first few EPs, we still understand that 2 countries are preparing for war, while one of them is also preparing a ""battle-royale"" style event to try to figure out who the strongest person in the world is, so it\'s not like we got absolutely nothing there.As of EP9, the main characters all seem to have been introduced and now we\'re delving more into the plot and the ongoing conflict between the 2 major countries.Now, this does mean I\'m going to agree that, realistically, this anime is not going to be complete as of EP12 and will likely feature major sequel-bait, with any potential (if) S2 then going on to focus more on the battle-royale.

It\'s one of the weird tropes where victory is decided in one or two exchanges. The excuses being, when there is a clear gap between two fighters\' strengths, the fight would be settled quickly; and realistic fights, where both fighters go for the kill, don\'t go on for more than two or three exchanges. It\'s a very unpopular trope, obviously because we\'re all here to watch cool action of strong characters trading blows. Like imagine every boxing or MMA match always ends with a knockout in one exchange, no wrestle, no...dodges, no guard, people would be bored of it quickly. Two characters we\'ve spent multiple episodes being hyped up finally met, and their session ended in two blows. It\'s quite shocking ngl, because other fights lasted a little longer. The shock value is nice, but it also feels like a waste of time and buildup.Second thing, Ishura avoids writing likeable characters. Now, we all know likeable characters does not equal good character. I personally enjoy watching flawed, realistic characters, and I think Ishura did pretty well on that front. The main girl is absolutely pathetic and insufferable, but she represents the toxic POV of normal people in contrast to the superhumans, which is important to the plot\'s theme. Almost every core character in this show is an asshole and it makes sense because in a battle royale, the participants have to desire killing each other. Due to the large number of characters introduced, there aren\'t any complex or deeply developed characters, but that\'s not the focus of the show.Third thing, Ishura has an otherworldly theme that is not introduced properly. ""The True Demon King has died. The enemy of the world was defeated by somebody..."" Every episode starts with this line, but most of the time is spent on introducing core characters, rather than exploring the lore and implications behind this line. However, that does not directly degrade the viewing experience, it\'s kind of like a magic trick. There is no urgency to learn the lore because we\'re busy knowing the current characters and their situation. I think it\'s an interesting focus of the story.So far, despite several flops, I still feel Ishura is worth watching out for as it hasn\'t reached its full potential. Its fights are strategic and engaging. The characters are slightly deranged and interesting to follow. Whether Ishura is worth your time could depend on the next season and if you enjoy the slow burn. dodges, no guard, people would be bored of it quickly.

Despite dedicating a good half of the series just on establishing our characters, by the time the show was actually starting to move forwards in the back half of the season, I have to be honest I was pretty lost. They kept talking about some tournament or something, but in the end it ends up being more a political anime... I think? Just, keeping track of who was who, who was on whose side, what the motivations of...each side were - let alone the basic rules of how this world even worked. Yeah I was barely clinging on, to be honest.However, while that probably makes the show sound terrible, I want to make it clear, this complaint comes from a positive place, rather than a negative. It wasn’t like this world is alienating so I’m just gonna switch off and zone out. This is a world full of intrigue and the complaint comes from the fact that I wanted to learn more and understand better.Even if you don’t end up at that point, every episode would deliver at least one well animated, well produced and directed - and just straight up kick ass - action scene. Almost every character here is imaginative in concept either/and/or has some kind of imaginative ability set, so whenever characters clashed it always felt like a treat. I also appreciated that generally whenever characters seriously clashed, there was a definitive outcome. Like I’m genuinely surprised by how few characters ultimately made it out of this first season and it makes me wonder what they’ll do if they make more of this.So yeah, overall, kind of mixed on this. It is a very bingeable series because of its action, but with so much anime fighting your time always, it is kinda hard to give this a true recommendation. each side were - let alone the basic rules of how this world even worked.

From magical cannons that evaporate entire city districts, to swordplay between masters of the art....It is quite impressive.Furthermore, Ishura employs a large amount of gruesome gore. If you\'ve ever wondered how it would look if someone melted from the inside out, as their eyeballs popped out, you\'re in luck. That and many other gruesome scenes will be aplenty.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 7/10------------------------------------------I wasn\'t overly impressed by anything in the sound or music department. Everything seemed to be solid.Story - 8/10-------------The story of Ishura is very interesting, though its short run-time really hurts it, as it spends an extreme amount of time fleshing out numerous characters, which reduces overall plot coherency and world building.This may be one of the reasons for the low ratings here on MAL. The first half of the show is all but completely spent on fleshing out characters one by one, or in pairs. Meaning that the characters you see introduced in each episode, won\'t really show up again until everyone\'s introductions are done. This can make it harder to follow the story and get attached to the characters, as it\'s unclear who is the main character and who you\'re supposed to be cheering for.Nonetheless, I find the story to be very intriguing. Ishura features a fantasy world that is apparently open to ""visitors"". Basically super powerful individuals from our world that get isekaid into this one. The method of how it happens is unclear and the whole isekai aspect is largely ignored in the story beyond that.These visitors care little for the world of Ishura beyond seeking out powerful enemies to fight, so that\'s largely what we\'ll see happen in the show.There are hints of many greater storylines and worldbuilding yet to come, so it\'s clear that this first season is only a rudimentary introduction.Characters - 7/10---------------------It is a little hard to get a good handle on the various characters, since we are introduced to so many different important ones. Some of them get more backstory and screen time than others, but the show also isn\'t afraid to kill off characters they spend a lot of time on introducing.As a whole, the characters do seem to be well written and interesting. But one can only hope that future seasons limit the flow of new characters and instead spend more time fleshing out those who are intended to be there for the long run.---Total - 8/10---I find Ishura to be an underrated gem in the isekai category. Doing away with most of the isekai tropes, and instead focusing on great visuals with tons of gore.The first half of the season can be hard to follow, but the second half should hit all the buttons that any fan of the isekai battle genre would want.

Nope, EVERYONE is the MC, that's why this has like 4 episodes of character introduction because it makes you choose to root for someone who you think deserves to be the Hero. This is a battle royale with no MC. So abolish all the thought that you will be following someone's journey because you'll be following EVERYONE'S journey. It might be confusing at first, even I read a wiki page just to know who's on...the side of who in the war, but after you get through that, this is actually good. the side of who in the war, but after you get through that, this is actually good."", ""In a world where kids with 0 attention span consumes anime like fast food or fast fashion and only watches hyped shows with big titles like solo levelling for instance, this anime is truly a gem. Honestly the rating doesn't do justice to this anime at all.The storytelling is laid-back and coordinated well, It doesn't bombard you with unnecessary information and the world-building doesn't confuse you at all if you actually pay attention to what's on the screen.If you are not interested in at least getting to know the characters and connecting with them, then this anime is not for you. If you come here...looking for an anime with intricate and well thought of plot with twists, then this anime is also not for you.I would say the main highlight of this anime is how diverse the characters are from their appearance to their abilities and how interesting the world setting is in this anime.The synopsis sells it as a battle royale anime but i think the way this anime introduces its cast of characters are very much necessary and it will add to the excitement later. looking for an anime with intricate and well thought of plot with twists, then this anime is also not for you.I would say the main highlight of this anime is how diverse the characters are from their appearance to their abilities and how interesting the world setting is in this anime.The synopsis sells it as a battle royale anime but i think the way this anime introduces its cast of characters are very much necessary and it will add to the excitement later."", ""Animation 7/10\t\tMusic 5/10Story 6/10# StoryIshura presents an unusual story by presenting the story from a different perspective. This provides a new atmosphere considering the many plot armor scattered throughout many anime. with various perspectives from various characters can build the audience's emotional feelings. On the other hand, stories with various perspectives like this can also make you feel bored because the story process feels slow. because the many characters whose perspectives are told take up many episodes, and what is more disappointing is that the conflict when the war starts between Auretia and Lithia is not as tense as expected. the war ended quickly and...could not really be called a war. It's like watching One Piece when there is conflict in each arc, various perspectives of the characters and their respective opponents. but it doesn't have a satisfying climax. In One Piece the climax is always against the final boss. In Ishura there is no such climax. so it gives a minus value to the story# AnimationThe animation presented can be said to be good.

Therefore, my comment will genuinely be reviewing the anime and I will be interpreting it as how I see it.Story: The anime leaves a huge impression on what the story will be about in the very first episode as well as immediately highlighting what Ishura means in the context of the anime. The anime starts introducing multiple characters in quick succession and tells the viewer (via a narrator) who and what they represent in the story. In the first few episodes,...despite providing a lot of information to the viewer, it does not infodump anything on them. Since, by halfway through season 1, the anime will then only focus on the characters and geography that you have been informed about. From there the story will only use those characters and geography to slowly unravel the relationship between the characters, the political structure of the world, the geography of the world, etc. Throughout season 1 the anime segregates characters into two categories: powerful and normal. The powerful characters are labelled as ""Ishura"" (defined by the narrator) and the normal characters are then introduced for the sake of story progression.The story is really interesting since it acknowledges the difference in mentality between those who are strong to those who are weak. This is seen immediately in episode 1 and continues throughout to the end of season 1 in which we see a common pattern. The strong do what they wish and demonstrate it through their abilities whereas the weak will do anything to get what they want. This is then reflected in the difference in societal status between these characters where the majority of the ""weak"" characters are linked to government and political roles and the ""strong"" are like mercenaries. In addition, what makes Ishura iconic from the other animes similar to it, is that the ""strong"" characters gathered naturally. Every character\'s interaction is (surprisingly) influenced by the political nature of Ishura, thus many of the interactions between the strong characters feel like they came to each other just by circumstance. Moreover, it is interesting to see that despite the title being called ""Ishura"" the ones that run the show are not them, but all the other characters that are not described as such.To summarise, season 1 explains the meaning of ""Ishura"" and what it represents in its world and then demonstrates the strength of the characters (that are considered ""Ishura"") without feeling the information is being dumped onto you. In addition, it provides the viewer a clear understanding that not all Ishura are equals then leaves a cliffhanger saying there are more Ishura yet to appear.Characters: The characters that have appeared in the anime are easy to understand. As I have mentioned earlier, the anime tells you which characters are important for the season and will only show these characters for the whole season. Therefore, by the time the action starts, you are already familiar with all the characters presented. This season presents more than 10 characters and the anime does it well by providing each character the same amount of screen time. This enables the viewer to understand how each character behaves and where their morality lies in the world of Ishura. What makes this interesting is that the world of Ishura does not shy away from the fact that Isekaiers (people who travel to other worlds) exist and yet it does not see them as any more special than their already powerful characters.So far, season 1 has only shown one event with all the presented characters involved in it. This event does not entirely flesh out their characters since season 1 acts something like a prelude before any of the major events start to unfold - I presume season 2 may be the same. Therefore, it will be probably further down the line to see how these characters develop. For now, it is clear that the ""strong"" characters do not entirely run the show but it is the ""weak"" characters, and said characters have demonstrated that they will do anything to achieve their ambitions.Art and Sound: The animation done by the studio is high in quality, especially in the action scenes. Despite, some CG being used for some of the characters it adds more to it rather than detracting from it. The music for both the ending and opening are very nice to listen to and the lyrics for the opening somehow (I believe) fit to the theme of Ishura.Overall: Ishura is one of those animes in which (I believe) acknowledges the requirements for ""weak"" and ""strong"" characters together. The strong characters are the main attraction but the story can only progress because of the weak characters making use of their surroundings. Moreover, season 1 tries to convey the idea of ""strength"" to the viewer by introducing multiple characters that are ""strong"" in their area and then letting them interact with each for the viewer to compare their strengths. The end of season 1 gave the impression that there are more ""strong"" characters - Ishura - in the world of Ishura making me want to watch season 2 and hope that season 2 leaves just as an impression that season 1 did. despite providing a lot of information to the viewer, it does not infodump anything on them.

What made it work for me aside from the great production is the substantial story progression and thematic development. I am giving it a 7.5/10. It could have been an easy 8/10 if not for the sparse middle section.Expectation before watching: I knew nothing about the show or the light novel before watching the anime. I only had a vague sense about its generic isekai/fantasy setting which is the equivalent of toilet paper these days unless meaningfully differentiated from the run-of-the-mill stuff. I...think it\'s fair to say that I had little expectations for it.Actual experience: The 1st episode took me by surprise and hyped me for the rest of the show. As a huge fan of From Software games (the so-called ""Soulsborne"" games), the death-defying ""human player"" characters, the giant bosses whose every move is deadly, the tone of the world and the expectations for hidden bosses just clicked immediately with me. The middle section of the show can drag a little and come off as sparse, but the climax of Season 1, especially the more thoughtful final episode solidified the show as something for me to follow in the long-run.Recommended to: fans of the dark fantasy/action genre (e.g. Claymore, Berserk, etc.). Fans of Dark Souls games.What worked for me:++ Great and captivating pilot episode and 2nd episode. The fantasy battles are not only visually striking with lots of details, but also impactful, suspenseful and white-knuckled. The fundamental tone set by the initial episodes is dark but captivating. It\'s easy to brush it off as another generic fantasy battle royale with little substance, but I\'d encourage fans of action/medieval fantasy to give it a try.++ Great climax and surprisingly substantial conclusion. EP7-12 feature great battle sequences, generally good character conclusions and developments for the major players/stars of Season 1. What elevated the show above other suspenseful battle royale shows for me is EP12 which not only reframed the subtext and meaning of the main battles in Season 1, but also tie up all the seemingly sparse clues and character themes together in a captivating way. The new premise after EP12 differentiated the show from the generic isekai/fantasy battle royales which are essentially cynical cockfights on inflated power scales. In any case, I am looking forward to Season 2 with renewed interest.+ Generally solid VA performances and likeable star characters. The show casted many star VAs for the roster of characters in Season 1. Alus the 3-armed wyvern is a highlight for me. Supporting characters are not bad either.+ Great Ending theme song which is a good fit for Reina Ueda\'s Yuno, the tragic connecting character who opens and closes the show with strong emotions.What did not quite work for me:- Somewhat uneven production value between the start, the middle and the climax sections of the show. The middle section suffers from reduced budget, and it shows in some sequences.- Sparse character intros in the middle section without much story progression (EP3-6) can wear some audience\'s patience out, but those who sticked it out until EP12 are in for a treat.Conclusion: overall a solid show for what it is. think it\'s fair to say that I had little expectations for it.Actual experience: The 1st episode took me by surprise and hyped me for the rest of the show.

It reminded me of when Hunter x Hunter put in the numbers for power levels for like 2 episodes and then never mentioned it again. I then went back to it because a friend that...I trust finished the show and he didn\'t recommend it, but he said it wasn\'t the worst show he\'s finished.Overall this show is basically discount Fate, with very little of the characterization that actually makes Fate good for most people, and it shouldn\'t be suprising that I didn\'t like Fate Stay Night because of Kotomine, and this is very similar. I did like Fate Zero, and Ishura DEFINITELY isn\'t Fate Zero.For example, at the last episode, the show throws in a bullshit flashback to 1 year prior to the events that happened in ep 11 and just says ""Hey we\'re hoping for a tournament arc in season 2"" and then the rest of the episode cleans up SOME but not all of the loose ends from ep 11.The ending is completely dissatisfying because unlike Fate, there is no conclusive resolution to most of the characters+storylines and quite a few plot threads are dropped entirely:World Art girl\'s home is never explained, you don\'t get an explanation if the story of the one lone hero defeating the true demon lord is true or any of that stories\' characters, there is NEVER an explanation of the monarchy that controls Auretria(spelling) beyond ""Hey here\'s some ministers+the princess(?)"", the worlds that the random isekai\'d heroes come from is never explained, nobody\'s powers except the Word Art are even attempted to be explained, the whole thing with the hot spider girl and her being killed once already+made into a weapon+her not being a minian (human-ish) race is never explained, the list of minian races is never explained, why the labyrnth exists is never explained, they never properly explain that Bandit guy solved the Labyrnth puzzle+stole the prize sword and then escaped the boss fight with the giant mech, the history of why the wyverns weren\'t exterminated isn\'t explained, where the magic items came from, was there history to the countries before or after the demon lord thing, why does the setting of the entire story revolve around basically two countries (one of which is a rebel country of the first), nobody cares about the summoned heroes as special AFAIK, etc.Then there\'s the issues of the random flashbacks to cover up the holes in the writing that happen about once every 3-4 episodes, the bad writing, the annoying characters, lackluster CGI, and then random cool scenes that happen with the cold star laser.5/10 would not recommend I trust finished the show and he didn\'t recommend it, but he said it wasn\'t the worst show he\'s finished.Overall this show is basically discount Fate, with very little of the characterization that actually makes Fate good for most people, and it shouldn\'t be suprising that I didn\'t like Fate Stay Night because of Kotomine, and this is very similar.

I was incredibly excited for this show. I wasn\'t going in expecting much and yet oh how disappointed I became. The concept follows in the footsteps of Durarara, Baccano, and Odd Taxi. An ensemble cast, interwoven together, details from one story background are a major part of another.But the writing is so bad. It\'s flat, the characters sound mostly the same, the voice acting isn\'t bad but they don\'t make up for the writing. It\'s not just the translation because the words do fit. Perhaps its because all the character introductions are rushed? Or...is it BECAUSE of the ""everyone is a marry sue"" structure? Possibly the latter?The animation is not much better. I\'m not an expert, but the techniques used to fill time are glaring, and the techniques used to not have to animate action, especially for the not-swordsman, are even more campy than the character design except that the camp is the purpose of the character design and NOT a selling point for modern animation.Did  I enjoy it?

I initially checked it out on a whim due to interesting cover art, and then found that it weaves a complex and nuanced story of betrayal, mysticism/magic, strength, and creativity. It\'s understandable that people who only watched the first few episodes might find it dull as Ishura is one of those animes that you have to stick with and grow with to truly enjoy; taking time to appreciate the interesting characters and their dynamics with each other. Overall, my favorite aspect of Ishura is its world building and very other worldly and...magical atmosphere that\'s a mashup of so many different genres and time periods like the renaissance, steam punk, sci-fi/cyberpunk, Japanese history, and more.Ishura offers a surprisingly in depth analysis of its various character\'s feelings, whims, and relationships. It explores the dark side of these characters while exposing their motivations, whether they be righteous, apathetic, or evil, usually it\'s a combination of all of these things. The first character we\'re introduced to struggles with her perceived lack of strength due to previous trauma, and in turn takes this anger out on others in a strange roundabout way. There is the odd relationship between a sweet blind child and a demeaning, murderous wyvern. There are the conniving and scheming leaders of the different ""countries,"" each with their own motivations and reasons for their actions. The character development of this anime is some of the best I\'ve seen in a while, which is especially impressive for its short run time.There are certainly a few draw backs to Ishura, mainly related to it\'s seemingly smaller budget, but these things can easily be overlooked in regards to everything else that it excels at. Namely the animation is a bit poor, especially some of the fight scenes or the animation of certain animals/inhuman beings. The narrative can sometimes be incoherent or confusing, but this is more so due to just how complex the plot becomes and the interweaving of different character\'s journey in relation to the plot.I would highly recommend everyone to at least watch the first few episodes, it is truly a unique anime that takes the best of so many different genres and combines them into one magical and thrilling journey. magical atmosphere that\'s a mashup of so many different genres and time periods like the renaissance, steam punk, sci-fi/cyberpunk, Japanese history, and more.Ishura offers a surprisingly in depth analysis of its various character\'s feelings, whims, and relationships.

Other half was fast downhill. I dont mind how heros were shown but the story is bad. Author decided to pit one country against other and both of them have their champions but since the author decided outcome before anything started it become worse and worse. The difference between each country heros is GIGANTIC. Its like fight between big dog and small one. The scope of abilities makes watching it irritating. Im surprised in era of anime like Fate series you can actually made it this bad. Its just way to...one-sided, not to tell that characters appear out of nowhere, few times i was wondering how the hell did he/they got there? one-sided, not to tell that characters appear out of nowhere, few times i was wondering how the hell did he/they got there?', 'Ishura - A pseudo-Juuni Taisen, or a much closer reference, Record of Ragnarok?At first glance, novelist Keiso\'s Ishura sounds exactly like what many of you would be similarly comparing this to: mangakas Shinya Umemura and Takummi Fukui\'s Shuumatsu no Walküre a.k.a Record of Ragnarok, and you would be right in the broad sense: fighters from all walks of life gathering together for a fated battle that would redeem the last man standing as the triumphant winner regarded as a Hero. But, where the action-fantasy elements are what make both Record of Ragnarok and Ishura regarded similarly, Ishura has a finite twist to the series that...at least makes the foundation for a traditional battle royale and turning it into a high-stakes fight to the death...albeit with some hits and misses.(Cue the intro narration and music)""The True Demon King has died. The enemy of the fear that filled the world with horizons of fear, it was defeated by a lone Hero. To this very day, that lone Hero remains unknown, both in name and existence. With the age of fear coming to an end, that person has to be chosen. But even then, the powers left behind writhe in multitude, and they cannot be subdued by ordinary strength...the strength of 100 Shura-like demons.""These Shuras are basically demigod-like people who have the capability to bring down kingdoms and nations, and yet, they wander free to do whatever life takes them to. But with the lone Hero being an unknown figure, the Shuras now go head-to-head in a battle royale to determine who\'s the strongest and be given the Hero title. ""All the world\'s a stage, and the men and women merely players"" of Shakespeare\'s quote resides in the largest nation of Aureatia, governed by 29 Generals who are tasked to select that Hero, but its supposed ally of the independent city of the New Principality of Lithia has a different plan in mind, to be ruled by fear and terror, separate from Aureatia\'s democracy. And that\'s where the plot of the Hero takes shape in a bloody mess of a fight.Here are your candidates for the Hero title:- Soujirou the Willow-Sword, the one who is Isekai-ed from his own Distant World, who can defeat golems with his sword, and exercises excellent swordsmanship that reduces widespread legends into mere truths: the last swordsman, the minia a.k.a human Blade. Accompanied by a fellow minia, Yuno the Distant Talon, who\'ve lost everything from her previous inhabitant Nagan, to seek out revenge for those who\'ve tormented her life with golems wrecking the Labyrinth City.- Alus the Star Runner, the one who can handle weapons with exceptional aptitude, and possess unusual magic items, whatever the challenge is from labyrinths to enemies, he has conquered them all, surpassing all dragons: the Rogue wyvern. He has a close but strained relationship with the Hargent the Silencer, the 6th General of Aureatia, who saved him in his young self, but grew to the rebellious in the later stages.- Regnejee the Sunset Wings, the one who possesses a genius intellect and a sharp battlefield acumen, rooting himself within the core of a nition, and commands a fleet of wyverns who are obedient to him: the Command wyvern. He is frustrated at Alus for leaving the wyvern army, and seeks revenge for going rogue, who is close with Curte the Clear Sky, Taren\'s blind adoptive daughter.- Dakai the Magpie, the one like Soujirou, is a Visitor relative of the Distant World, and one who can stop bullets at the speed of sound with his remarkable eyesight and enchanted sword. And that\'s not all: his insight makes him valuable, as well as being a rebel in the most devious way: the minia bandit. He serves Taren the Guarded, once the 23rd General of Aureatia, and defected her way to form Lithia, seeking powerful Shuras to her rule.- Nihilo the Vortical Stampede, a girl enough to defeat an entire army, and kept under bars in Aureatia because she is a bioweapon of mass destruction: the revenant tarantula.- Kia the World Word, a young girl whose power perverts all laws of justice, who can dominate the world with a single word, but with her potential yet untapped: the wizard elf. She is taken care of by the 17th General of Aureatia, Elea the Red Tag, as a mentor of the kingdom\'s spy network, who proceeds like Taren to expand with greater allies, just like Lana the Moon Tempest which they would eventually meet for the same political agenda, but for Lithia instead.- Higuare the Pelagic, the one who has dealt through duels with poison that no ordinary human being can stop, and his bizarre physique doesn\'t stop his infinite brillant swordsplay, yet obeys all and ruled by none like a free slave: the Gladiator mandrake. He is accompanied by another Shura, Shalk the Sound Slicer, who is an undead skeleton mercenary hired under Lana\'s recruitment to serve Lithia.- Kuze the Passing Disaster and Nastique the Quiet Singer, the paladin assassin who works in tandem alongside the real Shura, who is an angel undetected and immune to interference to all but one, taking everything unseen as the embodiment of one: the Stabber angel.Feel overwhelmed at the number of characters? Well, too bad, because that\'s the definition of a battle royale to showcase as many characters as possible to show that anyone could easily achieve Hero status, no matter their origins or achievements thus far. It\'s one for the taking as Aureatia and Lithia experience turmoil of their own as they grasp getting as many Shuras as possible over to each\'s side, which unwillingly sparks a war on the outset against the respective democratic and authoritative leads of the two cities. It certainly is a battle royale at the heart of it, and a bloody mess Ishura is one that I\'m legitimately surprised at how it\'s able to capture the tension of a high-stakes death match scene, anytime, anywhere...that\'s if you can stomach through learning all of the Shuras involved, backstories included.In terms of production quality, studio Passione is definitely not one of the studios coming to mind when it comes to action-fantasy shows. That\'s only when you take into account of the studio\'s chief managing director of Takeo Takahashi\'s directorial role from Summer 2015\'s Rokka no Yuusha a.k.a Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers, alongside director Yuki Ogawa of Winter 2020\'s Interspecies Reviewers and Fall 2021\'s Mieruko-chan fame, then everything aligns together like cakework. The anime also having to integrate 3DCG animation from outsourcing to collab studio Sanzigen (i.e. BanG Dream! franchise), it\'s not the best, but it\'s certainly better than a studio trying to incorporate 3DCG by themselves, and then looking pretty bad. Sure, Keiso\'s LN may not be the best in the storytelling sense of having to put the characters first before the war showcase, but both directors took cues as much as possible to streamline the anime adaptation as it is, covering the characters for the 1st half, and then the rest of the story and plot for the 2nd half. It is what it is, so take it as you will about endurance when watching this show.The show\'s OST is decent, though it does give off a sense of unnervingness, given its dystopian setting with the typical fantasy that relates as such. Sajou no Hana\'s OP song, definitely fits the show\'s vibes for a rather dark and gruesome show and is terrifying good to listen to. On the other side of the spectrum, Konomi Suzuki\'s ED song certainly paints a path of a sliver of hope, but otherwise, just decent and fine.Sadly, Ishura as a show, being the way it\'s produced, it does not give and inspire confidence that its unorthodox way of storytelling is able to reel in people watching this show from its half-and-half character-plot methodology. However, that being said, if you can truncate through the character backstories, the plot will burst into a single colour: red, the colour of death, and make this show interesting from its own standpoint.Still though, give Ishura a chance if the plotline of the show doesn\'t deter you from watching an underappreciated show. at least makes the foundation for a traditional battle royale and turning it into a high-stakes fight to the death...albeit with some hits and misses.(Cue the intro narration and music)""The True Demon King has died.

With one dedicated episode for each character, it doesn't give you time to really build attachments to them so I could honestly care less if they were to die in whatever they're planning to do with them.Only thing that has me somewhat interested this long was the...setting. The time period as well as how they did their magic system was interesting to me and I enjoyed seeing those aspects. It's such a shame because it could've been at least a 6 for me if they didn't decide to pace the anime as they did just because of the setting alone.

But will this wild ride surpass its manga and light novel roots, or crumble under the weight of its own ambition?Forget your typical power-hungry demon king. Ishura’s world is ruled by a pantheon of demigods – a fencer, a lancer, a wizard, and an assassin vying for the title of “True Hero.” Sounds like a...D&D campaign gone rogue. Enter Yuno, our unassuming protagonist, living in a scholarly town built smack dab in the middle of the Demon King’s labyrinth. Life ain’t peaceful though, as earthquake-like tremors unleash robot hordes known as golems from the labyrinth’s depths.The first episode throws you a curveball faster than a Soujirou’s Willow Sword. Yuno witnesses her friend’s gruesome demise at the hands of robots, shattering any illusions of a gentle fantasy romp. Armed with “killing words” and a healthy dose of shock, Yuno barely escapes the metallic carnage.

Forget exposition dumps and hand-holding. You’re dropped into a world of cryptic pronouncements, alien concepts, and characters with motivations as opaque as the Great Labyrinth itself. This isn’t some isekai power fantasy; it’s a dark, mysterious odyssey where robots clash with ancient magic and heroes are forged in the fires of chaos.The jury’s still out, but the first episode is a thrilling gut punch. Ishura’s willingness to subvert expectations, embrace violence, and weave a web of unsettling mystery is a breath of fresh air in the often-tropey fantasy genre. Whether it surpasses the source material depends on how well it maintains this breakneck pace, fleshes out its enigmatic world, and avoids nosediving into incoherent madness.One thing’s for sure: Ishura is no timid light novel adaptation.

So buckle up, anime fans, because Ishura is here to take you on a wild ride to the dark side of fantasy.The first two light novels, while beautifully world-building, can feel like wading through a swamp of backstory and character introductions.

That’s why recently I watched “Come and See”, which disregards certain elements and characters from its narrative and stretches some scenes for the sake of presentation of its crazy and horrifying view on war, and “My Dinner With André”, where the director just had the two actors play...theatrical versions of themselves and write their own scripts and talk over a table for two hours.Ishura is a title that stands out for a similar reason, it has odd narrative choices, though nothing as extreme or clear as those movies, and unfortunately it doesn’t do the best of jobs in its results, thus is more interesting than it is good or enjoyable.-The series begins as the aftermath of the death of the major bad guy, kinda like the Virgin Soul sequel of Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis though differently and too bad Frieren was airing at the same time to take the spotlight with a similar setup, although also presented in a completely different way.-The anime is an isekai where warriors from some other world get transported to the one we follow throughout the whole season, yet never shows their lives before that, and it’s also among the few in recent memory that doesn’t work like a videogame nor has otaku pandering in it. It’s a fantasy world with its own way of how things work without conveniently functioning in a way that benefits the characters that aren’t from there.It has several types of energies and a language barrier, which are explained briefly and clearly in the first episode when a transported character asks about that to a native one. It doesn’t sound like much, but I don’t remember watching many recent isekai paying attention to such detail.-The premise presents the anime as a battle royale yet not in a way where everyone needs to fight against all the other characters but rather form teams, like in Drifters, or Fate/Apocrypha or Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku. Yet unlike those series, characters don’t conveniently switch teams nor is plagued by awful comedy like the first, it does not take place in a contemporary setting on which its events don’t make sense and every common person inexplicably remains ignorant about the whole thing like the second, and it doesn’t betray this element at the end like the third, where suddenly and only because of the villain being a troll, only one of the participants could survive.Heck, despite seemingly promising a battle royale tournament in the likes of many others, but most similarly like Record of Ragnarok or Tenkaichi: Nihon Saikyou Bugeisha Ketteisen, instead plays out in a slowly built war between two seemingly allied, or more accurately in a truce, nations that secretly confront each other in a way that’s not in the open and not many people know about, thus the whole thing doesn’t devolve into complete chaos. Basically, the major characters are part of an army of one of these countries, and they don’t fight in a closed arena nor do they follow rules, but rather on the battlefield or behind the scenes.-The weirdest choice in its storytelling is that it presents a narrative similar to the one in Juuni Taisen or Bokurano, where a character would get an episode dedicated to themselves to flesh them out. Yet unlike those anime, which would interrupt the tournament in the first or the alien invasions in the second for the sake of characterization, repeatedly and predictably whenever a character was about to die, Ishura does it in the buildup, as it dedicates half a season to show a different character or two at most and part of the setting on each episode, and without being just one of many alternative realities, nor finishing everything with a time reset and amnesia that renders the whole show pointless.On paper, this serves a purpose in detailed world building and characterization, on execution, however, the setting is not that original nor complex for that to be need to be done, and it meant following a series with a slow buildup and without a clear direction for half its runtime and number of episodes, something that at least nowadays not many would enjoy nor would be interested in to follow through to the end, which explains why this title was vastly ignored and received such a low rating.At least, this meant that once the introduction phase was over and the characters got together on a same place, the action was not interrupted for the sake of characterization through flashbacks like that Tenkaichi manga I mentioned earlier, or an ideological debate like in Fate/Zero, probably the most famous battle royale anime of all times.Despite the anime being about a war, and thus violent, and despite having some lighthearted moments here and there, visually and tonally is quite serious and not edgy and not very explicit, thus you more or less can accept its pretense of being mature. Oh, and no fanservice, that’s always worth the mention, as a positive.Finally, another good thing in the show is that not every major character is a human or humanoid from another world, here you have wyverns or skeletons or mandrakes from the world we follow as well, thus the setting doesn’t feel artificial or limited to familiar designs for the audience, and the conflict isn’t limited to characters that are essentially an extra part of it and all belong to the same species.The presentation itself isn’t very good however, evident on the mixed bag of exposition that this series has. Sometimes a character that doesn’t know about something or someone would ask of another to explain that, and the explanations are followed with simple and clear visuals, so that counts as decent to good exposition.Other times, however, characters that are supposed to know certain stuff or another one from long time ago, would ask them, or tell the other, about said stuff or themselves in cheap ways, just for the viewer to know, or even the narrator himself would appear to tell us something about a character that could be shown instead, and that counts as plain bad exposition.Another issue is the power scaling, since, as it happens on most other battle royale series, some characters are simply way more powerful than others. Over here you have some that are exceptionally good at using some kind of weapon or have deadly abilities alright, but there are two that literally can kill anybody passively or just by wishing it, how can anyone else even compare? I mean there is still tension and battle choreography, but no one would believe that those two would lose unless they fought each other, and the showdowns are usually quite short.And since this anime is based on a rather recent series of light novels and/or an even more recent manga, both of which are still on-going, there is no ending, thus you followed a series that’s half a slow buildup with no clear direction, and half short fights with some characters that are clearly more overpowered than others, with some payoff but no ending.And there are also a lot of characters, yet most of them aren’t very interesting to follow:-Soujirou, a young samurai that’s basically a battle freak and somehow is able to fight against supernatural creatures despite being a human from our world.-Alus, an ambitious light blue wyvern that ran away from the others with legendary weapons but otherwise doesn’t have much going on in it.-Nihilo, a femme fatale type of spider-like artificial humanoid war machine that fights for negotiating its freedom, but doesn’t get much spotlight.-Kia, a clueless young girl with one of the most overpowered abilities in the series, she is just unknowingly used by others.-Kuze, a completely passive and chill dude with one of the most overpowered abilities in the series that’s otherwise uninteresting, even Kia is more interesting to follow.-Shalk, just a seemingly immortal skeleton/undead in for the money.-Dakai, just another battle freak but at least he is used as an assassin in hide and hunter of possible traitors.The only fighters I cared about in the show were:-Regnejee, a tsundere red wyvern that fights so his species can stay and live and eat in one of the nations at war, he maintains peace between his species and humans or whatever they are called in this series, and gets to care about a blind girl that later on is suspected of being a traitor.-Higuare, a former gladiator mandrake that constantly learns about itself and others.Ironically, I ended up finding the support cast more interesting for having secret agendas and wanting to use the warriors in one way or another:-Hidow and Taren for being the people behind the war and the ones recruiting all the warriors, with the second being the more interesting for having more spotlight and being more proactive and wanting to establish her own nation and being ruthless enough to spark the actual war in the open past the middle point of the show.-Curte, a blind girl adopted by Taren that befriends Regnejee and is seemingly being manipulated by a traitor.-Lana and Elea for recruiting warriors and being secret agents that want to kill Taren, with the second one being probably the most interesting character in the whole show for intending to betray everyone.-Yuno, a girl that loses her town and everything in the first episode and acts as a guide for Soujirou yet secretly is out for revenge and wants him dead along with every other powerful warrior. She blames everyone for her loss yet also herself, as she accepts her own weakness and the wrongdoings of her town as the series goes on.There are more characters but they are only interesting or important when they interact with someone else and otherwise not that relevant nor fleshed out on their own.Unfortunately since every major character is initially looked into when apart from the rest, whenever they finally encounter they just fight and otherwise don’t have any kind of interesting interactions or dynamics between them. Nobody truly develops besides perhaps Yuno and even then just very little, and there is no catharsis anywhere for anyone.Aesthetically, Ishura is just as an oddball as it is in writing, since it combines characters with mecha-like machines or weapons and different types of clothes in what seems to be a typical fantasy setting. I mean look at Soujiro with his casual contemporary clothes despite being a samurai from long ago, or Kia who uses a hoodie. Like I said earlier, there is an explanation, but some people will probably find it unfitting for the setting or not like the mix.The opening is a typical jpop/jrock song and the ending is unfittingly relaxing, while the background music combines typical fantasy-like themes, epic choirs and orchestras, and some metal and even some electronic music tunes, again, it’s weird, and I don’t find it to be that great, but it’s good enough.Aesthetics aside, I don’t think the production would please many viewers. The artwork itself is fine and the backgrounds are good, but the special effects are of lower quality, especially the CGI, and the artwork looks…I don’t know, like there’s sand on the screen, I guess? Like, again, Drifters, or if any of you remember it, Angolmois, though it’s better here and it makes more sense because a big part of the series and setting takes place over places surrounded by sand.The motions are limited and not very good most of the time, yet out of nowhere there can be a very well made and directed action scene, yet nothing on par with the fight of the first episode.The sound effects are great, very impactful and immersive, and the voice acting is done by very famous and experienced or plain veteran voice actors and actresses, some of which surprised me with the unusual performances that they pulled here. As a whole I would dare to say that Ishura has one of the best audio departments I’ve heard in recent years.Down to it, this anime was kind of an interesting experiment to follow and I definitely hold it higher than the titles I compared it with and most battle royale I came across with, but not one I enjoyed nor would be thrilled to watch more of, and even less one I would see becoming very popular or loved by many people, and not an actually good isekai like Twelve Kingdoms or The Vision of Escaflowne, but for those who want something a little bit different, this is not a bad choice even though it can be quite boring and require some patience. theatrical versions of themselves and write their own scripts and talk over a table for two hours.Ishura is a title that stands out for a similar reason, it has odd narrative choices, though nothing as extreme or clear as those movies, and unfortunately it doesn’t do the best of jobs in its results, thus is more interesting than it is good or enjoyable.-The series begins as the aftermath of the death of the major bad guy, kinda like the Virgin Soul sequel of Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis though differently and too bad Frieren was airing at the same time to take the spotlight with a similar setup, although also presented in a completely different way.-The anime is an isekai where warriors from some other world get transported to the one we follow throughout the whole season, yet never shows their lives before that, and it’s also among the few in recent memory that doesn’t work like a videogame nor has otaku pandering in it. It’s a fantasy world with its own way of how things work without conveniently functioning in a way that benefits the characters that aren’t from there.It has several types of energies and a language barrier, which are explained briefly and clearly in the first episode when a transported character asks about that to a native one. It doesn’t sound like much, but I don’t remember watching many recent isekai paying attention to such detail.-The premise presents the anime as a battle royale yet not in a way where everyone needs to fight against all the other characters but rather form teams, like in Drifters, or Fate/Apocrypha or Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku. Yet unlike those series, characters don’t conveniently switch teams nor is plagued by awful comedy like the first, it does not take place in a contemporary setting on which its events don’t make sense and every common person inexplicably remains ignorant about the whole thing like the second, and it doesn’t betray this element at the end like the third, where suddenly and only because of the villain being a troll, only one of the participants could survive.Heck, despite seemingly promising a battle royale tournament in the likes of many others, but most similarly like Record of Ragnarok or Tenkaichi: Nihon Saikyou Bugeisha Ketteisen, instead plays out in a slowly built war between two seemingly allied, or more accurately in a truce, nations that secretly confront each other in a way that’s not in the open and not many people know about, thus the whole thing doesn’t devolve into complete chaos. Basically, the major characters are part of an army of one of these countries, and they don’t fight in a closed arena nor do they follow rules, but rather on the battlefield or behind the scenes.-The weirdest choice in its storytelling is that it presents a narrative similar to the one in Juuni Taisen or Bokurano, where a character would get an episode dedicated to themselves to flesh them out. Yet unlike those anime, which would interrupt the tournament in the first or the alien invasions in the second for the sake of characterization, repeatedly and predictably whenever a character was about to die, Ishura does it in the buildup, as it dedicates half a season to show a different character or two at most and part of the setting on each episode, and without being just one of many alternative realities, nor finishing everything with a time reset and amnesia that renders the whole show pointless.On paper, this serves a purpose in detailed world building and characterization, on execution, however, the setting is not that original nor complex for that to be need to be done, and it meant following a series with a slow buildup and without a clear direction for half its runtime and number of episodes, something that at least nowadays not many would enjoy nor would be interested in to follow through to the end, which explains why this title was vastly ignored and received such a low rating.At least, this meant that once the introduction phase was over and the characters got together on a same place, the action was not interrupted for the sake of characterization through flashbacks like that Tenkaichi manga I mentioned earlier, or an ideological debate like in Fate/Zero, probably the most famous battle royale anime of all times.Despite the anime being about a war, and thus violent, and despite having some lighthearted moments here and there, visually and tonally is quite serious and not edgy and not very explicit, thus you more or less can accept its pretense of being mature. Oh, and no fanservice, that’s always worth the mention, as a positive.Finally, another good thing in the show is that not every major character is a human or humanoid from another world, here you have wyverns or skeletons or mandrakes from the world we follow as well, thus the setting doesn’t feel artificial or limited to familiar designs for the audience, and the conflict isn’t limited to characters that are essentially an extra part of it and all belong to the same species.The presentation itself isn’t very good however, evident on the mixed bag of exposition that this series has. Sometimes a character that doesn’t know about something or someone would ask of another to explain that, and the explanations are followed with simple and clear visuals, so that counts as decent to good exposition.Other times, however, characters that are supposed to know certain stuff or another one from long time ago, would ask them, or tell the other, about said stuff or themselves in cheap ways, just for the viewer to know, or even the narrator himself would appear to tell us something about a character that could be shown instead, and that counts as plain bad exposition.Another issue is the power scaling, since, as it happens on most other battle royale series, some characters are simply way more powerful than others.

I honestly only want to see him i want the story to follow him, he is actually interesting and all the other ones are just weird brother what is this. This anime has no clear path, its just all over the place you cant even follow with a ""main character"", I personally think anime made with multiple main characters like this is just useless. ', ""The series gets off to a great start that really showcases the power and skill of a champion against a giant golem and placing them in the context of a world that is composed of fragile beings. Given the promise of a tournament featuring a set of characters like this one, it certainly set itself up for success.…but it’s mostly downhill from there. There are some really good fights later into the series run as various otherworldly characters come into conflict with other powerful beings (many of whom would be participants in a future tournament that would necessarily pit them against one another anyway), where...they really get to strut their stuff against calamities, sometimes in epic fashion.However, that’s not the focus of most of this season. Instead, we focus in on a conflict between the Aureatia Kingdom and the New Principality of Lethia, which… is not what I came here for. I love a good war story, but you’ve introduced characters whose functions in the story render most militaries moot. You’ve established that most of this world is made of soggy cardboard compared with these fighters and introduced them with the promise that there will be a tournament used to determine who is the strongest. Telling your audience to care about the normal humans at this point just seems like an attempt to get us to care about doomed characters so their deaths can hit us that much harder, but what it does for me is make most of the deaths ring hollow. Even deaths of named characters just don’t matter much. The series does scant little to get us to care about its relationships, mainly just showing us “backstory” through brief glimpses into the past that barely help us connect with them, and that’s the best-case scenario.But then there’s all the other elements. When a series leaves me with this many questions and only the barest of hints at the answers, I start to wonder why I should stay invested. This is a world in which the Demon King, widely agreed to be the most powerful and terrible being on the planet, was killed. Everyone assumes it’s one of these champions who did it. Fine. Now they want to hold a tournament to determine who the hero was that killed the Demon King. I guess they assume that whoever is the strongest must have done it and they want to reward them, but a) this seems far more likely to kill whoever the actual hero was, especially since just announcing the tournament guaranteed the kind of free-for-all kill fest that has resulted beforehand (especially considering just how diverse the sets of powers are), b) the fact that said hero hasn’t come forward means they’re pretty unlikely to take part in a tournament meant to uncover their identity, and c) that’s compounded by these characters requiring some national representation, which may just leave out the hero even if they wish to compete. Maybe they just don't care who killed the Demon King and just want a tournament for the sake of eliminating a bunch of these powerful beings and posting a figurehead - that's true for at least some of the stakeholders - but if that's the case, that just raises further questions about why they're doing it this way. Why couch any of this in the Demon King if you don't even care who killed him? Wouldn't this just result in a single powerful individual (or a small group of them) that no one can possibly defeat and that can take over by default?Who these champions really are, where they came from (it’s only lightly hinted at), and why they arrived in this place are all up in the air. Much of the reveals deal in the warfare between the two countries instead, but even so, there’s so much we don’t know and this enigma is the kind that only serves to frustrate rather than intrigue. If you’re going to dedicate so much of your plot to these elements, the lack of a reason for them only serves to disengage your audience.Beyond that, there are several other characters who have their own machinations in play, so there are all kinds of political power games going on that have little to nothing to do with the broader plot. Combine all that with a magic system that somehow gets specifically defined while simultaneously feeling almost entirely useless and a world that feels surprisingly small despite a broad variety of characters and environments, and what you get is a good seed of an idea that both feels like it’s been dramatically overcomplicated in many ways and overly simplified in others. And I haven’t even mentioned the CGI, which does look pretty bad in places. It’s not awful, but it does detract from opportunities to make the most of this series’ sakuga.I don’t mean to make this series come off like a complete mess, it’s just a lot of interesting ideas that are thrown together haphazardly and result in a product that is less than the sum of its disparate parts. It does not help that the last episode suggests a lot of plots at play that just seem to make less sense the more you think about them. It’s the kind of show that prefers to use much of this season as setup for interesting stuff down the line, and while it might eventually get there, I don’t think that’s a substitute for engaging your audience early and often. Whether they’re talking about the period before the story where someone fought the all-powerful Demon King or the period after this season where an actual tournament is set to happen, everything sounds more interesting and narratively satisfying than this. As someone who is not a fan of series that seem to put off the good stuff in hopes that you'll be just hooked enough to see it through to the end, I can't recommend this one. they really get to strut their stuff against calamities, sometimes in epic fashion.However, that’s not the focus of most of this season.

It's a kids anime through and through.The art is pretty good. The reason I got attracted to the anime was because of the art. The art is perfect for younger people, not so detailed like anime we adults watch.At times it is boring and you might just want to get the episode over and done with. I think it's suposed to be...funny but I just didn't laugh. I couldnt get into it at all, but I do admit its not bad.Its really difficult to write a review about this anime. Everything was a 5/10 and it's not appealing enough. Maybe a kid would love this, but its just lame if u watch a bunch of school kids being kids and no surprises.I think this would be a waste of your time unless you love anime like Kamisama Minarai. funny but I just didn't laugh.

Itou Junji: Maniac,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52031/Itou_Junji__Maniac,"['Do yourself a favor and just check out Ito’s manga. This adaptation is done by much of the same staff as the abysmal Junji Ito Collection and comes with all of the same problems. Everything feels so flat, bland, and careless that I could barely force myself to finish it. All of the detail and dread from the manga is gone, and we’re left with a subpar mess of an adaptation again. Feels like a cheap cash grab at best.The shoddy animation undermines a lot of the payoff scenes, and the lack of detail is all the more noticeable when compared to the source...material. Anything but a closeup on a character’s face looks muddy at best. Backgrounds are overly simple and the palette does little to add any atmosphere or emotion to the scenes. Characters are noticeably expressionless and do nothing to convey the distress and horror of the situations they find themselves in. Honestly, many scenes that are meant to be horrifying just look, well, pretty boring.Here’s hoping Adult Swim’s Uzumaki adaptation is worth the wait, because this show just isn’t any good. material.

Honestly, many scenes that are meant to be horrifying just look, well, pretty boring.Here’s hoping Adult Swim’s Uzumaki adaptation is worth the wait, because this show just isn’t any good.', 'In case you want to watch only the worthy shorts, here\'s a review of each one of them with a summary if you want to watch all of them.""The Strange Hikizuri Siblings"": 3/10I couldn\'t get into this one, too many annoying characters for an annoying plot, not the best to start with. At least we\'re immediately presented with more quality than the previous adaptations. The animation sometimes feels better, the colors are better, lights, movement, but yeah, not a good story.""The Story of the Mysterious Tunnel"": 4.5/10Not a bad one, but can\'t reach being decent. It\'s just a little spooky story that crescendos with goofy...animation that I couldn\'t take seriously. A problem with Junji Ito stories, is how it uses manga to its maximum potential. Moments allow imagination to thrive; sounds to exist inside one\'s head, the monsters moving as terrifyingly as you think about it. Sometimes, adding color and an okay presentation can\'t compensate for everything else. I do like some of the foreshadowing elements, how fear is revealed slowly, but surely.""Ice Cream Bus"": 4/10This one is simply really weird, and not because of the premise itself, I did like where it was going, feeling a horrible disturbing sensation. Sadly, what happened was way, waaaay less messed up than what I thought. I felt like one of those weird, nonsensical endings that Ito likes. It can work and most probably the manga felt a little bit more intense, but this isn\'t that good in general. Another middle of the road one.""Hanging Balloon"": 5/10Watching this one was just sad. I\'ve heard the hype around this little story for such a long time. Not finding the time, it stayed in my list until today and, well, sure, story is good. The animation, on the other hand, terrible. Those moments of horrible, foreboding visuals coming, surpass when they actually show us. Having so much build-up, and moments of anticipation, only to look at silly 3D animation of the balloons, or the bodies hanging, moving like ragdolls from gmod.The music choices ruined the tone of some of the creepier scenes, and really, this ends up being the biggest wasted potential to one of those ""end of the world"" Ito stories.""Four x Four Walls"": 5/10I had fun with it. Sometimes Ito manages to create a stupid story with some really weird moments and aesthetics. Character designs being uncomfortable without anybody noticing, situations making no sense, but the people react as if it\'s an inconvenience. It feels like a David Lynch comedy, that isn\'t totally to my liking, but I appreciate this one.""The Sandman’s Lair"": 8/10One of, if not, the best one. Almost no music, a different aspect ratio, giving a nice, special aesthetic. The colors feel overexposed, like the 2000s animation sphere. It all feels perfect to a certain aspect, only with some animation problems. Most of this short simply feels like a cosmically strange, and still, sensical story about losing yourself and everybody else. I loved almost everything about this one.""Intruder"": 5.5/10Well, I would\'ve liked some closure. Not a bad premise, effectively animated, interesting concept, even with the typical uncharacteristic Ito characters. The execution of everything is the overarching problem. The dimensional elements not only serve for a bigger story, but the fact that it\'s so short whiplashes you into knowing you just got 1/5 of a story. Not even a climax, twist, just a random situation that ends up back in square one without even consequences. I can\'t find anything terrible about it, but I didn\'t like it that much.""Long Hair in the Attic"": 9/10Characters, just what I need in this fucked up world. It\'s not easy to grow sympathetic towards characters you know will suffer soon. I really loved this premise, this realistic depiction of long-lasting relationships, promises, choices. Nothing mattered in the end; the same thought personifying itself into the monster of the story. Vengeance against the one who promised everything and gave nothingness.I like that there isn\'t entirely horrible characters, since we know for a fact the guy who broke off the relationship knew the girl really well. Small little details as ""This is the sound of her teeth"" feel like such a tiny thing that spells out so much, coupled with great and creepy sound design. Obscuring characters and scares, the horror was effective, and the ending was perfect. I love this one in every sense, except for some art looks.""Mold"": 6.5/10I like mold. Solid animation, solid story, solid everything. This is the most competent one so far, but it doesn\'t get out of its way to excel. Itchy storytelling with great visuals and really gross ideas that work with its lack of lighting in the Ito style. Can\'t say much, it\'s just nice to see one I can\'t get angry at in any way.""Library Vision"": 7/10Stylistically, the most beautiful one, in a strange way. Much more about visual storytelling, about dialogue attention, character driven. The titular library feeling as the curse of knowledge, led by trauma or obsession leading to one\'s downfall. It felt melancholic, strangely sad, all around, it looked really great. The changes in visuals feel the best in this compilation.""Tomb Town"": 9.5/10Almost perfect, just almost, but damn. Akin to the ""Paranoia Street"" manga, with a touch of the ""Four by Four Walls"" episode; this one feels like a town where a strange rule exists and people act normally around it, with much more sad connotations. Hospitals react in certain ways against this rule, moving people from their deaths means much more, and the accident the main characters suffered creates this ambience of tension.This story feels like guilt being splattered onto the culprits of an accident, leaving nothing but hatred for themselves, nightmares and consequences for the people involved. Nobody is saved, nobody gets closure properly, they just live with it, or end it. This is how you do the open ending. Now what holds it back from a 10, is the monster 3D animation, which I get, it would take too many resources, but yeah, I adore everything else.""Layers of Terror"": 7/10The other kind of Ito protagonists, batshit insane when revealed with a new rule in life. A concept is introduced, and somehow something within that concept happens that gives it a new meaning when it happens with a person. The metaphor happens, unfathomable horror is seen, in the end, consequences befall the characters. I can\'t say it doesn\'t work, it feels like the Ito formula of his best stories. Not bad, I\'m just accustomed to it.""The Thing that Drifted Ashore"": 3/10Maybe it ended there, but man, this didn\'t even let its own concept grow or anything. This was like a small documentary in an alternate reality, one that we\'re shown around 10% of. Something horrid is presented, well, the end, hope you enjoyed. I wish we could\'ve stayed a tad bit longer.""Tomie・Photo"": 6/10As a fan of the Tomie manga, I enjoyed this little piece of the story, even if it isn\'t the best part of it. The beginning of the Tomie story seems like the best place to start, so why not start there? Strangely enough, if you\'ve read the manga from beginning to end, it feels coherent, the visuals feel in place, but since we don\'t get context, it feels as if it comes out of nowhere. Fans will like this one, but newcomers, I don\'t think so.""Unendurable Labyrinth"": 2/10Just boring. I didn\'t feel any horror from this one, since it ruins the essence of how a manga works. The page turn isn\'t there, the build-up to a horror moment gets taken away, and sound effects only manage to eliminate the tension of certain moments. I don\'t feel like I\'m watching something silly, not even an interesting premise. People scream, horror situation happens without horror or importance. The worst as of now.""The Bully"": 6/10I don\'t know how to feel about this one entirely. The story started out wonderfully, with characters you hate, and one you root for, devolving into subtly disturbing. The twist of the flash-forward works really well, and we have a circling story from beginning to end. However, why did that ending feel so much more strange than usual? Maybe the fault of the art style, since black on white can function, but adding those colors to the face removed the horror, just leaving me feeling disappointed about the whole thing.An ending that cannonball\'s you into not being able to take what happened seriously.""Alley"": 4/10Too simple, too obvious, I just didn\'t like how generic this horror story was. Like one of those dumb urban legends from neighbors to scare you. Not much to say, just a bit boring, with at least situations that feel sincere with the context.""Headless Statue"": 3/10When consuming so much of Junji Ito at a time, stories like this don\'t excel at practically anything, and since the horror isn\'t really, well, scary; nothing works that well to become interesting. Not that good in my opinion.""Whispering Woman"": 10/10Junji Ito, simply making life a living hell. It seems characters flip-flop around being nothing sandwiches to great characters worthy of analysis and love. There was no monster, there was no extreme horror to couple this tragic situation, we only had people in terrible situations finding respite with each other. Eventually, another tragedy strikes, and somehow, this depiction of mental illness managed to get an actual scare out of me, with simple sound design. After not hearing that voice for so long, we get that eternally devastating idea of the dead making an impression on us, as well as imprinting hatred into the living.This is the absolute best. We didn\'t need great animation, or a monster to accompany horror, it\'s just about those visuals and ideas that make it feel all the more distressing. A tragedy, with a sad conclusion.""Soichi\'s Beloved Pet"": 5/10A much lighthearted Lynch comedy that leaves everything on an okay note. I wish we had this episode somewhere else, since the previous one was the best of them all, at least in terms of story. However, I don\'t hate this little recurring plot; slightly funny, slightly silly, with the touch of surrealist horror, can\'t despise it.Overall, 5.7/10A mixed bag of stories, ranging from the bad, okay, to amazing. I liked going through all of them, and I enjoyed everything enough to appreciate the attempt to adapt such a strange author, with his strange little stories. animation that I couldn\'t take seriously. A problem with Junji Ito stories, is how it uses manga to its maximum potential. Moments allow imagination to thrive; sounds to exist inside one\'s head, the monsters moving as terrifyingly as you think about it. Sometimes, adding color and an okay presentation can\'t compensate for everything else. I do like some of the foreshadowing elements, how fear is revealed slowly, but surely.""Ice Cream Bus"": 4/10This one is simply really weird, and not because of the premise itself, I did like where it was going, feeling a horrible disturbing sensation. Sadly, what happened was way, waaaay less messed up than what I thought. I felt like one of those weird, nonsensical endings that Ito likes. It can work and most probably the manga felt a little bit more intense, but this isn\'t that good in general. Another middle of the road one.""Hanging Balloon"": 5/10Watching this one was just sad. I\'ve heard the hype around this little story for such a long time. Not finding the time, it stayed in my list until today and, well, sure, story is good. The animation, on the other hand, terrible. Those moments of horrible, foreboding visuals coming, surpass when they actually show us. Having so much build-up, and moments of anticipation, only to look at silly 3D animation of the balloons, or the bodies hanging, moving like ragdolls from gmod.The music choices ruined the tone of some of the creepier scenes, and really, this ends up being the biggest wasted potential to one of those ""end of the world"" Ito stories.""Four x Four Walls"": 5/10I had fun with it. Sometimes Ito manages to create a stupid story with some really weird moments and aesthetics. Character designs being uncomfortable without anybody noticing, situations making no sense, but the people react as if it\'s an inconvenience. It feels like a David Lynch comedy, that isn\'t totally to my liking, but I appreciate this one.""The Sandman’s Lair"": 8/10One of, if not, the best one. Almost no music, a different aspect ratio, giving a nice, special aesthetic. The colors feel overexposed, like the 2000s animation sphere. It all feels perfect to a certain aspect, only with some animation problems. Most of this short simply feels like a cosmically strange, and still, sensical story about losing yourself and everybody else. I loved almost everything about this one.""Intruder"": 5.5/10Well, I would\'ve liked some closure. Not a bad premise, effectively animated, interesting concept, even with the typical uncharacteristic Ito characters. The execution of everything is the overarching problem. The dimensional elements not only serve for a bigger story, but the fact that it\'s so short whiplashes you into knowing you just got 1/5 of a story. Not even a climax, twist, just a random situation that ends up back in square one without even consequences. I can\'t find anything terrible about it, but I didn\'t like it that much.""Long Hair in the Attic"": 9/10Characters, just what I need in this fucked up world. It\'s not easy to grow sympathetic towards characters you know will suffer soon. I really loved this premise, this realistic depiction of long-lasting relationships, promises, choices. Nothing mattered in the end; the same thought personifying itself into the monster of the story. Vengeance against the one who promised everything and gave nothingness.I like that there isn\'t entirely horrible characters, since we know for a fact the guy who broke off the relationship knew the girl really well. Small little details as ""This is the sound of her teeth"" feel like such a tiny thing that spells out so much, coupled with great and creepy sound design. Obscuring characters and scares, the horror was effective, and the ending was perfect. I love this one in every sense, except for some art looks.""Mold"": 6.5/10I like mold.

I liked going through all of them, and I enjoyed everything enough to appreciate the attempt to adapt such a strange author, with his strange little stories.', 'An Anime that has nothing to offer either Horror fans, or Junji Ito fans.As of writing, I\'ve only been able to stomach two episodes of this show, with no further desire to continue it- beyond the morbid curiosity as to how bad the rest of the episodes truly are. I will try my best to give spoiler-free impressions on what I forced myself to witness down below...Whilst most likely not a representation of the show as a whole, the first episode ""The Strange Hikizuri Siblings"" is a text-book example of how to turn away your viewers in an instant.This episode is based around a...supposed colourful cast of characters, of whom do have very distinguishable personalities from one another- but let\'s not get this misconstrued with the cast actually being ""good"". Each of the characters personalities are surface level at best, which is understandable given the short 20-ish minute runtime of each episode, however the issue I have here lies in how the show tries to compensate for that. In order to make these characters ""entertaining"", the show decides to exaggerate their personalities to a level which I considered to be obnoxious. If you enjoy hearing a child constantly screeching for 20 minutes, then this truly is the episode for you- though I\'d like to think you\'re the exception and not the rule.However, there\'s probably another reason as to why the characters are behaving in such a way. The episode as a whole feels like it\'s attempting to be a dark comedy, yet its only outlet for humor is to be as loud as humanly possible and random- as for the dark part of it... well it fails that too. The episodes idea of ""Dark Humor"" borders on being childish, and nothing more.If you manage to get past that dumpster fire, at the very least you\'re treated with a better, yet still mediocre, 2nd episode titled ""The Story of the Mysterious Tunnel"".The episodes title pretty much sums up the plot going forward, it\'s a very basic concept that has potential yet is squandered quite a bit. There is something I neglected to mention for the prior episode that\'s also an issue here; This show has an awful habit of over-explaining everything. We tend to get a visual representation of X happening, only for a character to dissipate any sense of mystery by going ""OH X IS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THIS AND THAT"" or something to a similar effect- why they felt it necessary to treat the audience as if they had the IQ of a rock is beyond me, but beyond it ruining the atmosphere it also merely wastes precious screen time.Moving on from that, the shows poor visual presentation really rears its ugly head in this episode in particular. I don\'t expect every frame to replicate the meticulous detail that can be found on some panels in Junji Ito\'s works, but the fact that they don\'t bother even for key scenes is mind boggling- especially considering that at the very least the ""Junji Ito Collection"" attempted this every now and then. The low level of detail in scenes that\'re supposed to shock the viewer kills any potential to be horrifying; It fails to create any contrast between those scenes and the scenes in which nothing unordinary happens. It\'s dull and unimpactful. Oh yeah, and the CGI vehicle had me giggling to myself.Aside from that, there\'s not much more to comment on when it comes to this episode. It\'s a very by the books camp-fire story that could be effective, but ultimately ends up being mid.The second episode is also paired with another story, ""Ice cream Truck"".I uh... I don\'t have anything to say about this at all. I\'m pretty sure my eyes were open and were looking at the TV whilst this portion was playing, but I don\'t remember anything about it at all, save for the fact that the Ice cream truck man looks like he\'s in the wrong anime. Says a lot about the episode itself I suppose...Considering all of this, maybe it\'s fair to say that this show is a ""mixed bag"", but that\'d honestly would be giving it too much credit. Compared to other great horror titles, such as ""Higurashi: no Naku Koro ni"", this show clearly isn\'t consistent in anything that it attempts to do. With the stories being as simple and self-contained as they are, the show needed something else to carry it forward, and that should\'ve been in the presentation of said stories, whether it be the visuals, the sound design, or the intrigue, yet it fails to do any of that even at an average level.The only rightly good thing I can say about this show is that it got me to dust off my MAL account that\'s been inactive for years now just to write all of this and warn people not to watch it.If you\'re new to anime and are thirsting for some actually good Horror themed anime\'s, here\'s some you can watch instead of this:""Higurashi: no Naku Koro ni"", ""Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei"", ""Elfen Lied"", ""Another"".Now excuse me whilst I unironically watch ""Ghost Stories (Dubbed)"". supposed colourful cast of characters, of whom do have very distinguishable personalities from one another- but let\'s not get this misconstrued with the cast actually being ""good"".

And I'm glad I watched it.Creepy, twisted and dark works of one and only Junji Ito are well knows around the world and remembering last attempt to adapt his work being worried was more than justified. Not to mention few last Studio Deen works weren't the best.But here we are, we got 20 short stories from Ito's rich and vile world, some were great, some quite disappointing, unfortunately what works on paper not always works on the silver screen. Regardless that - it was fun yet...twisted watch. Definitely the best two shorts were Hanging Baloons and Tomie, as expected, two of the most renowned and known of his works. We all known that Junji Ito's works are blend of deeply unsettling psychological horror and body horror, sometimes taken to the genres extreme. But always having one thing in common - profound impact on the reader, wether it's just a creepy short like The Story of the Mysterious Tunnel or a bit more complex The Thing that Drifted Ashore, also both adaptations of these stories were quite on par with original.But moving onto Studio Deen, I'm always saying that, didn't have greatest streak lately, yeah, but I'd like to remind everyone that they are, after all, creators of em few horror animes that are worth watching after years, namely - Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (need to add that while it's at best average adaptation, it stands on its own as a standalone work) and dark and deeply moving Jigoku Shoujo. Yes, I'm not a fan of anime horrors, unlike in live-action, these tend to be quite disappointing, let me just mention Another of the head, which can't decide whether it wants to be a full on horror, or another teen fucking drama. And that goes for most of the anime horrors in recent years, no need to mention that horrible adaptation of Corpse Party, isn't it. But here we are, this time simplicity in animation actually works miracles in this show, while Junji Ito's works are full of detail, in its core are quite simple. And it works in favour of the adaptation. Fluidity and backgrounds are quite on par with it, the main con I would have is of use CGI, sometimes overusing 3D models on 2D backgrounds hurt my eyes, but in general it's more than acceptable, this time Deen had enough time to finish the work.Sound design and voice acting are among the best in recent years, beautifully crafted soundtrack only makes entire show more unsettling.Dark ambient mixed with smooth electronics and proper orchestration here and there gives proper chills even listening outside of the show. Voice acting on the other hand is a powerhouse. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Sound design in general was bloody spot on, amazingly atmospheric yet eerie. Couldn't ask for more in that departement, definitely one of the better sounding shows in recent months. I'm not a fan of the opening theme though, but ending theme on the other hand is one of my Winter 2023 favourites.For better or worse it's a quite successful adaptation of Junji Ito's works, brings them no shame, to be honest looking at the picked works it is actually quite great entry into his works. It isn't particularly scary, but it's really creepy and unsettling, especially in these stronger episodes. Releasing it all at once isn't the greatest idea since consuming it all in one go can be quite hard, not only because of themes but as well as psychological exhaustion.Summing it up it's quite good show, respecting its source material and amazing audio. Animation wise it ain't the best, especially when mixing too much of CGI with more grounded 2D animations but nothing, that would kill the atmosphere. Bacgrounds are spot on, character designs stay true to the source and overall manages to keep up with the creepiness of the original work. Best enjoyed alone in darkness, ain't work to enjoy with friends and definitely not your regular entertaining shows. Being a seinen I believe should be watched by more mature audience and definitely audience that understands this type of work.I am satisfied, could be better but it's good enough to pass the mark.6,5/10 twisted watch.

As a fan of Junji Ito and his works, I expected a lot of adaptations like Tomie, the Hanging Balloons, and many others and I must say that I have mixed feelings, Studio Deen is not my favorite studio but I must admit that this time it did surprise me, the Anime to...a certain extent I liked how it was directed (some stories) and the animation was better than I expected, the only thing that could be criticized here could be the CGI combined with 2d poorly implemented but even so I was comfortable with that side.

Leaving aside the technical aspects, I do not feel that the work has managed to transmit in the same way what Juni Ito transmits in the Manga, I mean obviously it will not be the same because of the medium in which it is transmitted but in this case I feel that the only story in which I was able to feel a true adaptation were in Tomie and in the hanging balloons, the others lacked time and dedication, since I feel that their poor execution meant that the message was not transmitted well and that is why many people are not satisfied I don't feel like it's the worst adaptation, but it could have been better, although coming from Studio Deen it doesn't surprise me much.3. Now, at this final point I will answer the question of whether I would recommend it or not, if you are a fan of Juni Ito's works and you decide to see this, you will surely not be very happy due to certain errors already mentioned and that did not manage to capture what that the author wanted to show the audience, and partly they had a lot of time to do it and I feel very sorry for Juni Ito and his fans but at this point it cannot be changed.Now if you don't know anything about Juni Ito this would be a perfect entry to his works and if you like it then you can go and read his works, which are much better than the adaptation itself, and you can really feel the terror of Junji Ito.To finish, I feel that more could have been dedicated to the adaptation and to improve certain technical and directing aspects of the work, but if you are someone who does not know anything about the world of Junji Ito, you may have liked it and if you want to enjoy more, you can stop by to read, and this adaptation would be a good bridge, now if you are a reader of the manga then the opinions about the adaptation depend on your tastes.Rate: 7/10 a certain extent I liked how it was directed (some stories) and the animation was better than I expected, the only thing that could be criticized here could be the CGI combined with 2d poorly implemented but even so I was comfortable with that side.

If this is the calibre of his work then I REALLY don\'t know where that\'s coming from.The short horror stories range from the outright weird like an invasion of giant balloon heads that want to hang people to the utterly mundane, by which I mean 10 minutes straight of ""this guys brother is irritating"" with absolutely zero plot nor payoff.The writing is inconsistent. In one episode the explanation for the event would be summarised by a shrug, because there was no rhyme...nor reason to them, and the next you\'ll have a character halt the story for some painfully stilted exposition to explain everything they\'ve ever done and how that relates to, at best, a mildly creepy plot.The only way most of this even qualifies as horror is if you\'d faint in terror because someone said the word ""ghost"" or vomit at something most would look at and go ""oh, that\'s a bit gross."" There\'s such little atmosphere, so little build up or tension, and even less payoff nine times out of ten. nor reason to them, and the next you\'ll have a character halt the story for some painfully stilted exposition to explain everything they\'ve ever done and how that relates to, at best, a mildly creepy plot.The only way most of this even qualifies as horror is if you\'d faint in terror because someone said the word ""ghost"" or vomit at something most would look at and go ""oh, that\'s a bit gross.""

As far as I am concerned, the only Junji Ito manga that was adapetd reasonably well is Gyo, which was heavily changed from it's source material.

The same exact score as for the 2018 ""Collection"" unfortunately.Horror is quite a peculiar genre, requiring a lot more suspension of disbelief than others and is usually much more effective the more it leaves to the imagination. Which is why it tends to work much better in prose, or graphic novels, where your mind has to fill in a lot more between each sentence or panel with your own personal terrors. This is true for all the greatest horror writers like Poe, Lovecraft, or...Stephen King, with very rare exceptional adaptations actually doing justice to the original work. In the case of Lovecraft, i\'m still waiting for a good one, despite all the attempts.When the suspension of disbelief is stretched too far, horror quickly turns into into its opposite - comedy. And the line between these two genres is surprisingly thin. Often fused to great effect in many movies - Peter Jackson\'s early filmography being a prime example in my mind. But here the laughable moments are not intentional and just constantly break any possibility of imersion and enjoyment. The minute you find yourself slowly slipping inside the unfolding world being portrayed, some utterly non-sense scene, or some ridiculously absurd dialogue, just pops up to brutally remind you this is all fake.Junji Ito is a master of atmosphere, but doesn\'t really know how to end a story most of the time and he tends to lobotomize his characters of most of their common-sense... This certainly doesn\'t help the job at hand, but is completely forgivable in the manga format, where the ambience and pacing superbly make up for it. On screen they become hugely exacerbated to a point where i almost suspect the studio was deliberately trying to highlight these flaws. I refuse to believe Junji Ito is impossible to adapt and i rather think the story-boarding work for this anime was rather lazy - basically adding frames between the manga\'s panels, beat by beat, without any artful attempt at an actual proper re-telling.This is the third peculiarity of horror adaptations: different media require different approaches and the more faithful you try to be to the written word, the less effective you will generally be in a visual format. This becomes a specially huge problem in this genre, where you are much more likely make to a good horror movie, the more you stray from the original work (and the more you risk alienating fans) - a fact that is masterfully evident in The Shinning. But you wouldn\'t need to go to that far to make a better adaptation, had the story-telling not been absolutely flat and linear, had there been more creative applications of rhythm to the scenes, paired with better sound design, better animation, better camera work, better almost everything......

Nothing of substance is added here, the shot composition is dreadful, every corner is cut as far as animation goes. The art itself is just uninspired and poorly detailed.

I was initially disappointed in the first few episodes of this adaptation, where I was not necessarily feeling scared or creeped out, but rather just laughing and cringing at the scenes.I think if you are still a fan of Ito Junji's work you should give this adaptation a try as the later episodes encompass the original manga's vibe much better.Overall while not perfect I do not think this is as...bad as what most people make it out to be. bad as what most people make it out to be."", ""Atrocious adaptation yet again, two episodes are enough to turn anyone away. One of the worst things about Junji Ito's bad stories is how they abruptly end leaving no explanation to what happened, or them starting extremely slow and then rushing to the end in the last few pages. If you think this is intentional, it's not. Ito himself said in a interview he's a lazy ass and instead of rewriting the script to fit the 40-60 pages he prefers to change it on the go. This sometimes work, most of the time doesn't. This anime manages to do even worse somehow. Sometimes they end...the story even before it reaches its natural conclusion. It's nuts. It's like they never worked on media before. Directing is bad, editing is tolerable at best, character design is extremely oversemplified and the animation feels like you're watching paper cuts move.

I didn't keep up with 'The Junji Ito Collection' beyond the first couple of episodes because of this, but the team behind it has now released 'Junji Ito: Maniac' on Netflix, and it's the exact same shitshow as its' predecessor.I get that trying to translate Ito's illustrations into something animated is a Herculean task - which is probably why Hiroshi Nagahama's 'Uzumaki' adaptation has been delayed like 12 times. And considering this team came back for more, I believe they also love Ito's...work and want to do their best . . . but the problem is that their best looks like absolute dogshit.The major sin here isn't a fundamentally misguided approach to the material - there are moments and stories in here that do manage to work. But there are also a lot of minor transgressions that pile on each other and sap all the colour out of these stories. And speaking of colour, that's one of my big peeves with 'Maniac'. It just can't seem to get the hues right. Most of it is dull. Some of it is downright ugly. Other parts swing in the opposite direction and look garishly oversaturated. And some scenes are dark to the point of being completely illegible (though we can blame Netflix's stream compression for some of that). It's just not nice to look at, and rarely in the intended way.There's also a shocking amount of inconsistency across these episodes. In a stronger show, that might count as variety, but it feels like nobody had any idea what the overall direction should be here. Why are some stories in 4:3 aspect? Why's one episode letterboxed? Why's a single half-episode in black and white? I couldn't begin to guess the motivation behind any of it. The only consistent aspect across the series is that it's just not very good at anything it's doing. It's almost impressive that this show managed to take one of the most iconic and recognisable art styles in manga and adapt it into something this fucking DULL.And I mean: I get it. Ito's philosophy is that the more detailed and intricate a drawing is, the creepier it is. And he's right! But you can only really animate something that complicated if you have an infinite amount of time or an immortal league of cartoonists at your beck and call. You need to get creative to compensate, which is not something 'Maniac' is very good at.But even outside of being an adaptation, 'Maniac' is terrible because it doesn't have nearly the grasp of tone and atmosphere necessary to make a good horror story. There are episodes of Goosebumps and Are You Afraid of the Dark? with better examples of horror fundamentals than this show's best entries.If this show couldn't be good, I wish it could have at least been bad in an interesting or memorable way. GYO might be terrible, but you can have a fun time laughing at it with friends. 'Maniac' is too dreary and lifeless to inspire even ironic entertainment.The most flattering thing I could say about 'Maniac' is that it furthers the accessibility of Ito's stories, I guess. But then again, if there's one mangaka who isn't hurting for exposure, it's probably Junji Ito - and he deserves better. He's a tough nut to adapt, but there are creatives up to the challenge.

That is just the case for some of these stories that were adapted. However, a lot of them end in a good place and follow the source material well despite the time they had. His work always attempts to be profound in its conclusion, whether it is complex or just creepy and terrifying.I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy some of these stories. I liked the more goofy stories like 'The Hanging Balloons' and the 'Ice Cream Bus' because I just got a good laugh out of how silly they were. I also thought some of the horror aspects of stories like 'Layers of Fear' and 'The Whispering Woman' were well thought out and compelling. The animation and music are nothing to write home about, but I don't think they take away from anything either.If you are curious about Junji Ito's work or are a fan of horror, then maybe you can give this a shot. You will probably find at least one story enjoyable, or you will at least get a good idea of what his work is like.I ranked the stories from best to worst below:Layers of FearWhispering WomanThe Long Hair in the AtticBack AlleyTomb TownThe Hanging BalloonsLibrary of IllusionsIce Cream BusTomieThe Story of the Mysterious TunnelThe BullyThe Thing That Drifted AshoreIntruderHeadless SculpturesWhere the Sandman LivesThe Bizarre Hikizuri SiblingsSouichi's Beloved PetUnendurable LabyrinthMoldThe Room of Four Heavy Walls"", ""(Coming from a Junji Ito fan)So far i have only watched a few episodes. I know the majority of the people here who have read Ito's work will tell you to read the manga, which I agree with. The way Junji Ito structures his work has a lot to do with the buildup. His artstyle also plays into his unique storytelling and I do not think this anime does him justice. I was hoping for an anime similar to Yami shibai, because then they could implement his iconic artstyle, but the anime is bringing the same disappointments as Junji Ito collection. I do hope the...show will later on raise my expectations and maybe bring back the feeling I have when reading Junji Ito.I can see this anime being enjoyable if you have not read his work, but if you have read his manga and enjoy it, you will most likely not like this anime show will later on raise my expectations and maybe bring back the feeling I have when reading Junji Ito.I can see this anime being enjoyable if you have not read his work, but if you have read his manga and enjoy it, you will most likely not like this anime"", 'First and foremost save yourself the pain and skip the first story. Nothing happens and it’s all just loud screaming that can only be summed up as essentially 20min of Zenitsu and Asta with no breaks.The manga is definitely far better and the anime skips some of the better ones.Personally I was exited to see ‘whispering woman’ but the animation, by skipping certain shots, misses the creepy feeling and anticipation or twist that the manga brings. The art style however definitely compliments the weird feeling of the stories.Disappointed and not something I’d rewatch, but overall not something I’m unhappy about watching at least once. ', 'Junji Ito\'s manga can\'t be animated well!Of course, the genre of horror in the medium of anime has always had a hard time. It\'s hard to trigger horror in the consumer with drawn pictures and animations. Horror in anime very quickly looks like trash. That\'s why you should focus on atmosphere and shock the consumer. And that\'s exactly what Junji Ito\'s manga do perfectly. And that\'s exactly what the anime fails at.Junji Ito is a masterful horror mangaka and arguably the best in the industry. He is well aware of the weaknesses of the manga medium when it comes to horror, yet he executes the...genre perfectly. In each story he builds an oppressive atmosphere and manages to shock the reader at just the right moment. For this Junji Ito uses very detailed images. He draws on individual panels sometimes for hours. He also uses a simple and well-known trick of the manga industry. He puts the shocking pictures at the beginning of the double page. So this image jumps in your face when you turn the page, because when you read a manga, you always see the other images already in the corner of your eye. Only when you turn a page, you don\'t know what\'s coming. And it is exactly this effect that Junji Ito makes use of. Furthermore, Junji Ito addresses certain phobias in most short stories, including, for example, trypophobia (the fear of irregularly arranged holes), claustrophobia (the fear of confined spaces) or hypnophobia (the fear of falling asleep). He wraps these up in mostly crazy and loopy stories. Junji Ito\'s manga works are simply great.The anime is unfortunately just a poor adaptation of the whole thing. It lacks everything that makes the manga so good. The most obvious are the simply drawn pictures and the mediocre animation. Unlike the manga, the anime can\'t boast of rich detail. As a result, the shockers are absent. No images that cause discomfort or nausea, no images that shock with an exaggerated depiction of violence, and no images that trigger phobias. On top of that, a quickly produced animation. When watching the anime, pay attention to the eyes. Often the iris and pupil are unintentionally missing and only the white sclera of the eyes can be seen. The anime just barely manages to create an oppressive atmosphere, but you probably can\'t call it horror. Of course, the stories are taken from the manga. But these are just so poorly implemented that I kept asking myself how good these images must look in the manga.On a positive note, I want to mention the music, especially the opening and ending. The opening ""Paranoid"" by MADKID is super fitting to the anime. The rocking screaming and the visuals reflect the weirdness of Junji Ito\'s stories. The ending, on the other hand, is more relaxed and I really like it as a standalone song.Now follows a brief commentary on each short story of the anime. There might be some slight spoilers:""The Strange Hikizuri Siblings"" - Ends somewhere in the middle and horror is left out""The Story of the Mysterious Tunnel"" - Atmosphere was poorly built up""Ice Cream Bus"" - prime example of ""must be gross in manga"" and CGI was distracting""Hanging Balloon"" - a good adaptation""Four x Four walls"" - zero atmosphere. Where\'s the horror? I don\'t want a slice of life.""The Sandman\'s Lair"" - Here we have our hypnophobia, but fear of sleep doesn\'t come up.""Intruder"" - epitome of saying nothing.""Long Hair in the Attic"" - Super story, but does not dare to show shocking violence. The images lack detail.""Mold"" - Triggers zero nausea. The pictures are too flatly drawn for a black and white format.""Libary Vision"" - Beautiful story of a man slowly going insane. But the fact that the woman doesn\'t act and just watches is super unbelievable. (Her synchro is not good either. But that\'s by the way.)""Tomb Town"" - Why doesn\'t the corpse in the trunk stink. But nice world Junji Ito creates there. The images lack depth again.""Layers of Terror"" - Again, the images lack detail. The story is nice and crazy. But you should reach for the manga here as well.""The Thing that Drifted Ashore"" - CGI, CGI, CGI.""Tomie・Photo"" - I love the Tomie stories. I love the mystery around her and the charisma of Tomie. I didn\'t get either of those. Also, the depiction of violence is again too lax.""The Unendurable Labyrinth"" - Poor build up of atmosphere. You can guess the rest, right?""The Bully"" - one of the better implementations.""Alley"" - quite cool, not special""The Headless Sculptures"" - Must repeat myself: bad pictures, nice crazy story""Whispering Woman"" - The whispering woman was depicted creepy. Enjoyed it.""Soichi\'s Beloved Pet"" - I guess the worst comes at the endIf you don\'t know the manga, you can probably have fun with the anime. If you liked Junji Ito Maniac, you have to check out the manga, and if you didn\'t, then also. There are 2-3 good adaptations here, but all the stories lack the visuals. That\'s just what makes Junji Ito. You\'re disgusted and don\'t want to read any further, and yet the next night you\'re sitting down to the next story. Junji Ito stands and falls on the images, if you do not get that right, no anime will ever adapt Junji Ito well. I hope the Uzumaki anime gets that right. The trailers looked promising. Apparently they recognized the problems and tried to adapt the manga style. Still, I stand by my initial thesis: ""Junji Ito\'s manga can\'t be animated well!"" At the same time, I don\'t necessarily mean to say that it can\'t be done. It will probably just never happen, unfortunately. A good Junji Ito anime needs two things: time and money. I can\'t imagine that any producer would put so much money into a niche project like Junji Ito and give the studios enough time than something clever would come out of it. Please let me be wrong. The future will tell.Thanks for reading genre perfectly. In each story he builds an oppressive atmosphere and manages to shock the reader at just the right moment.

I am only focusing on the story and not how it was adapted (I\'m not so stuck up with production houses and animation style unless it is downright awful to look at)2. Loved a few stories, disliked a few storiesI\'ll follow this format: Each story synopsis with my ratingEp1 -The Strange Hikizuri Siblings (2/5)A family of siblings who has lost their parents are squabbling away with each other and their encounter with a photographer who\'s interested in the supernatural.Didn\'t really enjoy it much...Ep2 -The Story of the Mysterious Tunnel (3.5/5)A tunnel that people once enter keep returning to and end up disappearing.I really liked the premise and the eeriness of the whole storyIce Cream Bus (4/5)A father-son duo in a new neighborhood comes across an ice cream bus that takes the kids on a tour every week while giving a treat of mountains of ice creamSounds picture perfect, but in reality, it isn\'t. I read the Ice Cream Bus earlier and really loved watching it on screenEp3 -Hanging Balloon (5/5)A popular idol commits suicide followed by mysterious deaths all over the town.Absolutely loved this episode. I was on edge the entire time! One of my favorite episodes.Ep4 -Four x Four Walls (3.5/5)In one of the Soichi mini-stories where the brother, fed up with Soichi\'s pranks, wants to study in peaceLiked this episode but looking at the room I myself felt suffocatedThe Sandman\'s Lair (4/5)Tormented by his dreams, Yuji asks his friend to keep him awake so that the ""thing"" doesn\'t awaken.Amazing story and I love open-ended premisesEp5 -Intruder (3/5)Oshikiri lives alone in a huge mansion and hears someone\'s footsteps. Meeting up with his friends they try to find the reason for it and they end up finding things better left unknown during their investigations.Although I did enjoy it, the story felt rushed and as I haven\'t read the Oshikiri series, I had zero context. Therefore, Intruder as a standalone felt off.Long Hair in the Attic (4/5)A girl with exceptionally long and beautiful hair is dumped by a guy after being together for years. This is followed by a lot of horrifying events with respect to her hair.Although the reason is known for the events, and how they are connected... I loved this oneEp6 -Mold (4.5/5)Akasaka returns to his new apartment after renting to his former teacher for a year. But the house is a mess.Loved this! It was sinister, disgusting, and extremely eerie.Library Vision (5/5)Goro is obsessed with the books in his library. He keeps reading and re-reading them until he knows the books word for word. He\'s afraid that the books will run away from him.I absolutely loved this one. I could see myself in this one if I ever lost my sanity (Just kidding). The ending of the story was somewhat predictable but didn\'t reduce the enjoyment. Another favorite episode.Ep7 -Tomb Town (4.5/5)The siblings drive through the mountains to visit their childhood friend. An accident on the way and they end up in a town full of tombstones.Another exceptional episode. During the entire episode, I was on edge and worried about what might happen.Ep8 -Layers of Terror (5/5)I don\'t think I can write a synopsis for this without giving out spoilers. During an excavation project, a man finds a child\'s skull buried under layers of soil. Years later, his daughters had something tragic happen to them. His wife\'s obsession with the younger daughter.Fantastic episode. Another favoriteThe Thing that Drifted Ashore (2/5)A sea creature is found at the beach. Cutting it up led to a devastating find.Didn\'t really like it as much.Ep9 -Tomie Photo (3.5/5)One of the mini-stories from Tomie, where Tsukiko takes pictures to sell around the school. She discovers something unpleasant when she shoots Tomie\'s pictures.I read Tomie earlier, and the anime did a good job of capturing the creepiness.Ep10 -Unendurable Labyrinth (4/5)Two girls find themselves lost in the mountain and end up spending the night at the Tantrik Buddhist temple where they discover a lot of disturbing things.Great story, but no closure. It was extremely terrifying and creepy but I did not get any answers.The Bully (5/5)Kuriko is asked to take care of Naoya while his mother is at work, but she keeps bullying her every single day. They meet again as grown-ups, and things aren\'t as they seem.Another favorite episode. The scenes with bullying were difficult to watch, and the ending, although expected, was extremely satisfying.Ep11 -Alley (5/5)A young man boards a room but discovers something he shouldn\'t have about the alley adjacent to it.Another favorite of this series. Karma at its finest.Headless Statue (4/5)The art teacher creates headless sculptures for his exhibition. Things take an unexpected turn.Although I loved this episode, I found the characters extremely annoying.Ep12 -Whispering WomanA woman becomes the caretaker of a young girl who is mentally unstable and questions everything.Fabulous episode. Another favoriteSoichi\'s Beloved Pet (2/5)The kids find a cat and take it in, but Soichi has other plans.I realize that I don\'t really enjoy Soichi\'s stories.I know it\'s pretty long, but thank you if you read this.

He is an amazing artist and that is always where the strength of his manga came from. His ability to understand his readers and create horrific scenarios that pique our morbid curiosity is what makes his manga so special, not his characters or dialogue. He frequently reuses characters and names, which is fine, because the characters are often just blank slates for the reader to project themself on to. In manga unlike anime, the reader has the control, the reader must choose to flip the page and brave what is on the other...side. This does not translate well into television and I think that is where a large part of the dissatisfaction comes from in this series. Not to mention the frankly boring depictions of what are supposed to be horrific reveals. Even in Junjis more phycological horror stories there is still always a visual element of unsettling facial expressions or detail that the series just kinda jumps right over. The horrible cgi ruins entire stories such as the hanging balloons where the scariest part is having to look at the cgi ruin one of Junji's most famous stories. Even the animation in the non-cgi heavy episodes is abysmal. In Tomb town there are multiple shots of the back of characters heads just so they dont have to animate characters talking. The final reveal shot in unendurable labyrinth actually has less details in the mummies faces than when the character originally enter the labyrinth. The series also makes the bold claim that they animated Tomie after adapting one story not even apart of the original collection. That didnt stop them from slapping her all over the intro tho. (I know alot of people hated it but I actually kinda liked the intro, bit of a bop)All that said, I'll still give it a 7/10. Yeah there are a lot of problems and they choose some stories that would just never have adapted well to animation in my opinion. But I liked it. More than anything I love seeing Junjis stories retold and shared on a huge platform like netflix. It makes me happy just to watch. I liked starting a new episode and seeing which stories they choose to adapt. Is this series particularly good, no, but ask yourself what you truly wanted from this series. In my opinion they could have fix the animation issues and it would have been just as bad because most of Junji's stories just do not translate well to animation. And once again Junji is an awful writer, no one wants to sit there and listen to dialogue he wrote, its not good. Netflix adapted his stories just as he wrote them and that is the problem. Not the animation, though it definitely doesnt help. Im giving this a 7/10 because it is a perfect animation of his manga. If you want to have a Junji anime that is actually good, its not going to come from being faithful to his manga. I think people hate this series so much because it doesnt capture the same spark they felt when they read his stories originally. But honestly I cant even feel the same spark I felt originally rereading his stories, knowing whats going to happen diffuses tension and thats ok.If you are a fan of Itou Junji, check it out, its cool to see his stories voice acted and with sound design. Shout out specifically Long hair in the attic which had me actually recoiling with the sounds of teeth grinding. And hear me out on this, just try to enjoy it. Dont take it seriously, think of it as reliving the stories you have already read, because thats all it is. side.

It really left...you with a sense of inescapable horror. The only episode I wasn't a fan of was the last episode Soichi's beloved pet. It was definitely more mundane a story compared to the others and without giving to much away I feel it was a low point in the series.I wish they would have ended it with the bully or the unendurable labyrinth as those cary the essence of the show alot better than Soichi's beloved pet. All that being said I would definitely recommend this to any fan of horror. It isn't perfect but if I had to rate it 1-10 I would definitely give it an 8.Also can we talk about the fact that the theme song had no business being so FIRE! 🔥 you with a sense of inescapable horror.

The 2d animation was aswell! The only critique I would have about it is...the 3d animation, it doesn't seem to be the animators main skill and it didn't look the best but it wasn't used too often so I can put that aside.Last critique I'll give it, is the story pacing, although it mostly does the originals justice, it isn't the best with the pacing and seems a bit fast pace compared to the originals to me.

So in steps Junji...Ito Maniac, a compilation of stories from well known mangka Junji Ito (I know shocker) now I can’t comment on the manga as I haven’t read it, so I can’t comment on how good an adaption or how well it adopts his artstyle, which even I know is legendary when it comes to horror.There lies the show's greatest weakness in my humble opinion, whilst it’s nowhere near as bad as typical horror anime have it, it’s still not perfect, in some parts looks rushed and others looks lazy, the mouths for example don’t always match the words being said. Other parts look lazy, or well, lacking detail, like it doesn’t look horrible, just lacking details.However where this shines is with basically everything else, the use of light and dark is good, excellent even, in creating suspense, the sound design also helps this, it’s got me creeped out which is what I want from horror like this is really good stuff, this is creepy, horrifying and just all in all what I want from something that says HORROR this does it all so well, which is brilliant, I love the fact that it’s making me uncomfortable, I love the fact it’s creeping me out, if I watch horror that’s what I Want, so THANK YOU.One thing of note is there’s some that are decidedly less horror than others, the balloon story, FLIPPING TERRIFYING, like that was horrific, I was sitting here just like…….like……….like……….WORDS ARE HARD, it was so good and terrifying, however others are much less scary, the study one, with the room in a room in a room in a room in a room (I think I got that right xD) whilst annoying, and I’d absolutely hate life if I had to deal with someone like Soichi, it’s not scary perse, just annoying, it was honestly annoying to watch as well.The point of some being much scarier is a trouble the series has, the tone shifts are violent at times, from one story about a creepy tunnel, a classic in Japanese horror, to another about an ice cream van, the tunnel story, ‘The Story of the Mysterious Tunnel’ was horrific, most the way through, starting off on a light bead, it got horrific, to the ice cream story, ‘Ice Cream Bus’ which starts off in such a strange way, and it’s so much lighter than everything else, whilst it ended up pretty horrific, the start led to such a juxtaposition it just gave a shocking case of whiplash. Just swapping these two would’ve been much better with less whiplash, this I understand is an off product of having 20 stories to tell in only 12 episodes, but it’s something where it could be a bit better even by swapping orders and moving stuff around, there’s no real overarching story barring a couple mentions of something else in others.Something I’d like to note is the show’s use of colours, beyond light and dark, the entire show’s colour pallet is washed out, which is obviously by design, this in part is to alleviate regular anime’s trouble with making horror shows, as the colour pallet is a big reason why it struggles, but this, in my opinion also adds an extra layer of the horror factor, by keeping things dull it doesn’t give you a break in tone, then when it wants something to stand out it can brighten it up, and it really adds to the design of the show.I also really do love a washed out colour pallet, one of my favourite shows for art design is Mars Red which does a similar thing in keeping things dulled down, so do note this point could very well be a point of preference, but I do think here especially it adds to the show quite a bit.The sound in this is at points, almost too good for its own good, now I know that may sound odd, like how can something be too good, well this may just be a me thing once more, but in the story ‘Long Hair in the Attic’ there’s a section where the main girl in it, who sadly died (not overly surprising in a horror show tho, let’s be honest) was grinding her teeth, and well, this sound was honestly the absolute worst thing ever, it entered my spinal cords I stg, it was not a nice noise, which honestly, props to the sound people for pulling it off, as much as I hated it, it was brilliant, tho I still hated it xD whilst the balloon story was just the absolute most horrific, for just noise, that’s with the worst, like jeezus.I will add, this show doesn’t try to break the stereotype of anime just not being able to animate cars, the cares in this are absolutely woeful, they just are 3D things plopped in a 2D world they stick out like a sore thumb in every scene they’re in and don’t look any good at all honestly, I know cars aren’t the easiest thing to animate, but how do anime in 2023 still have trouble with this?CGI is something this show can’t do at all, which is sad because the general poor animation is something I can overlook, it’s something that doesn’t take me completely out of the show, but when the CGI comes on, it’s rough, it’s really rough, the problem being, unsurprisingly, 3D on a 2D background, I do have hope for CGI in anime in the future and I do honestly think it’s the next step for the medium, but it needs to be done properly, which it sadly isn’t here.To rank the stories we were told, best to worst, all in my opinion of courseHanging BalloonTomie .

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out!', ""DNA^2 is... well, its good. Simple as that. If I had to say one thing about it from the get go, it would have to be that the art style and animation are it's strongpoints. If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that?

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that).

There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch.

That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds.

Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended.

So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should. It\'s bad, it\'s silly, it\'s the laughingstock of the anime world but you should give it a whirl just for kicks with your mates over drinks. my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier. To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through. The only thing that will ruin the show is having high expectations so lower your standards rofl. Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person. a harem.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people.', ""The story is cool but full of inconsistencies and holes. That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

Simple as that. If I had to say one thing about it from the get go, it would have to be that the art style and animation are it's strongpoints. If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

Same for sound.', 'n the new episode of ""A Blast from the Past"" we have DNA² which is an anime...And the fact that i have to state it is because most people after watching even a sample vid from this turn into chinese psychopaths and sacrifice their daughters to the gods of Olympus to find salvation. And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis.

There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch.

That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

Same for sound.', 'n the new episode of ""A Blast from the Past"" we have DNA² which is an anime...And the fact that i have to state it is because most people after watching even a sample vid from this turn into chinese psychopaths and sacrifice their daughters to the gods of Olympus to find salvation. And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should. It\'s bad, it\'s silly, it\'s the laughingstock of the anime world but you should give it a whirl just for kicks with your mates over drinks. my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier. To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through. The only thing that will ruin the show is having high expectations so lower your standards rofl. Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person. a harem.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless.', 'So im going to give this my honest review, cause i think people for some reason were expecting too much from a show where its synopsis is trying to stop a playboy. Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people.', ""The story is cool but full of inconsistencies and holes. That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier. To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through. The only thing that will ruin the show is having high expectations so lower your standards rofl. Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person. a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people.', ""The story is cool but full of inconsistencies and holes. That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out."", ""DNA^2,Story:The story is a bit odd, but is pretty good and is like any harem anime, silly but good enough. This anime lacks a lot and I have to say it really does shame the manga. This anime is very rushed and most plotlines are skipped, however it does have it's moments and the anime can be just one big joke. It's funny from time to time, also wierd, but it's not to bad.Art:For when this was made the art is definitely top notch.Sound:Soundtrack is good nothing special. Japanese voices...are good but english dub sucks.Character:Character's are good, main character is the highlight of the show and really makes it what it is. Some characters just make me want to laugh, not in a good way.Why did I like this anime?I'm torn on this anime, they completely messed up the anime and rushed it so fast it turned out to be borderline bad. I don't know if the production crew didn't have enough funding, or if they blew it all on the animation from Madhouse studios, but it puts the manga to shame. However it is kinda good due to the characters, they are the reason this anime is arguably good. are good but english dub sucks.Character:Character's are good, main character is the highlight of the show and really makes it what it is.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

Same for sound.', 'n the new episode of ""A Blast from the Past"" we have DNA² which is an anime...And the fact that i have to state it is because most people after watching even a sample vid from this turn into chinese psychopaths and sacrifice their daughters to the gods of Olympus to find salvation. And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should. It\'s bad, it\'s silly, it\'s the laughingstock of the anime world but you should give it a whirl just for kicks with your mates over drinks. my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier. To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch.

That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier. To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through. The only thing that will ruin the show is having high expectations so lower your standards rofl. Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person. a harem.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people.', ""The story is cool but full of inconsistencies and holes. That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we?

So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added.', 'Wow I never thought I would find an anime that I would give a 1/10. This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

Same for sound.', 'n the new episode of ""A Blast from the Past"" we have DNA² which is an anime...And the fact that i have to state it is because most people after watching even a sample vid from this turn into chinese psychopaths and sacrifice their daughters to the gods of Olympus to find salvation. And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should. It\'s bad, it\'s silly, it\'s the laughingstock of the anime world but you should give it a whirl just for kicks with your mates over drinks. my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence.

Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should. It\'s bad, it\'s silly, it\'s the laughingstock of the anime world but you should give it a whirl just for kicks with your mates over drinks.', ""I have seen too little reviews here, so I'll add my two cents about the anime.To be honest, what made me give this anime a try was its synopsis, I mean, an average guy with some allergy towards girls ends up being a mega playboy due to a bullet from the future and impregnates a lot of women, sounds not as cliche as the shows of today right? I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier. To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through. The only thing that will ruin the show is having high expectations so lower your standards rofl. Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person. a harem.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out!', ""DNA^2 is... well, its good. Simple as that. If I had to say one thing about it from the get go, it would have to be that the art style and animation are it's strongpoints. If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid.

Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended.

And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence.

As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler?

Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments.

Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that).

There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner).

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch.

That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid.

I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week.

Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended.

There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should. It\'s bad, it\'s silly, it\'s the laughingstock of the anime world but you should give it a whirl just for kicks with your mates over drinks. my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier. To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through. The only thing that will ruin the show is having high expectations so lower your standards rofl. Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person. a harem.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless.', 'So im going to give this my honest review, cause i think people for some reason were expecting too much from a show where its synopsis is trying to stop a playboy. Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people.', ""The story is cool but full of inconsistencies and holes. That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

Good luck.', 'I enjoyed the first 10 episodes and then it turned into a Dragon Ball Z feel to it that turned me off right then and there.  At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

Simple as that. If I had to say one thing about it from the get go, it would have to be that the art style and animation are it's strongpoints. If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that).

There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch.

That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

Same for sound.', 'n the new episode of ""A Blast from the Past"" we have DNA² which is an anime...And the fact that i have to state it is because most people after watching even a sample vid from this turn into chinese psychopaths and sacrifice their daughters to the gods of Olympus to find salvation. And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should. It\'s bad, it\'s silly, it\'s the laughingstock of the anime world but you should give it a whirl just for kicks with your mates over drinks. my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier. To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through. The only thing that will ruin the show is having high expectations so lower your standards rofl. Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person. a harem.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless.', 'So im going to give this my honest review, cause i think people for some reason were expecting too much from a show where its synopsis is trying to stop a playboy. Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people.', ""The story is cool but full of inconsistencies and holes. That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities.

To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through. The only thing that will ruin the show is having high expectations so lower your standards rofl. Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person. a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people.', ""The story is cool but full of inconsistencies and holes. That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out."", ""DNA^2,Story:The story is a bit odd, but is pretty good and is like any harem anime, silly but good enough. This anime lacks a lot and I have to say it really does shame the manga. This anime is very rushed and most plotlines are skipped, however it does have it's moments and the anime can be just one big joke. It's funny from time to time, also wierd, but it's not to bad.Art:For when this was made the art is definitely top notch.Sound:Soundtrack is good nothing special. Japanese voices...are good but english dub sucks.Character:Character's are good, main character is the highlight of the show and really makes it what it is. Some characters just make me want to laugh, not in a good way.Why did I like this anime?I'm torn on this anime, they completely messed up the anime and rushed it so fast it turned out to be borderline bad. I don't know if the production crew didn't have enough funding, or if they blew it all on the animation from Madhouse studios, but it puts the manga to shame. However it is kinda good due to the characters, they are the reason this anime is arguably good. are good but english dub sucks.Character:Character's are good, main character is the highlight of the show and really makes it what it is.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

Same for sound.', 'n the new episode of ""A Blast from the Past"" we have DNA² which is an anime...And the fact that i have to state it is because most people after watching even a sample vid from this turn into chinese psychopaths and sacrifice their daughters to the gods of Olympus to find salvation. And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should. It\'s bad, it\'s silly, it\'s the laughingstock of the anime world but you should give it a whirl just for kicks with your mates over drinks. my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier. To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through. The only thing that will ruin the show is having high expectations so lower your standards rofl. Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person. a harem.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.

At first it seemed great, different kind of story, funny and full of drama.  And then it did a complete 180 and kinda ruined it for me, the extra episodes (13 - 15) was more of the same DBZ style plot line. ', 'Time for another nostalgic review! Today we look at a 1994 harem anime with an intriguing plot, but really stupid execution. Unless you are an older fan born before 1993 or so, I will place a wager you haven\'t heard of this series. It has been almost completely forgotten, but honestly that isn\'t such a tragedy. This is DNA^2.The future is dangerously overpopulated, so scientists worked to find the mysterious cause of the population explosion that occurred in the late 20th century. It turns out it is largely the fault of 1 man-whore called the ""mega playboy"" who possesses genes so good that women...are hypnotized by him. This guy knocked up 100 women, who each gave birth to sons, who all went on to knock up 100 women of their own, and so on. A time cop is sent back to the past in order to shoot the ""mega playboy"" with a mutagen dart that will give him the DNA of a loser, so no women will want him. In the mind of the man who wrote this shitty series, women can instantly assess the DNA of any male with a quick glance and always make romantic decisions entirely based on eugenics. I\'m guessing that was his excuse that he wasn\'t getting any when he wrote this.The time cop finds the mega playboy, but discovers he is a complete loser and figures that she must have the wrong guy. However, she shoots him with the dart anyways and he ends up becoming the mega playboy as a result. The moment she went back in time to stop the mega playboy, she was guaranteed to create the mega playboy or else she wouldn\'t have had a reason to go back in the first place. This logic is based on Novikov\'s self consistency principle named after the theoretical astrophysicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. It states that you can\'t go back in time and change the reason you were going back in the first place. In fact, you may even be responsible for the event happening, like the Twilight Zone episode where a time traveler kills the real infant Adolf Hitler and replaces him with an orphan lookalike, who actually grows up to become the Hitler he went back in time to kill. The show later completely undermines this, but I never said it was well executed. I just said it had a few ideas that COULD have been interesting. The rest of the show revolves around the time cop chick trying desperately to cock block the mega playboy from scoring with various hot chicks.The character art is actually quite well done. The women looked pretty hot for 1994! At least if you were a geeky teenage male trying to fantasize about cartoon women. The animation is also fairly smooth for its time and the color pallet is very bright and jovial.Would I highly recommend this series? Not really. However, if you are an anime historian and want to see how harem anime have changed in the early 90s vs. the current age, I would in that case check this out! are hypnotized by him.

If you want to know more, then by all means read on.Story – To be honest, this is the reason I originally decided to watch this. It’s actually an interesting premise with the main character’s allergy to girls and his mega playboy alter ego threatening the future from overpopulation. The parts where his allergy is exploited are probably some of my favourites. Though, the whole mega-playboy thing is kind of...underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form. There are some fanservice bits here and there, but they are there to exploit Junta’s weakness towards girls. This means there will be no unnecessary fanservice you see in a lot of animes these days, just so people can get their jollies off or in hopes of boosting sales. As the story progresses it tends to rush a bit, which could have been solved if they extended the series to let’s say 14 episodes. Even 24 doesn’t sound like a bad idea, but I’m sure the budget had a lot to do with it (which happens a lot unfortunately, even today).  The first half of the series is a lot better in my opinion, with a heavier dose of laughs and better pacing. I couldn’t help but feel cheated with the rushed ending though. Not even the OVAs solved this, but that’s a whole different story. All in all, DNA2 does a fair enough job at keeping things interesting.Art/Animation – For a show that aired in ’94 it does a good job from an animation point of view. There’s still a fair amount of the typical shortcuts being used like single cel pans, repeat cycles and stills. The characters however, are fairly detailed and are even better than in the manga counterpart. I must say that I rather like Masakazu Katsura’s girl character designs a lot. Even now in ’09, the designs don’t seem all that outdated. Just goes to show you that Katsura has an appealing style that can withstand the test of time. On the background side of things, there’s nothing really worth mentioning here. They work with the characters and that’s that. Occasionally you’ll see an interesting shot that stands out, but for the most part they are average.Sound – I really enjoyed the OP song, but the ED is forgettable. There is a distinct ’90s feel to the sound design, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It works well here. The voice work is executed nicely and Karin’s is probably my favourite out of the lot. The range of emotions she goes through is nicely played out through the voice acting of Miina Tominaga. Word of advice though - do not watch the English dub because it’s horrid.Characters – Karin steals the show here. She’s very likeable and is the source of many of the laughs. Of course, Junta is an amusing character as well. You can’t help but feel sorry for him one minute and laugh at him the next. His mega playboy alter ego is less amusing however. He seems somewhat robotic and emotionless in his interactions with the others. Originally his actions were misleading me, as I wasn’t sure what to make of his other self. The rest of the cast, play out their supporting roles admirably, but some will make you wish they didn’t exist at all sometimes.Overall Experience:I liked it a lot for the first 7-8 episodes and then it got progressively less fun to watch, although it never got bad. The last arc made me shake my head and yet in the end I couldn’t help myself from liking it as a whole. Most of the reason lies in the art and Karin no doubt. Overall DNA2 wasn’t amazing, but definitely worth a watch. Now, whether this is your cup of tea or not, will likely depend on whether you grew up on old or new school anime. Keep in mind that this has very little action, even though the cover might suggest otherwise. Same goes for fanservice, if that’s what you’re looking for. The whole playboy bit of the summary might seem like it will lead to all kinds of ecchi scenes, but it keeps things on a tame level. In the end, if you don’t mind the retro feel this gives off then by all means check it out. underplayed. That’s probably for the better, since Junta is kind of dull in that form.

I try to avoid watching shows that take themselves too seriously and because of that its hard to make critical reviews for shows that don\'t take themselves seriously anyway. Lucky for the my millions of fanboys and tramps I\'ve found yet another show worthy of reviewing.Nigga DNA2 is flat out stupid. I revolves around a guy whos supposed to be a looser that has potential for a rare genetic...trait that would allow him to take over the world. No not really he could just bang and impregnate a hundred hoochies ( apparently this is supposed to be uncommon).It should have been calledl the ""Antonio Cromartie Story"" or Cromartie High School( I think someone already did that). This is near and dear to my heart because I know niggas like this,shit  my brother is like this. I had seven nieces and nephews by the same guy before I was ten, seriously.I saw all seven of them at the club last week. That ability however was not passed to me, I feel lucky enough to get some action that I wouldnt even consider askin for raw sex because I might not get no bunz at all if she say no. Anyway someone from the future is sent to stop this gene from activating so he won\'t overpopulate the planet when he passes it along to his one hundred seeds. They not only fail they partially activate the gene. Once again what fuckin gene? There are a lot more of these guys then people would think. Why bother stopping the gene? make him pay child support (hell of a contraceptive). He transforms a ton of times but sadly enough getting girls pregnant doesnt seem to be number one on his to do list, pun intended. More so he seems to just like seducing them.The art sucked but it had to be ok for the time. Same for sound. trait that would allow him to take over the world.

And naturally it was deemed by the EU-which is a big thing in Brussels-as a psychological warfare strike from the land of the rising east and was banned.No not really..Unfortunately this anime survives to this day so people of younger generations can also experience the terror.So far this sounds like any of...my reviews but this anime is so bad actually it\'s hillarious.DNA² may be the most ridiculous anime in existence. Wanna listen to the story? There\'s a DNA hunter named Karin,who was sent from the future to stop the so called Mega-Playboy,Junta, from fathering 100 kids that led to the overpopulation of the world.....Haven\'t passed out laughing, have we? Still with me?Right...Then, as a plot twist i suppose, we learn that Junto isn\'t a playboy at all..In fact he’s allergic to girls and vomits at the slightest sign of skin. So you might think that ok, maybe he\'s gay or something.. NOPE, wrong wrong wrong..I wish he was, cause at least that would be some form of explanation. As for his condition there are no explanations given..He just throws a pink coloured rocket when he sees a woman naked..My first thoughts-just by reading the story-were ""oh fuck"" and ""somebody pass me the Glock""..You have time travel and the first thing to do with it was stop a lad from impregnating 100 women and not stop Hitler? But they didn\'t.. Instead they sent the blue haired gal to shoot the unstoppable fucker from..Well..Fucking!""So how do you stop the sexual beast"", you might ask and the answer is with a DNA altering bullet to the head.But since this is an anime and the story had to last for 12 eps, Karin accidentally shoots him with the very bullet that awakens his inner playboy thus making him Caligula incarnate..With funnier Shayan-esque hair.Of course ALL the girls start dehydrating from lady juice overflow. Don\'t expect anything than the usual cast here. First of the bunch is Saeki, the hot girl that mocked Junta when his was an ordinary barfing loser, then there\'s Ami, the childhood friend who secretly loves him and is immune to his playboy trickery and last but not least Kotomi who farts whenever someone pays attention to her...........I have no words..And to end things the antagonist/ex Saeki\'s boyfriend who hates Junta and his new power up.What can you expect from this anime? Many nosebleeds, farting, vomiting, boobie grabbing scenes, face-to-ass trip overs and all the usual stuff we have come to expect from these type of anime.Other than that? No, not really much apart from the silly as fuck factor that keeps increasing as the episode count does.Be that as it may, it had it\'s funny moments. Like i said it\'s so ridiculous and bad it makes it hillarious. Its\' badness gives it character..Not a good one mind you, but still a character nonetheless.Animation was bad to the point of blindness even for it\'s time but then again i didn\'t expect anything grand from it. If i wanted Dragonball looking characters i\'d watch Dragonball.Voice acting was..I know i keep repeating myself but it was ridiculous. I think i\'ve heard more passionate book reading from morgue keepers but maybe that\'s just me..Still since the anime itself is bad the bad voice acting makes it even more of a character building experience.So it all comes down to this..Should you watch it?Fucking yeah you should.

I actually didn't know what to expect here, maybe just some rom-com which it's, in fact, something like that.The show's indeed somewhat cliche after all this anime was from the previous century, but the plot...it's fun and odd at the same time. I think this show has a good pace for the most part, but that's the thing 'most', it starts well, three episodes later it fully hooked me but at some point on the 8 or 9 episode the plot devolves instead of going up, all this because of the inclusion of the antagonist and his ridiculous power and toxic behavior, the cast of characters is generally ok with some flaws but the antagonist is really awful both in the plot and on the writing side.Another thing's that even if I didn't know what to expect from this I knew this wasn't supposed to be a battle shounen anime but toward the end, it heads toward that direction (BTW I heard that DNA2 mangaka and Dragon ball creator are friends so it's clear he received some inspiration from that). And I won't spoil anything but the end is good and bad, decent, but a questionable execution.summary:Story - 7: Interesting premise with a rom-com feel and a simple development but I think it works for the most part.Art - 8: Decent, but being a 1994 anime it has very good animation and a nice art styleSound - 8: I liked very much the opening performed by L'arc~en~Ciel and has good ending and insert songs.Character - 7: I especially liked the mc and Kotomi, Karin it's alright, but I especially disliked Ryuji which I think is 'somewhat' intended as he's the antagonist.Enjoyment - 7: Good at the beginning and middle part of the show but it lost its charm in the last episodes.Overall - 7As I said, the most interesting about this was the premise which has some elements of time travel on it, I liked the first 8-9 episodes but after that was like watching Dragon-ball with the super saiyan transformation and all, and the ending is acceptable but left some bitter taste on my mouth. it's fun and odd at the same time.

I think this is a show that gets more hilarious with age. But if you decide to take it too seriously I don't think you will get as much out of the show as you could.Story: Hilarious Premise but gimme moreeeThe premise of this show is great. A lady from the future visits our MC in order to prevent the disaster in her timeline where a man with tremendous charisma is so charming that he impregnates countless women and causes a crisis. I love it. The story seemed a bit rushed especially since the show claims to be...a harem. With a harem there should be proper attention given to all the chars in the love-triangle/love-decahedron. Especially the ending seemed extremely disorganized and abrupt as if the studio was on a schedule. Unfortunate.Art: EhhhThis the one area where time has not been gracious to the show. Art is a bit dated in the grand scheme of things though amongst the shows of it's era the art style is average. Because the action-packed scenes are fairly limited the animation is bearable.Sound: NoiceThe music delightfully upbeat and despite it being slightly cheesy does accurately color the hilarious character personalities. Especially the OP. Although you may not remember a great deal about this show after watching the music in the Opening is truly top tier. To the point of providing motivation to keep watching lol.Character: Funny but kind of in an ironic way.Because of the way the Characters interact with the silly premise allows for lots of laughs but also because of how ridiculous some of the situations were, there will be laughs from an ironic standpoint. Overall they enrich the world and setting in a great way.Overall Enjoyment: Definitely worth a watch, if only to add it to your library.This show is very amusing but the plot is a little out of the ordinary and it is not a legendary anime nor an epic anime by any means. Hell I'm not quite sure if there's much of a takeaway lesson at the end, but I was entertained all the way through. The only thing that will ruin the show is having high expectations so lower your standards rofl. Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person. a harem.

Can be painfully slow to watch depending on the person."", '*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge**This will be a review for both DNA² and DNA² OVA (episodes 01-15)*INTRODUCTION:DNA², an adaptaton from the manga, is set in our world during the nineties - the current decade when the anime was released. There is nothing unusual in this anime regarding to the setting - that is, besides the fact that a person came from the future to change another one and, possibly, save Earth\'s future. In that timeline, earth was suffering with overpopulation, which was mainly a single man\'s fault.The anime, despite being mainly a comedic, romantic ecchi, features some...battle shounen elements. Dragon Ball had been finding tremendous success by then, and a number of animes tried to implement some of its characteristics, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, DNA² is no exception to this.PLOT:Aoi Karin, a teenager from about one hundred years from when the story happens, is tasked to return to the past to prevent Momonari Junta from turning into Mega-Playboy - the one who impregnated a hundred different women, generating a cascade effect. By shooting him with a DNA altering bullet, he would never become Mega-Playboy, and the world would be saved. However, Karin is your typical clumsy protagonist, and she shoots a wrong DNA altering bullet through Junta, which prompts him to have eventual spasms of ""Mega-Playboyness"". When in that form, Junta has three main changes: women simply can\'t resist his manliness and immediately fall in love with him; he becomes stronger and more agile; and, lastly, he starts acting like... well... a ladiesman. Still, the change is not permanent, so Karin still tries to make things right.The interesting thing is that Junta has this weird disease in which he is allergic to girls - even though he wants to hang out with girls, when he sees a female body, he simply can\'t resist puking. Poor guy.The concept itself is as absurd as it sounds and, despite the initial curiosity one might feel, the plot isn\'t something to marvel at. It is, in fact, the anime\'s main weakness - don\'t expect complex events nor major plot twists. Knowing this, you can enjoy the show for what it is - a comedic (major trait) romance (minor trait), which it does impeccably. There are some simply genius situations which made me literally laugh out loud, unexpectedly.I found the entire cast pretty likeable (except for Ryuji, F this guy). Junta makes you feel unconfortable, whereas his MP counterpart makes you cheer for him. Karin is probably what others would call ""moe material"", as she is cute and quite pretty. Kurimoto Ami is probably the most relatable person in the entire anime. Saeki Tomoko and Takanashi Kotomi are both great characters as well, and their lives are pretty well explored. When the anime ended, the reason I felt the most sorrowful was that I wouldn\'t be seeing the characters again.The art style is definitely on-par with the epoch in which it was released. Episode\'s 1 prologue made me feel I was watching Buma coming out of the aircraft. Shadows are well explored, as are the expressions. Character\'s design are 90\'s standard material - Junta looks like a Yami Yugi and Goku mashup, which I do appreciate. Despite that, some special effects are simply terrible - the transformation to Mega-Playboy Junta is what comes to my mind. all in all, the art is fine. The sound direction at first did not amaze me - however, as the anime went on, I felt that it did fit the atmosphere. There is one small arc towards the middle of the anime in which music is somewhat important - that part was simply the most memorable for me.Unfortunately, as I pointed out in the introduction, DNA² features battle shounen elements. Notably, this change happens mainly towards the end - I felt that from episode 11 onwards I was watching another anime. Gone was what made the anime fun - Junta\'s interaction with all different females, Karin\'s clumsiness, Ami\'s insecurities, and all the small details that were featured here and there. ""Well, at least the story moved forward"", is what I can say about the ending. Episodes 11 and 12 were mostly awful due to a mini-arc. The OVA was also unsatisfying - its main problem is that it had three single episodes - by all that happened, it feels like it could have been at least half a season. The entire ending felt rushed and inadequate - I wasn\'t watching the anime for action, but that is what I got. The characters then introduced had no time to be developed at all, I simply couldn\'t care for them. I read somewhere that the manga does a better job regarding this, so the anime must have suffered from a budget problem.There are some other things I want to point out as well. Some interactions are bittersweet, making you care for the characters in question. The initial battle-shounen reference at the beginning of the anime was actually pretty good, it did catch me by surprise (in a good manner). As this is an ecchi, the female body was frequently depicted semi-naked or in tight clothing, and the camera angles favoured this as well. Also, for some reason, the fact that Karin could contact her boss from the future while still in the present made me mildly amused. Oh, and Junta\'s mom is the best.CONCLUSION:Despite the ending, I can safely say that DNA² was a blast to watch. I can\'t stress enough that my time with the show was over the top - up until episode 10 it was a solid 8, perhaps even deserving a 9. The problem is that the ending did leave a bad taste in my mouth - it was not what the fans deserved, it was not what the anime needed; it was simply a product of its time\'s popular shows. I will still recommend it to people, though I\'ll make sure to warn them about its flaws. One of these days I may check out the manga to know what the anime missed, changed or added. battle shounen elements.

This was a trash show that I could not finish. Not because it was boring or just did not interest me, but it was just that bad.Story: the concept was easy to fallow but the reason for why the plot happened was just like why? The idea of an over population of the earth in the future is a real Ecological idea, but how it came to be was just dumb. I only made it to the 4th episode and I gave up. Usually when I quit a show early...is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it. I did not hate the guy, actually I think he was the only person I liked.Karin: A time traveler who gives most of plot. She was annoying for she constantly had to remind me of her dream which was kind of normal I guess.Ami: Junta’s childhood friend and just annoying.Everyone Else: I was not completely sure but they were useless. is due to lack of interest.Characters:Junta: Our MC is okay but he is lacking in so many areas and the writers gave him some weird hidden ability to make up for it.

Like no shit its suppose to be cheesy.Story:As i said before main story is girl from the future goes to the past to stop someone from becoming a playboy and overpopulating the planet. By the way this someone has a bodily reaction towards girls that gets near him in which he throws up. Right here tells me this anime is more for jokes/comedy/harem then an actual serious story. Thats not a reason to...call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine. Gave me some laughs and you kinda get interested in karin\'s schemes on how she tries to stop the growth of the mega playboy, kinda episodic. Around 9 or 10 is where i have a big problem and for some reason the author wanted to include some super antagonist for some reason. It literally starts becoming DBZ/yuyu hakusho like which not a bad comparison but doesnt fit the flow of the show. It literally comes out of left field and had me in a wtf moment. Going into 12-15 the author kinda does a better job toning down the dbz nonsense and back to the shows reality a little bit by introducing a more realistic plot to the story. Imo this is what should have happen earlier ignoring all the DBZ stuff. However even with this introduction everything still felt rushed and out of nowhere. The ending was kinda meh. Could this have been written better? Of course? Is it that bad?? No. Compared to some of these newer nonsense ive seen worst.Characters:Karin: Future girl, seems alright. Was kinda annoying especially how many times she says mega playboy. Shes the whole im here for a paycheck attitude, though like most shows she starts developing feelings and has conflict between juntas feelings and her materialistic goals.Junta: Typical MC with typical MC hair. Clueless sometimes but clearly has a heart of gold and caring for his friends. Cant say hes bad when he has the typical MC role. Could have been written better.Ami: Oh japan here you go again with these ""read the air"" girls. For those that dont know what it means, it is notorious in japan. Its pretty much Junta having to guess what ami is thinking, and ami getting mad at junta cause he didnt guess properly instead of speaking her damn mind. So we get the whole ""ugh you\'re so inconsiderate >.<"" nonsense for no reason. So yea i found her annoying as i do with characters like that.Ryuji: Dont really want to talk much bout him for spoilers but i was just fine with him being just a jock or whatever.  Your ACTUAL typical playboy. Kind of a weird dude talking about DNA(which i think he means sex  but w/e) He starts becoming junta\'s rivial or enemy, he starts going into extreme stuff early on that caught me off guardArt:Im a sucker for retro art so my opinion is very biasedOverall:Its kind of a coin toss on whether id recommend this, if you dont mind alot of silliness then jumping into serious stuff without connection then yeah go watch. Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people. call this show bad at all. However there are major issues i have with this show which i give it a fair score. Episodes 1-8 or 9 were fine.

Again not bad just very hard to recommend this to people.', ""The story is cool but full of inconsistencies and holes. That would be alright but it's not funny either so it just ends up being boring most of the time. The only reason to watch is for nostalgic purposes.I watched the dubbed version. The main character was decent and even sounded as though he enjoyed his job at certain points. The same can't be said for any of the other characters who sounded like random pedestrians taken off the street before they had their morning coffee and were offered 5 dollars to read lines off a paper. Especially Tomoko, what the heck. "", 'The entire experience is a complete waste of time. 13 episodes done, and I feel as if I\'ve gotten no further in life. Absolutely nothing is achieved by watching this show, not even a slight improvement in your knowledge. All you need to know is that the main concept is that the main character has superpowered genetics that allow him to utilize the ""ultra-playboy"" powers of seduction and physical strength / intimidation. Basically, the MC can swoon any female in his presence and can intimidate / beat up any man in his sight. He becomes a saiyan-lite practically invincible character, the stakes are always low...since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors. Absolutely one of the lowest-effort shows I\'ve seen. If this has somehow made you more interested in the show then I\'ve failed. Just trust me when I honestly say that your life will be much better if you didn\'t even know this show existed. All you need to do is walk away and never think of this show ever again and you\'ll be ahead of me in life. Good luck. since you know it\'s going to be resolved, and the dub does it no favors.
