Baby Baachan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2732/Baby_Baachan,"[""I saw it 12 years ago when it was telecast-ed in my country India. I heard about the wisdom behind our old generation through the techniques delivered by my grand mother and some elders. But watching this anime made me learn more about such techniques that are useful for daily chores. I felt ignorant and was happy to learn something useful through an anime.Coming to the story, at first i can sympathise myself with the protagonist Amika. But at the same time i wished there could be a little sister like the baby baa-chan. But as the series progressed, i started to admire...her grandmother ( before she died) . In my view she did manage an island where she had to live in isolation but still she chose to  stand for the creatures of the island.  Amika's character represented well the mind-set of every teenage girl. The writer seems to have good observation skills. But Amika's personality changes by the end of the series.I recommend any girl who is self-oriented and sad that her wishes are not fulfiiled by her parents and grand-parents   are a head-ache. By watching this this kind of girls could start love their grand parents. I wish there were more 'family oriented' anime like this one. her grandmother ( before she died) .

NoLet\'s be honest,there little to nobody watch this show for the story alone... nobody watch it expecting there\'s some groundbreaking stories and intense or tragic scene, peoples watch this cause they wanna see anime girl\'s tiddies and thighs wiggle and jiggle,yes this is an anime where fanservice is it main point of interest and it do a pretty good job at it.Every scene is worth to watch and every design of the character is superb.Our main heroine is so cute,her thighs is a god gift and any other chara agree with it.Our genderbend MC already looks ""waifuable"" even when he\'s still in his male form,his female form ? Fcking perfection... everytime ""she"" moves ""it"" jiggles,""her"" panty shot...is perfection thanks to ""her"" skirt that is shorter than a bee life span.Our heroine\'s friend also seems cute and likeable or let just say,not hard for the eye.All characters are likeable, except that fcking cat,WHY DOES THAT CAT HAS TO EXIST ?the music is a total banger, it\'s like an unwritten rule that every ecchi anime will have an opening that can make you bang your head as hard as you want to bang the characters inside it.The graphic is decent, not the best but much better than just being ""watchable""Overall this anime is very recommended to ecchi fans that have a lot of time to waste and fine with watching 24 minutes of questionable things (like me) the only complain that i can give is the censorship.The censorship in this anime is a BITCH,at some points it\'s just a small censor using that annoying cat face but in some scene they just slap the fcking pictures of that car into the screen like it was some kind of posterWithout the censors,this show is a 10/10 for me,but for now since the censors is still the worse so far in 2020s i\'ll give It a 9/10 technique"" our MC turn into a girl ...yep that\'s basically the story in a nutshellis it original?

It basically tried to fuse those 2 shows, and it didn't excel in either. What happened. Why is everyone so apathetic towards this show. Needless to stay, this probably isn't getting another season based on comments from twitter, so we are reviewing this based on what is here so far. Yabuki may not get another series animated for a while.It wants to be an ecchi, wants to be an action show with lore, wants to be a romance, wants to be...a comedy. So there is a fundamental identity crisis. As an ecchi, it is incredibly uncreative an just goes for the usual topless scene, usually focused just on Matsuri. Compared to Love Ru, it just feels lazy.As an action show, nothing to write home about in 2023 with unimpressive action. It will look great in manga form, but this studio unfortunately won't be able to meet modern standards. Powers more or less ripping off Naruto characters like Sai and Ten Ten. Sosuke was a cool villain but unfortunately a fairly villain of the week one.The story lacks a lot of structure, and if you aren't a fan of his art style, you will likely lose interest fast. It switches between action then sol, and more or less does the same thing. As a result, the simplistic story is not going to cater interest. It more or less just there to explain the transformation and becomes less relevant later on.The biggest problem is definitely the characters since despite a smaller cast than TLR, Lucy and Yayoi feel way too secondary to even most of the TLR cast with no role to right home about. So there role feels gimmicky like Risa from TLR.Comedy was good at the beginning with the transition but sort of fizzledo out later on, and I don't think the romance is well written. It is basically I have feelings and such.He is a phenomenal artist but probably shouldn't try to tackle a manga by himself. To Love Ru didn't deserve to die for this. There are extremely talented writers like Koshi Tachibana that can fuse ridiculous fan service elements into an amazing epic. But Yabuki has shown he isn't one of them. a comedy.

It's really a shame that we probably won't see a second season (a somewhat weak start and its months-long hiatus didn't help it in that regard).

It doesn't show anything: all the 'important parts' are covered by a cat sticker in an almost mocking way. They're not subtle at all, and that's terribly irritating. What even is the point of watching it, then? Surely not for the plot or the characters, because those are abysmally generic and uninspired. It's stuff I've seen done way better a dozen times.Highschool DxD showed boobs and butts more than a decade ago and even managed to slap a hint of plot into it (enough not to make...me doze off while nothing of relevance was on screen if you know what I mean), while today, 2024, I need to buy a blueray to see some backwater, generic ecchi-supernatural anime as the author meant it - all that because the media industry is getting increasingly prudish. It's like removing all the blood and violence from, say, Chainsaw Man, and forcing you to buy the blueray to see them. What about no? What is the rating even there for?

Now look, this show is definitely not for everyone, I can understand this.Cons:The censorship sucks in a show that is suppose to be rated R+, and the scenes that show skin are even that bad, the ""sexual"" scenes are clothed, and just a little foreplay.  Yes, the humor is pretty dry and they skip around from the manga and (personal opinion) if they had follow the order and made it 10 episodes instead of 12, the consistency would be better.Pros: Opening is a banger, and the animation is pretty decent.  The character interactions...are more generic, but have a cute factor to it.  The cat makes this better than it is, and at times the action gets more intense than expected.  The balance of yuri, ecchi, plot, and humor is something I don\'t find much in anime nowadays, which this show does not too bad.MAIN POINT: Overall, Read the manga if you really want to enjoy this and support the author\'s work (who made To-Love Ru) or go watch one or two episodes and see if it\'s your cup of tea.  You want something to watch when you\'re bored, it got my stamp of approval. are more generic, but have a cute factor to it.

It's nothing new and there really isn't anything in here to completely revolutionize the anime world, but I still think it manages to stand apart a bit from the competition. So what is it that makes this anime worth a watch? Well...World & StoryThe premise is interesting and one that can be used with a lot of variation. There's not too much done with it though and I would have liked to see a bit more. The world is interesting and engaging and again, it leaves me with a taste for more. There's...a lot of potential here, just waiting to take things further. The story is a bit weak and while it works well enough for a 12 episode show I think more could have been done.Characters & WritingThe characters are fine and somewhat well written for such a short run, but the supporting characters do leave room for improvement. What I really like is that there's character growth and change, which is always welcome, and they make believable and reasonable decisions for the most part. The dialogue is quite standard and ends up in the category where it's neither bad or good enough to really take note of.Art & AnimationNothing exceptional here, but overall good quality art and fluid animations. It's easy to follow the action and to keep the characters apart. The design of the titular ayakashi is good and while it's perhaps not a feast for the eyes it's a solid dinner. I don't know if an uncensored version of this exists, but there are plenty of both panty- and nude shots that are covered up. They range from the slightly funny to the gratuitous and every single one is 100% fanservice.Music & SoundSolid, but not great. Pretty standard stuff here with little to say about it.Bits & BobsFirst, the ecchi parts feel like they're not really needed and the censoring does drive that home. No scene with nudity actually benefits from the nudity and the scenes that are about nudity are often just there for fanservice and cheap gags. I feel like they should either have gone for it a bit more or not made it ecchi in the first place. In fact, the series has enough going for it that the fanservice becomes completely unneeded. I could see this developing into a long series, but the ecchi actually holds it back from that.ConclusionA lot of potential and with a few tweaks it could become something great, but it's held back by the short season and ecchi elements. It's worth a watch if you like genderbender, supernatural stuff or censored ecchi, but if you don't watch it you won't miss too much.

Unfortunately like nearly all ecchi trash, the animation is not very good. Well, at least the first six episodes aren't good probably due to whatever was happening at Studio Connect that caused the series to go on hiatus for nearly half a year. The season's second half is much more stable in its story and in its animation.You can’t go wrong with characters designed by the artist behind To-Love-Ru. Masturi may be a good-looking ninja boy, but he's completely oblivious to how hot he is as a big-titted anime girl. Suzu is cute, has them thicc thighs that her friends like to point out and she's insanely horny which can lead to some surprisingly funny jokes. Jokes that are sometimes ruined by Shirogane pointing out how scandalous she is. There's also a pink-haired ninja tech nerd who can get very touchy-feely and even… sniffy. She's my favourite.Look, you know whether or not this is your thing. Yeah, it's trash, but it's at least watchable. There's better ecchi out there, obviously. Temple came out this season.

There are no ""classic"" characters, but rather original personalities with interesting emotions that are not commonly seen in other stories.The development of the story, although simple (we are not talking about Attack on Titan), is far above average anime.

She have no idea if it\'s true or not at that time. She know nothing about ayakashi2. She\'s an ayakashi miko. let me repeat. A FUCKING AYAKASHI MIKO who is consider as food by ayakashi to obtain an enormous of power. How stupid the character can be to just let the dude to...do ritual on something that consider as threat.

It just no no.', ""The anime follows the manga too closely and suffers as a result with jarring pacing issues, miscast characters, and intense censorship. While I enjoy Atakashi Triangle as a series, I would recommend picking up the manga over the anime.Visuals - As stated before, the anime generally follows the manga quite closely when borrowing its key visuals. These key visual are generally quite interesting overall though the anime often doesn't let key visuals really settle in and wow the audience before moving in to the next scene. Another issue with the visuals are transition scenes between the key visuals. These are quite boring and do...a poor job at keeping the audiences attention or setting up for the next scene. Finally, the color palette of this anime is too oversaturated. The striking colors of the main characters falls flat due to how colorful all of the backgrounds are taking away from their strong designs.Audio - Suzu is super miscast with her VA being a bit too meek and unable to really deliver the childhood friend dynamic between herself and Matsuri. I also find that the shift in Matsuri's voice is a bit to strong and FMatsuri doesn't give off the cool but also awkward vibe the manga goes for. Music is forgettable overall.Story - While the story of Ayakashi Triangle is a bit of a roller coaster and is hard to capture, the anime is unable to capture the essence of the series and let serious moments sink in while silly moments often go on for a bit too long. Breaking away from the structure of the manga somewhat would seriously enhance the pacing of the story and a lot of fat could be trimmed. a poor job at keeping the audiences attention or setting up for the next scene.

Nothing to blow you away, but it's not bad.The character design, however, felt incredibly boring. All of the characters either look cliché, boring, or just plain silly. The MC doesn't need to dress like a comic book super-hero, considering that they're simply a ninja that exorcises spirits. Not only that, but the evil spirits weren't much to bring excitement. I get it, they're classic Japanese folklore, so considering that, they did well with the monster design, making traditional demons look pretty cool, but the over-all premise of them is really nothing original.If you're simply into...ecchi, that's really all this show gives up. Everything felt very predictable, even the somewhat humorous situations that they fall into. ecchi, that's really all this show gives up.

Brothers Conflict: Setsubou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22745/Brothers_Conflict__Setsubou,"[""Brothers Conflict is my bias so take this review with a grain of salt.I like this special A LOT because it gives most of the brothers a chance to fantasize about their life with Ema if their wish came true. The personalities in this special are consistent with their characters in the main storyline so it's not like an alternate reality setting where only one guy has feelings for her and all the others suddenly don't for the sake of an offshoot episode. It's a trait I've always loved about Brothers Conflict. It's very fair to each love interest; they have equal opportunity to win...Ema's heart.The music, art, and atmosphere are consistent with the main anime, so if you enjoyed those aspects before, you'll enjoy them again cause they're the same. The music's always been one of my favorite features of Brothers Conflict and it's a shame I can't seem to find the official soundtrack.My only gripe with this special is the omission of the brothers Hikaru, Iori, Kaname, Louis, Masaomi, Ukyo, and Wataru. It makes sense why they weren't there, but I happen to love all the brothers, especially Wataru, and it was disappointing they weren't featured here. I can understand however due to time constraints it may have been necessary to omit their perspectives.I recommend this of course to anyone who enjoyed Brothers Conflict, but if you didnt like the series initially, this special won't change your mind.

Chance Triangle Session,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2495/Chance_Triangle_Session,"[""It always blows my mind when I start a new series and poof, no review! How on earth will I decide whether I want to watch it or not? Well no matter, I will say Chance Pop Session from the desolate world of no-review land.I'd been wanting to see this anime for some time now, ever since I saw a scene on Youtube that was easily the sweetest clip ever. After two weeks of life kicking my butt, it was time. And my timing was just about perfect. This is the show you want to come home to after a bad day. At some...points I felt myself get all relaxed, like I was either waking up or lulling into a pleasant nap. It was sweet, it was calming, it wasn't boring. Just the type of show to lift one's spirits.Unfortunately, this doesn't mean the show is perfect. It has its flaws right along with it's good points. The plot was...predictable. There really weren't any surprises to be had and I could easily figure out what was going to happen before it did. It all became a matter of just watching the events unfold. The anime didn't even try to hide the obvious plot points, instead opting to concentrate more on how the story was told rather then what story was told. Which is OK. It's nice to just sit back and enjoy the ride once in a while. But if you're the type of person who loves deep, hidden plot goodies and mysteries to uncover and unravel as the show goes on, look elsewhere.I have mixed feelings about the art.  The art style was different. At times it seemed bland, but then they'd just go into something completely different. I loved the attention to detail, just little things that they were very good about keeping on top of. Also every so often a little music video would appear (oh yes) and the art goes through some drastic changes in one or two of them, but they fit the mood and it just worked.And now the music. I had to get to this at some point in a musical anime. I am so lucky I actually liked the songs, because they sure liked to repeat them. It started to remind me of transformation sequences in magical girl anime; they showed the same scene for the one song every time. I was so relieved when the music videos came on, because that meant something different, but the second I saw three microphones appear out of nowhere I knew I was in for yet the same recycled scene. Don't get me wrong, I found myself humming some of the songs cheerfully in the shower this morning. It just would have been nice to see them singing something new.The characters were all-around decent. There wasn't any substantial character development, but as I mentioned before the attention to detail is amazing. Especially when it comes to their unique personalities. All of the characters served their purposes, none were wasted and it worked. Nothing to call home about really.Despite how this review may sound, I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It had a nice little message, got rid of some stress and had some nice music. I would most definitely recommend giving it a show. Just don't go in expecting a monumental work of art. The charm of this show is that it does not take itself too seriously and try to be something it's not.

Its just as the other reviewer said.  Everyone should know how the story will play out ahead of time.  Luckly, the way that it does is entertaining enough.The art on the other hand...Is barely serviceable I thought this show was made in the late 90's and then I come to learn it was actually 2001?  How is this possible?  Why don't music shows by Madhouse productions...get good art.  I found myself fast forwarding through some of the poor clips.The sound is what you'd expect from a music show.  The songs are good...in small doses. If you don't like the opening song of this anime, don't watch it.  They sing it atleast twice an episode.  When some other songs come into the mix its a breathe of fresh air.  Its not that its a bad song, just over played.  The other musical selections are very good its just they're not played nearly as often.The characters are great.  Sure they seem common, but I just felt there was something special about how the characters interacted.  There wasn't a character that came into the screen that felt fake.I really did enjoy this show overall.  It does have its points where it goes off track and you wish they'd play another song.  The show has great characters and the way it plays out is a lot of fun.  It was sports one of the more satisfying endings I've seen in an Anime.  If you get a Chance,  give Chance Pop Session a try.

I decided to finish the series even though the start was very poor and cluttered.Overall the story was poorly done and predicable for the most part.  The plot left very little to be desired and most anyone could guessed the outcome after just 4 episodes.  Character development was very poorly executed and left the characters seeming shallow.  Also, the background stories left some of the main characters unlikable by the end of the series.The animation for this series did not help...the series either.

Chance Pop Session\'s answer is to have highly interesting sub-plots that somehow sharpens the main story, incredibly well cast seiyuus and relatable characters. It seems with such a great combo, everything just comes together.What also makes it so good is that it never drags on with the story or any of the situations so much that it puts you off. Instead, those stories are so well put together that you really feel the impact of the anime as a whole.The animation for this title is good but has a couple of kinks. I\'ll start with...the bad.Some backgrounds are very uninteresting and plain, but more annoyingly they have static background people when everyone should be moving, like in a crowd scene. This feels a little cheap and quite disappointing compared with other elements of the show.The character design is also one that the audience has to get adjusted to because it is somehow plain looking and static. However after a few episodes - once you get used to it - you can start to appreciate it as it creates an interesting dynamic with both the boring background but also with the vivid ones.Now to the good.Some sequences are just breathtaking and powerful in their depiction of a mood. For instance, the visuals that go with Reika\'s songs are amazing. The kind of stuff that would make Gankutsuou proud in its use of patterns, intense colour and flowing objects. Those sequences have to be seen to be believed.Other scenes that reflect the great artistry are also dream sequences that involve Akari and Kaito, the moody piece that is the past of Kasaragi and some of the concert shots. Chance Pop Session also manages to include live action (just in the way of objects though) exceedingly well in some sequences (even better than End of Evangelion if you ask me).The seiyuus are probably the best thing about the show as they elevate the characters with incredible performances. Their understanding of human emotion shines through (especially) Kasaragi, Akari, Nozomi and Reika. They depict the characters with restraint, which is to be applauded since this is a shoujo. You can even feel that they understand their character\'s emotions and that just makes them more relatable.The songs are also quite magical (as one would expect from the show setup). The intro ""Pure Blue"" is an excellent piece of JPop that is quite inspired. ""Love Forever"" is in the same vein. The standout track for me is Reika\'s single as it depicts the sense of longing that runs through the show very convincingly.The story is about three different girls wanting to because a pop star. They all do it for different reasons. Akari wants to reach people with her songs, Nozomi wants it because of her admiration for Reika and Yuki wants it to prove something to herself. With all these cheesy reasons, it is a wonder how the show manages to be successful. Well the way it does it, is that it shows you the reason why they feel that way. Once you get that understanding of the characters in your mind, you start to root for them, as they are relatable people.The story takes some very interesting (if a bit predictable) turns along the way that just intensifies the tension and fine tunes the drama. The incredible thing is that you can see where it is all going but somehow, you\'re at the edge of your seat anyway.The only issue I have with the story is that it is at first quite slow, you have trouble really getting into it and it wasn\'t until about episode 4 that I was interested to see what happens.I have delved into the characters a bit in the story and sound paragraph. Shoujos usually do characters well and this is no exception. I will just add that the reason everything comes together is because the characters are so efficient. They are efficient in making you feel for them, and when you do connect with the characters the rest is just a breeze. Everything comes together and you get a very enjoyable and satisfying ending.This series is easily one that I will view again as the 13 episode format is not an intensive task.

The cover art on the DVD insert is way WAY more ecchi than the show itself, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The one thing that made this show worth watching were the characters and for me personally, the English voice cast from ADV Films.  The 3 main heroines are voiced by Kelli Cousins, Hilary Haag & Monica Rial.  The story is melodramatic to the point of silly, which is unintentionally funny.  It\'s very much like a an American soap opera plot.  The bones...of a good story are here, and this series would make excellent fodder for a re-make.  It just needs more music, more conflict, more sexiness, etc.  The original here is pretty mediocre and bland but a thoughtful remake could be potentially great.  The core story could\'ve been told in a 6 episode OVA.  A full 13 episodes just feels bloated and unnecessary for what we\'re given.The artwork has a few moments that are really great (mostly the impromptu music video scenes serving as a plot montage to show passage of time or character growth) but mostly it\'s pretty bland, even by 1990s standards.  Some of the characters\' facial expressions fall into unnatural, creepy ""uncanny valley"" territory during some of the dance sequences.  Also, I get that music licensing can be very expensive but WOW did the main R3 song get repetitive and boring...seeing the girls rehearse other songs or even try writing their own lyrics would\'ve improved the story 100%; also it would\'ve been better showing them doing all the other things performers typically do in Japan such as being interviewed on radio stations, or doing work on tv commercials, dealing with obsessive fans & paparazzi, etc...these aspects of idol careers are hand-waved away or dealt with for only a few seconds at a time.  The best that can be said is this show was the forerunner of much better idol stories yet to come.  I guess tween &  young teen women are the intended audience for a show like this, not male Gen Xers like me. of a good story are here, and this series would make excellent fodder for a re-make.

Especially the characters aren\'t really characters at all. This is most notably in how single-minded everybody is. Especially Nozomi\'s father is probably the biggest liability to this series. There are two dedicated episodes just for his mistakes and the viewer simply wonders afterwards in how he became a rich man. He certainly can\'t see beyond the next action of his.But let\'s roll back a bit. Chance Triangle Session is about 3 young woman who aspire to become vocalists, as they say. And the story tries to focus on that aspect alone. However, the story fails to acknowledge on how much work that actually encapsulates. And while we can see that the girls train every day, we don\'t see or hear any progress. And even tho the beginning and end are seasons apart, they still sound indifferent to me. And the fact that this music themed anime only has 4 tracks with lyrics doesn\'t help at all. Especially since the opening sound is used as their debut song. And even for big moments they replay the whole opening in its 1:30 minute version. No extra lines and no full version. Simply the anime opening.The beginning also a similar issue, but more in the logical aspect. One of the girls performs as a street singer in a small band. But whenever we cut to the crowd they always play the same song and they still have a big crowd where people film them and put the videos online. This was far before the time of Youtube and even smartphones and literally can be summed up with ""play the same song again"".The music isn\'t the only thing that repeats. The animation also really likes to replay the same shots over and over. It isn\'t as bad as the music, but still it puts an emphasis on how the music industry repeats certain trends.The final thing I really want to talk about is the story structure. Because it is abysmal to say it nicely.<Heavy Spoilers onward>First of all, for a drama, it doesn\'t hold any tension. There are absolutely no stakes in anything and everything is resolved within the same episode. The death by truck episode is probably the absolute worst of them all.

Additionally characters also leave the plot entirely, like the single singer rival or the bullies, not the mention the entirety of the rest of the music school.In total, Chance Triangle Session is hampered mainly by its writing and focus on the journey of the main cast. But this journey leaves out everything that makes the end goal interesting. The staff surrounding the idols is as important as they themselves, simply because they are dependent on each other. This is especially noteworthy when the manager of the top star quits to become the school teacher. And the reason was simply: ""She can handle it herself."" No, she can\'t!

Despite being marketed as a sequel in several anime database websites, this anime is nothing more than a reboot of the original story. The story focuses on Hani's life, and the characters from the original anime have undergone some changes. Unfortunately, this 'second season' fails to capture the spirit of the original series.— ORIGINS —Dallyeola Hani was a highly popular sports anime series in South Korea that first aired in 1988 and was a faithful adaptation of the...manhwa. It revolved around the coming of age story of a young girl named Hani, who had a deep passion for running. The anime quickly gained widespread acclaim, developed a large following among viewers, and even appeared in several Korean TV commercials. However, the subsequent anime adaptation titled 'Cheonbangjichuk Hani' was loosely based on the source material and failed to live up to expectations, falling short in comparison to the original series.— PLOT —As a standalone anime, Cheonbangjichuk Hani is a disappointing watch. The plot lacks cohesion and feels somewhat episodic. In contrast to the original anime, which revolved around the theme of running, this adaptation has no connection to running whatsoever. Instead, it primarily focuses on Hani's life and her relationships with her mother, who is alive in this version. Unfortunately, this addition doesn't integrate well with the overall narrative and feels like a random subplot inserted into a sports story. Consequently, the story fails to capture the same level of excitement and passion that made the original anime so compelling.— CHARACTERS —One of the biggest disappointments was the way the characters have been developed. The original characters have lost their appeal, and their personalities have undergone significant changes. For example, Hani's father, who was previously mostly absent in the original anime, is now Hani's PE teacher for some reason. This change may have been made to make the story more relatable, but it fails to add any real value to the plot. Additionally, the new characters that have been introduced don't fit well with the original cast.In the original Dallyeola Hani anime series, Hani's relationship with her coach was portrayed as a father-like figure, which added depth to the character's development and created a unique emotional connection with the audience. However, in the reboot, this aspect of the story was diminished, and the new coach here was portrayed merely as a coach without any personal connections. This decision removed a significant appeal of the original series.— FINAL THOUGHTS —While the anime may have some redeeming qualities, such as sharing the same quality of animation and soundtrack, and featuring the same voice actors as the original series, it pales in comparison to its predecessor. It's best to avoid this anime as it may ruin your last impression of Dallyeola Hani and end up wasting your time. However, if you're still curious and insist on watching it, be prepared for disappointment. manhwa.

Eden's Bowy,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1189/Edens_Bowy,"['A really great series and you can find a dub version out there. I tried to watch this once and discarded it because it had an older artwork look. I came across it again and watched two episodes and was hooked. Not only does it have a great storyline, but it also has some comedy mixed in that makes you laugh. Not many anime actually humor me. ', 'Eden’s Bowy made for a solid fantasy/ adventure series focused on the journey of Yorn, Elisiss and Ulger Dyne as they tried tracking down the whereabouts of Yorn’s father and dealt with hostilities they faced from those in the floating cities of Yulgaha and Yaunes. The series does a great job at fleshing out many of its prominent characters and exploring the world in which Eden’s Bowy takes place. Many of the characters that the series focuses on are involved with and have had tragic pasts and developments that they are trying to overcome while dealing with the hostilities from the actions of authority figures...in both of the floating cities. The most interesting of these developments for me came from the story concerning Hairra’s origins which proves to be quite the tragic one and effects the developments of Fennis and Vito’s characters throughout the series as they handle her not so normal situation and being pawns of the crooked Yulgaha priests.The show also does a solid job at its world building to establish the different societies that those on the ground, Yulgaha and Yaunes have. Yulgaha and Yaunes are seen as very sophisticated societies in the future setting of Eden’s Bowy which shows itself rather well with the seemingly modern city landscape of Yulgaha and the futuristic like environment of Yaunes. This is considerably different compared to the barbaric and feudal lifestyles and clothing that those on the surface experience and dress in on a regular basis. The series does resort to the typical “science vs religion” clash between Yaunes and Yulgaha as their societies are governed by both respectively (Yaunes uses mecha, Yulgaha having six magical priests) and use them as their primary means of combat.In terms of plotting, Eden’s Bowy switches its focus between the differing factions and characters seen throughout the series with Yorn’s group, the six Yulgaha priests, Hairra and her group, Yaunes leader Nyako and her two incompetent cohorts and Yorn’s rival Spike Randit. The series takes its time unraveling the true nature and goals of these various characters and factions with the first half mostly focused on exploring its world and the situations faced by its characters yet dropping hints of tensions developing between the factions and motives of the characters. The second half is when the plot starts to escalate when Yulgaha and Yaunes finally go at each other’s throats, some characters come to terms with the problems they have faced throughout the show and we come to learn more of the mysteries surrounding a few key characters alluded to from earlier episodes. The show reasonably explores its world and develops both its plot and characters within its 26 episodes without leaving behind too many loose ends.If there is one major problem I had with Eden’s Bowy, it would have to be that those within Yaunes are quite underdeveloped compared to what we see of Yorn’s group, Spike and characters within Yulgaha. For the most part, characters in Yaunes seemed to be used as some form of comic relief throughout the series, especially in the case with Nyako’s two incompetent cohorts she sends to capture Yorn. While comedic moments with these characters were effective for the most part and didn’t do too much in killing the more serious mood of Eden’s Bowy in later episodes, it would have been nice if these characters were given more serious moments for me to connect with them, especially as the only Yaunes character with any reasonable development was Nyako’s niece/ second-in-command.In terms of presentation, Eden’s Bowy does have a solid visual presentation with clean details and good color shading with its settings and character designs. It does a good job at showing detail and vastness with a diverse number of environments such as a desert, mountain areas and the city environments of both Yaunes and Yulgaha. Character designs have a decent amount of detail applied to them and are appealing on the eyes as well. The show does usually resort to animation shortcuts such as reused and still frames, but the quality does improve in later episodes and has its moments during battle scenes.Eden’s Bowy did a solid job in keeping me entertained throughout its 26-episode run. The series did a good job at developing and exploring its world and characters, as well as slowly building up its plot while adding in the occasional comedy moments with the characters to ease the mood from tense developments or a couple filler episodes. This is a definite watch if you are looking for a good fantasy/ adventure anime to get into, especially as this title seems to be fairly obscure to most anime fans. in both of the floating cities.

The internal struggles of the characters, especially Yorn and Elisiss, are great. And the haunting past of Spike, he is one of my favorite characters. Now granted, don't watch it expecting the smooth art style of anime done today but it's the older style that makes it lovable too. If you like fantasy type anime then at least give it a try and hopefully you won't be disappointed. "", ""Edens Bowy was one of those anime i glanced at and thought it would be rather dry and sad in comparison to other anime of its time, i was wrong. I found great enjoyment when watching this anime, it seemed a lot more mature than it looked and used a lot of themes that a mature audience may appreciate more.Visually Edens Bowy is great in most aspects, i think they made the female lead very badly with her gigantic elf ears and pulled back hair. It makes her look more like a alien than anything else. I consider this a major problem since its hard...to for me to see past her design even her colors kinda throw me off cause it goes /brown/off pink/puke green as you scan down her body. She reminds me of a really  distance cousin of one of the girls from Oh My Goddess with her forehead symbols and such.The main lead resembles quite a few male leads from the early 90s to 80s with his red hair, blue clothes and largely over sized sword.I felt some of the best art was in the villains and landscapes/city's. I think the Gods themselves set themselves a huge distance away from anything else in the show visually and i liked that cause it gave them a very strong presence and serious tension when they appear. I also liked the backgrounds and general artistry of the the upper city, it reminds me a lot of a lot of other great anime of that time who used themes like past advanced civilizations and future technology existing in a small segment of the world.The characters of Edens Bowy feel very right for the plot in most instances, i feel like the main characters could have been a little older to make the show look a little more serious though. I also acknowledge the theme of using young characters is because they want to create a greater feeling of helplessness and fighting against fate and such. Having children face God,Creation and Existence itself is a heavy theme and tossed in with romance you can see them struggle harder and harder for a more triumphant outcome.Ultimately i think Edens Bowy is something i have truly and honestly enjoyed in its entirety. With a few improvements it could have been a highly acclaimed classic. I feel like if you have a interest in classic anime you should really give this a watch since it is a very forgotten yet enjoyable title. I can also see where other people would be critical of this anime but i think if you give it a honest chance you will walk away enjoying it. to for me to see past her design even her colors kinda throw me off cause it goes /brown/off pink/puke green as you scan down her body.

Totally disturbing. I think it has to be the most disturbing thing I have watched so far. It definitely got me hooked. It was fun seeing the story unfold. It all added to the narrative. I love a good story. This definitely has been that for me so far.I found great enjoyment when watching this anime. At first glance, the anime does not look like it has mature themes.It is an old anime, so I will not criticise the art because I feel it was good for its time. The anime art is defo not...as sweet as it is today. as sweet as it is today.']"

Gakkatsu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13139/Gakkatsu,"['[Final Update: Finished Watching the Series]Never underestimate a childish anime. From beginning to end ""Gakkatsu"" kept me entertained. Each character had their own charisma and made the show more fun to watch. In terms of short anime I have watched before, this really stands among the top. My only complaint is that it was too short.Story: 9The idea of a curious classmate leading a class in a discussion, made me curious. She leads the class not in discussing things in textbooks or about what they should be doing, but rather learning about life. They are not bound by the ideals of man and with their...innocent hearts come to conclusions about various things. This often leads to hilarious conclusions to perhaps complicated thoughts. That is one of the reasons this show is enjoyable. I would have liked it if this actually happened when I was in high school. I would have never had a boring day if homeroom was like that every day.Art: 9The thing that originally hooked me on to this anime is the unique art it had. A sort of rock & roll animation with some grunge art. Right off the bat I knew this was going to be a unique anime. Also the chibi-esque animation of the characters made it speak to the rebellious mind of a teen. ""I reject your reality, and replace it with my own"". That\'s what this art screamed to me and that why I started watching this anime.Sound: 8Considering this was a short anime show, I didn\'t expect much from this anime in terms of sound. Well I was right, and my expectations were met, nothing bad or good to say about the sound. Of course, it\'s nowhere close to Beethoven\'s Symphonies, but it was a good fit for the show.Character: 9The thing that stood out most about the anime were the characters. Each was so unique that you forgot what the unique really meant. The energetic class president that brings up amazing debates with conclusions that sometimes confounded me (as well as made me laugh), and the classmates which include: the class rebel, the smartest guy in the class, a random bunny as a mascot, two foreigners (one from space), the nice girl in the class, the wise one, the quiet guy with a motorcycle helmet, and etc. The way they interact with each other makes the show what it is: ""Gakkatsu"", otherwise known as ""Homeroom"". The time which they spent discussing would be very boring if they weren\'t so unique.Enjoyment: 9The anime overall was great. It may not be a masterpiece, but I sure as hell enjoyed it. The comedy in this anime is great. Even though it\'s only five minutes long, it feels like I watched a 20 minute episode. I\'m looking forward to future episodes. Every single one so far was great.Overall I liked this anime a lot, and I\'m sure others will as well. Therefore I will give it a 9 out of 10.___After watching those wonderful extra episodes I can say this. If you would like to watch an anime with a smile on your face then this is the one for you.

Being the class president, Takachiho uses the time to debate a certain topic every episode. That\'s basically it.

Simple, and that\'s why I like it. Throughout each episode, a pop rock riff plays in the background and unexpectedly helps set up each joke and punchline.

Grendizer: Getter Robo G - Great Mazinger Kessen! Daikaijuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3481/Grendizer__Getter_Robo_G_-_Great_Mazinger_Kessen_Daikaijuu,"['I decided to watch this as a soft introduction to UFO Robo Grendizer, which has yet to be fully subbed. Well, at least not by people who speak English. Getter Robo G and Great Mazinger also aren\'t fully available yet as far as I know, but I\'m more familiar with their respective franchises. In this 30 minute crossover movie, the aforementioned main characters team up to tackle the deadly DRAGONSAURUS... which looks neither like a dragon nor a dinosaur. It\'s more like a giant jellyfish with a face and sea serpent hydra-like heads instead of tentacles.But hey, in this universe Japan\'s greatest scientists aren\'t known...for their etymology skills but rather for creating the ""world\'s most powerful robot army"". You\'d assume there wouldn\'t be much competition if Texas Mack is anything to go off of, but hey, they\'re our only defense against the Dragonsaurus which literally eats oil tankers like crackers. The Dragonsaurus is specifically after Japan\'s oil in the vein of classic not-so-subtle environmentalist kaiju monsters. There\'s a line thrown aside by one of the scientists that this is humanity\'s fault for dumping oil into the ocean. A pretty immoral practice in any case, but I\'m not so sure they really deserve the blame for this one. It\'s not like the Dragonsaurus didn\'t exist until oil got dumped into the water, and it\'s reasonable to assume no giant monsters or living creatures of any sort would live off oil but hey whatever. And oil has no mutating powers. Whatever the reason, Dragonsaurus was there, now it\'s here, and it\'s famished for fossil fuels.Crossover aside, this is completely classic mecha action. This means a lot of our heroes getting slapped around as they call out the names of each of their attacks that do nothing to the Jellyhydrasaurus. Boss Borot makes a special guest appearance here but only manages to get himself eaten. The highlight of the movie is when Great Mazinger enters the monster\'s stomach to save him and for some reason the entire place is bathed in a rotating rainbow light. Diana A and Venus A appear as well and shout ""lady robots can fight too!"" but as always end up doing absolutely nothing. It takes until the end of the movie until our heroes realize that since the monster is a living oil keg that they could just kill it by tossing a lit match down its throat, but naturally they go for a much more grandiose explosion because that\'s what would make this job worth doing.Anyway, eh... even in the context of its era, ""Grendizer, Getter Robo G, Great Mazinger: Battle! Giant Sea Beast"" doesn\'t particularly stand out. As far as I know no additional lore is developed here like in Great Mazinger vs. Getter Robo which introduced GilGilGan, who would make several Super Robot Wars appearances. (Edit: I was incorrect! Dragonsaurus does make some SRW appearances, just not in any I\'ve finished.) The culled cast from each series almost don\'t interact with each other, and when they do it\'s in the context of their work and nothing personal to develop a relationship between them. So it all feels like a standard monster-of-the-week episode that just happens to feature more attacks than usual in one place. The animation is fairly fluid for a 1976 anime but otherwise not spectacular, and the score is the usual other than the cute, short original theme song written for the movie. I generally don\'t go for this kind of mecha anime, and if you do you don\'t really need my opinion to know that you can\'t get enough of this stuff. Thank you to /m/subs for allowing us all to watch this in such great quality, and the subs themselves are pretty much perfect. If by chance any of you are reading this, I hope some day you can find time to transfer your subs to the Layzner blu-rays. It looks like a great series, and I\'m holding out for it! Well, that\'s about enough. This crossover is all of the first things you\'d probably expect. for their etymology skills but rather for creating the ""world\'s most powerful robot army"".

The highlight of the movie is when Great Mazinger enters the monster\'s stomach to save him and for some reason the entire place is bathed in a rotating rainbow light. Diana A and Venus A appear as well and shout ""lady robots can fight too!"" but as always end up doing absolutely nothing. It takes until the end of the movie until our heroes realize that since the monster is a living oil keg that they could just kill it by tossing a lit match down its throat, but naturally they go for a much more grandiose explosion because that\'s what would make this job worth doing.Anyway, eh... even in the context of its era, ""Grendizer, Getter Robo G, Great Mazinger: Battle! Giant Sea Beast"" doesn\'t particularly stand out. As far as I know no additional lore is developed here like in Great Mazinger vs. Getter Robo which introduced GilGilGan, who would make several Super Robot Wars appearances. (Edit: I was incorrect! Dragonsaurus does make some SRW appearances, just not in any I\'ve finished.) The culled cast from each series almost don\'t interact with each other, and when they do it\'s in the context of their work and nothing personal to develop a relationship between them. So it all feels like a standard monster-of-the-week episode that just happens to feature more attacks than usual in one place. The animation is fairly fluid for a 1976 anime but otherwise not spectacular, and the score is the usual other than the cute, short original theme song written for the movie. I generally don\'t go for this kind of mecha anime, and if you do you don\'t really need my opinion to know that you can\'t get enough of this stuff. Thank you to /m/subs for allowing us all to watch this in such great quality, and the subs themselves are pretty much perfect. If by chance any of you are reading this, I hope some day you can find time to transfer your subs to the Layzner blu-rays. It looks like a great series, and I\'m holding out for it! Well, that\'s about enough. This crossover is all of the first things you\'d probably expect.']"
Gatchaman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3154/Gatchaman,"['Gatchman is...fine. This 3 episode OVA update of the 1970s original Science Ninja Team Gatchaman is a decent enough effort. The character designs by Yasuomi Umetsu are solid (though I admittedly like the original series art more), and it is pretty action packed with fluid animation. The story is par for the course, alien invaders and all that, but it moves along at a brisk pace. My biggest issue is trying to give Gatchaman a darker tone. It works at times, particularly when non costumed characters are on screen. But the second the Ninja Teams or villains show up in costume...well, it\'s just silly and...doesn\'t work. I guess after 8Man After and Casshan: Robot Hunter, this sort of update was inevitable at the time.

Joou Heika no Petite Angie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3435/Joou_Heika_no_Petite_Angie,"[""There were no reviews for this show at the time of writing this so I thought I'd give some quick thoughts to anyone who happens to stumble upon this show. I know it's made for kids, but I'm of the belief that even kids shows can be watched and critiqued regardless of age.Story - This is an episodic mystery series, with no overarching story (although the last episode is suitable as a conclusion for a show like this). The cases for the most part are very predictable. The culprits are almost always either random thugs or completely sympathetic with little to no grey area between...these extremes. Often Angie only solves the case from absolute luck or coincidence rather than intelligence. Many episodes have boring chase scenes on foot or horseback that overstay their welcome.Characters - Characters are the crux for any good episodic series but they are very weak in this show. The only somewhat interesting character is Angie but every other main and recurring character are defined almost entirely by being either a) just there to take orders from Angie or b) resist her help irrationally. The comedic relief detective is not very funny and usually has weak synergy with the rest of the main cast. This show badly needed more interesting mains or at least semi-recurring villains and rival detectives.Art - The animation and art style is passable, but many of the character designs throughout the show are quite bland. I have not watched many shows from the 70s so I'm not sure how it compares to its contemporaries.Sound - I liked most of the instrumental pieces and thought they usually set the mood pretty well. However, the sound design was not as good. Often times certain sound effects were too loud and annoying such as horse hooves or footsteps during chase scenes.Enjoyment - Overall this show was very mediocre in terms of its mysteries and characters, so it was not too enjoyable. Certain episodes did show some potential, such as a hot air balloon hostage situation, or episode 25 which had rival detectives, a better scenario for the comedic relief detective, and more dynamic chase scenes. However, these moments where the show differentiated itself were very few in number.Overall I rate this show as a 3 since while the art and sound are passable, the story and characters are both considerably below average. An example that comes to mind for a kids show in the episodic mystery genre (although not an anime) that still holds up and does what I think Angie needed to are many versions of Scooby Doo, which have memorable characters and lean into their goofiness. these extremes.

Citrus,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34382/Citrus,"['Citrus is a series that is tragically misunderstood; a story with far more substance and depth than word of mouth would lead you to believe. Not long after this show started airing, it’s become easy for people to write off any element in the story as a means to arbitrarily wring out some voyeuristic lesbian action, rather than stopping to think of the purpose it actually holds for the narrative. When a sexual assault occurs, viewers assume that it’s romanticizing such an action and therefore condones it. When an emotional barrier props up, it’s assumed to be nothing more than a way of piling on...more drama. These premature assessments are commonly made when shows like this are perceived as simple fetish material, framed as horribly misplaced criticisms that leave Citrus in an undeservedly contemptuous light; as a guilty pleasure unworthy of further analysis or appraisal. Citrus is not mere fetish material, does not promote or romanticize sexual assault, and provides layered and well-developed characters whose actions are realistically influenced by both internal and external conflicts. A bittersweet feeling perpetuates as we follow naive teenagers consistently characterized as those who are lost and confused, behaving in ways that are less than ideal, but are hurdles along the way of a gripping and emotionally compelling tale that is certainly rough around the edges, but well worth the ride.There’s a common conjecture about Citrus saying that it treats sexual assault as a form of love and the blossoming romance is in the form of Stockholm syndrome, neither of which are true in the slightest. Firstly, while the actions of Mei Aihara undeniably walk on the borderline of sexual assault, none of these instances are framed as romantic or mutual in any way. The first of these depicts Yuzu struggling while Mei lashes out her aggression. Following this is a low shot with Mei, spitefully uttering “that’s what it felt like” in response to Yuzu’s innocent curiosity about Mei’s romantic affair. Nothing about this is painted in a positive, approving light. Subsequent events like this are blatantly shown to be a byproduct of Mei’s misconception of how relationships work, or a means to vent her frustration. The sheer discomfort is emphasized through both the cinematography and the expressions of the characters involved. This does not mean nefarious actions like these are excused, as the story never does. Yuzu always retaliates to these actions once she regains control over herself during these events. Depiction and endorsement are not the same thing, a fact that should always be considered with regards to a story like this. Another thing to address is this: the assaults are by no means the foundation of the leads’ romance, and that is a myth that should have passed long after this show had aired. Yuzu develops feelings for Mei long before the first assault occurs, which is most evident during the scene where she is lost in thought about witnessing Mei being kissed by Amamiya. Her focus is squarely on Mei’s behavior and what kissing must feel like for her, with Yuzu’s own attraction to Mei not even apparent to her. Overall, when proper attention is brought to the characters’ actions as well as the framing, it becomes clear that the criticism of Citrus romanticizing assault holds no truth whatsoever. I\'d like to make a point here that not all opinions are equal, and opinions on Citrus based on the conception that it romanticizes or normalizes assault and abuse are invalid and therefore wrong. A valid opinion doesn\'t require high intelligence or sophisticated taste or anything like that. It requires a correct interpretation of the content, one that is often not taken through first impressions or face value.Citrus and its content is highly reliant on context and characterization. Just as these confused adolescents struggle to understand each other and themselves, wondering who and what to believe, viewers are left on their own to base judgement on characters’ behavior and what they say, save for some frequent monologuing by Yuzu. And even then, her own thoughts aren’t always reliable. Content that comes off as questionable or discomforting to certain viewers is perfectly explainable through indirect characterization, a method of storytelling that challenges the brain beyond just relying on narration and monologues to provide answers without viewer effort. Viewers share frustration and confusion with the characters themselves, and the payoff is all the more rewarding because of this. The character Mei Aihara exemplifies this most of all, as she is a person whose subtle mannerisms bring light to a personality misshapen by the worst of circumstances, and very applicable to reality.Mei is a character with practically no conception of right and wrong, let alone the idea of consent, and has never been shown, or had any experience of, what a true romantic relationship is like. The only proper relationship she has ever had in life was with her father. After he left, Mei felt as if she was being abandoned by the only one she was ever truly close to. It’s clear that prior to where the main story begins, Mei has had no emotional support ever since her father’s absence. She is used and neglected by her grandfather, is constantly taken advantage of by her fiancée, and is under perpetual social pressure to follow her duties accordingly for days on end.As a result, Mei’s attitude towards romantic and sexual relationships is completely distorted. Her one and only understanding of love relationships is through physical contact, of which she uses to control people just as she has been controlled herself. This is symptomatic of being in a sexually abusive relationship like she had with her first fiancée; she doesn’t value her own body and is incapable of interacting with people normally. In many situations, whether it\'s a love relationship or otherwise, Mei passively accepts everything that is piled on her with no concern for her own well being, a trait that is consistently apparent over the course of the story. On the other end, her way of taking control of situations is her sexual advances towards Yuzu, who understandably objects to these actions. The main point is that Mei only acts in the way she knows how. This conflict of hers isn’t a singular matter, but numerous elements about her past and how she was raised which come together creating the version of Mei we see throughout the story. Mei is depraved, misguided, and some could even say mentally ill. And again, none of these elements are used to justify Mei\'s behavior. It\'s merely a case of cause and effect, one which leaves morality out of the question entirely.Being so used to her strict upbringing, Mei frames every scenario as a bargain or exchange rather than a desire, even if she doesn\'t necessarily intend it. Her feeling obligated to follow in the footsteps of her father to gain his affection encapsulates this quite well. Having received no unconditional love since her father’s disappearance, this is the way of thinking which governs almost all of the decisions she makes. For this reason, she’s perplexed as to why Yuzu bothers to do all these unconditional favors. The answer to this is simple: Yuzu cares about Mei. Unconditional love is a foreign concept to Mei, and this trait continues to subconsciously affect her even long after she has experienced the true virtues of a genuine human relationship. (*cue the beginning of episode 10*)The psychology of Mei is one of the main things which the story lives through, and is one of Citrus\' most fascinating aspects. As frustrating as her actions can be at times, the consistency of her character and the relatability of her plight makes her highly sympathetic, and as such Yuzu’s efforts to make things right for her, however reckless and brash, are very admirable. When you consider everything I\'ve previously stated, it turns out that Mei has every reason to act and behave the way she does. Her attitude and behavior are both realistic and morbidly consistent when acknowledging this perpetual turmoil she lives through.Mei’s problematic, manipulative behavior is not only addressed as such, but is also a conflict in itself. Discomforting scenes that people insist to be mere sleaze and titillation always leaves a negative effect on characters involved. Mei’s first assault turned Yuzu’s pending lust for and curiosity of Mei into a maelstrom of confusion and hysteria. Repetition of these acts behind the scenes gave us Mei Aihara as we know her. A certain character who does this to another results in the victim avoiding that character extensively.The way Mei gradually becomes more open to Yuzu about her feelings and personal issues, is a cathartic and satisfying affair in and of itself, and it’s kept at natural pace throughout. Not only this, her behavior changes for the better the longer she spends time with Yuzu. Little by little she displays improvement and development as she makes decisions of her own, acting beyond her mental protocol. It’s rather easy to see why Yuzu is in love with Mei, besides her beauty and status. Hiding behind this cold exterior is a frightened and lonely young girl that Yuzu wishes to nurture and protect.What’s truly commendable, however, is how many instances of her development are deliberately presented for us to infer on our own, rather than being told directly and explicitly. Here’s one particular example of this:**SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 7 AND 8 BEGIN HERE**..The moment Mei truly develops romantic feelings for Yuzu is at the end of episode 6, and the exact moment she realizes these feelings is episode 7 when Matsuri forcibly kisses Yuzu out in the open. This is all indicated through her sudden change in behavior compared to before. She is now less grim in her expressions around Yuzu, and looks slightly more sentimental. Her actions convey this even further, such as the way she compliments Yuzu for the meal that was made. The day after that, Matsuri is shown to be envious of Mei continually deriving attention from Yuzu at the expense of Matsuri’s, causing her to shove off. This causes Mei to feel guilty, having created distance between Yuzu and one of her closest friends. This is where she first experiences the baggage that comes from being in love...**SPOILERS END HERE**The reason this works in service to the narrative is so viewers are put into the perspective of Yuzu herself. She struggles to understand Mei, using signs in her behavior to understand what she feels. Mei is deliberately presented just as enigmatically as she is to everyone else.With so much about Mei already covered, it’s only fair that the other heroine, Yuzu, is given the same treatment. Yuzu at the start has an idealistic view of the life that lies before her. She acts with unrelenting confidence in almost all occasions, expecting everything to go smoothly and perfectly in line with what she envisions. I think I speak for most people when I say that when we were young teenagers, our ways of thinking were hardly any different. We’ve had strong ambitions of our own, believing we could achieve them all without entirely knowing the reality of certain situations. Of course, like most teenagers, the decisions that Yuzu makes are not always wise. Quite rarely so, in fact. She often does things, with or without good intentions, unperturbed by any potential consequences they could raise. Her greeting with the chairman is a particularly good example of this. Having become a new addition to his family, she approaches him expecting to be welcomed with open arms. Instead she’s scolded for her meddlesome behavior and unruly fashion choices.On the flipside, while she makes unwise decisions, Yuzu is not completely unintelligent. She shows a degree of rational thinking alongside her impulsive behavior, which is an important distinction from a character who is near hopeless in their stupidity. Yuzu eventually does mature past her idealism yet retains an optimistic outlook which drives her to do better in her more realistic pursuits. Yuzu is shown throughout the story to be a very capable individual thrusted into situations she’s unprepared for, often falling back to impulses or superficial goals. Despite this, she’s quick to bounce back and make things right through the best of her abilities, learning from past mistakes and focusing on what matters most in the long run.One of Yuzu’s strongest and most prominent traits is how empathetic she is. While she’s often self-absorbed in her appearance and overall image, she’s quick to understand others and wants to be on good terms with those around her. She’s the type of friend who would listen to your problems, forgive you for whatever quarrel you had with her, and be willing to keep any reasonable promise you ask of her. Amidst a locale of people’s misdeeds and the oppressive dominion that is her school, Yuzu is someone who is incredibly easy to root for and would be an overall great person to hang out with. It’s easy to see why Harumin became friends with her so quickly, and also why Mei eventually fell for her.While Yuzu is a highly good-hearted individual, to say she’s only ever kind and generous sells her personality woefully short. She can be irritable, snarky, jealous, and is overall more insecure than she lets on, using Harumin as an emotional crutch when she finds herself in a quandary. She often lets these emotions get the better of her, as teens typically do. The bubbly, boisterous personality of Yuzu, while oftentimes funny and endearing, can also come off as irksome and frustrating. Rather than being portrayed as an all-loving angel, Yuzu is a lovably flawed individual with a good heart and poor self-control. Compiling all these traits together results in one of the most compelling, lovable, sympathetic, and relatable main leads I’ve come across in all media.As for her relationship with Mei, Yuzu is on a constant struggle to comprehend her feelings. She knows that something is amiss about Mei, invoking a feeling of concern. At other times, she wonders if what she does hurts Mei more than it helps. This confusion is a result of their inability to communicate with each other effectively and coherently, mimicking typical romance between teenagers more than people seem to realize. Yuzu doesn’t understand Mei, and by extension doesn’t know how to act around her. The two of them had been raised in completely different conditions, and thus operate and communicate differently from one another.It’s obvious that Yuzu has an unfaltering love for Mei, but one obstacle she must overcome is resisting the urge to give in to her superficial desires, and pursuing what is realistically best for Mei in the long run. At one point her only choice is to put her love for Mei aside and to treat her as a sister. Although she does all these things selflessly she still has a degree of self-preservation, in stark contrast to Mei. What Citrus does well is distinguishing the superficial aspects of love from the emotional aspects. Crushes aren’t developed through logic, and our own real life experiences prove as much. What this series explores is the multitude of consequences that come with loving someone. In this case, it’s dealing with the complications of being in a love relationship with your step-sister.Differentiating perceptions of love are what pervade a majority of the cast in Citrus. The students at Aihara Academy all knowingly grew up in an environment where sexual experimentation is a normality. Of course I can’t speak from experience, but to my knowledge this mimics reality in Japan. Referred to as Class S, it’s common for girls in school to have crushes on other female classmates, forming bonds with them. These bonds could be described as romantic, but the sexual aspect of the attraction is out of the equation entirely, assuming they’re straight. It’s telling that a Japanese audience would have a far better understanding of this kind of story, and the positive reception of Citrus in Japan compared to the west is evidence of this.Harumin really emulates this concept more than the others. She is essentially a direct foil to Yuzu in how sexual relationships are perceived. For Harumin, particular actions between couples are a source of curiosity. By contrast, Yuzu thinks about what these actions mean for the relationship. The most obvious example is arguably when the two eavesdrop on Amamiya’s phone call. However, one other particular moment drives this home more than any other. Harumin discovers the yuri incest manga Yuzu was reading. Fascinated, she puts herself in a scissoring position with Yuzu. She’s so confident in her heterosexuality that doing this means nothing to her. Yuzu on the other hand recognizes this as an expression of love, and thus is highly discomforted by this scenario. This is largely presented as a comedy moment, but it does a lot to signify the differences in their characterization. It also benefits in a way from being depicted in such an over-the-top manner.Harumin acts as a companion to Yuzu all the way through to the end, but in reality she isn’t able to truly understand what Yuzu is going through, regardless of how much she thinks she does. This is also the reason Yuzu decides to take on these tasks by herself, because she’s the only one who truly understands. We can also assume that she keeps it to herself in fear that Harumin wouldn’t accept her for being in such a taboo relationship. After all, this is why she keeps it a secret to Matsuri and anyone else outside the school campus.Moving on from the characters, I bear no hesitation saying that the plot of Citrus is undoubtedly its weakest aspect. Although the events it strings together can catch viewers off-guard, maintaining a dash of unpredictability in the whole adventure, it all too often relies on contrivances. Coincidences in fictional stories aren’t inherently a bad thing. The coincidental reveal of Mei as Yuzu’s new sister is rather far-fetched, but it\'s tolerable enough to leave investment unimpeded. However, the numerous contrivances beyond this point become harder and harder to swallow as they come by. The way that some situations are arbitrarily resolved through circumstance, rather than on behalf of a character, doesn’t do the plot much favors either.A widely-used, yet reasonable, complaint about Citrus is its continuous introduction of characters to move the plot along. The way I see it, this is at least as much a problem with the pacing than the actual inclusion of these characters. When these subplots are coupled with Yuzu and Mei’s progressing relationship, then focus becomes a problem here. Tone shifts are frequent and occasionally jarring as a result of having to constantly switch priorities. The interpersonal affairs between Yuzu and Mei are heartfelt and down to earth, whereas dramatic confrontations with outsiders are tense, frantic, and somewhat theatrical. When meaningful interaction between Yuzu and Mei is abruptly followed by these sideplots, that can challenge one’s ability to stay invested in either plot.However, while pacing and tone is certainly an issue here, to say that these subplots serve no purpose is untrue. Each story arc in Citrus presents a barrier in Mei’s psyche which is resolved with every passing conclusion. Every resolve is satisfying in its own right as it brings Mei further out of her shell whilst bringing her and Yuzu closer together. It’s apparent that new characters are introduced to fill a certain role in these affairs, but the focus on Yuzu and Mei is unrelenting and the characters serve their purpose quite well. To start with, Himeko ""Twindrills"" Momokino at first appears to be quite the villain, but she actually shares traits with both Yuzu and Mei, and even has strikingly similar motivations. Like Yuzu, she has an unfaltering love for Mei, arguably in a “romantic friendship” sort of way as opposed to sexual attraction, and goes to great lengths to claim her affection. Like Mei, she is both dedicated to her job and remarkably strict with school regulations. Her intentions are what make her a rival to Yuzu, and then later bring them to a resolve. They wish the best for Mei, but are oblivious to her true feelings. Matsuri is a character acting as a parallel to Mei. Only instead of closing herself off, she seeks attention. In the worst ways. Her rebellious nature and sinister antics make her a worthy addition to the cast. It’s not done just for the sake of it though. It’s a situation where Mei sees her own self and is willing to make amends for someone Yuzu is close to.The arc with the Tachibana sisters is considered by many to be the weakest arc in the series, and I am no exception. While it serves its purpose well and the payoff is rewarding, it isn’t put together nearly as well as the others. I think what it sets out to do doesn’t warrant new characters to be introduced into the middle of the whole dilemma where their intrusion can be seen as more frustrating than serviceable, especially when those characters lack depth. The situation between Mei and Yuzu at this point is already complicated as it is, so piling more characters on top of these complications is more of an annoyance than anything else. I think other less irritating methods would have served the function of this arc quite well without having to bring the sisters into the mix. It also doesn’t help that in this arc, conveniences pile up even more than in any other, even attempting to sidestep this with “fate” and “destiny.”As I said before though, the payoff is largely worth it in the end. It’s not necessarily a case where the abundant problems in this arc can be forgotten, but rather forgiven. This arc is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise great story overall.The dialogue of Citrus is also worth commenting on. It’s no Shakespearean writing, but it feels natural and works in service to whatever is going on. The characters’ lines are filled with personality and subtext which makes conversations feel alive. Characters are also quick to point out irony in another’s lines, making the exchanges even more human. Certain moments in dialogue are quite significant and memorable for how expressive they are and how it piles emotion into the situation. The scene where Mei and Yuzu are on a bench on a cold winter day is a good example.With all that said, I think it’s finally time to traverse into how Citrus fares in the audio/visual department. Regarding the visual front of the Citrus anime adaptation, it’s an overall solid effort, albeit with a moderate amount to be desired. Obviously it would be unreasonable to expect the level of quality in the manga’s art to be fully translated into a costly animated product, especially with a studio like Passione. To compensate for this, the adaptation uses character models that are simplified versions of the exquisitely drawn renditions in the manga, and does so successfully. These character models would’ve been a satisfactory page-to-screen translation if not for one caveat: one of the main things which I believe gave the manga so much of its charm and made it so appealing to many, was how expressive the characters are. Characters, especially Yuzu, would regularly emote and make different facial expressions for many situations. This also happens to the anime to some degree, but not frequently enough to where it captures the manga’s original charm. It’s much rarer in the anime for characters to deviate from their default expressions, making the experience somewhat more sterile. Perhaps this was to cut down on budget costs, or it was a design choice on behalf of the director. Whatever the case, it’s a compromise which I can only feel detracts from the viewing experience. Manga and anime are different mediums, so of course compromises should be expected. But various scenes only stood to lose by omitting so much of the vibrance the characters displayed. Even the many chibi moments in the manga wouldn’t need to be adapted, as simply varying the facial expressions of the characters would be enough. Anime-only viewers probably won’t see this as a huge problem, as it’s rarely a sheer detriment to the visuals (save for a few lamentable instances). Scenes between characters are delivered well and there is plenty of emotion to be found in the visuals. The problem is that the adaptation, by not harnessing the kind of quality seen in the manga, wastes its potential as an adaptation and as an animated product. As it stands, it could be a hell of a lot worse, but it also could have been a lot better.Additionally, the animation quality is a department that ranges between average to well above average. There are various moments where I was very impressed by the animation, such as certain comedy moments, intimate scenes, emotional engagements, and characters’ body language. But there are also a select few times where I was dumbfounded by just how low the quality could really get. Overall it’s a pretty decently animated show with some flukes here and there, and thankfully it can only improve with the BDs. One of the fronts I was most impressed by in this adaption was the soundtrack. It genuinely surprised me with how good the music was in this adaptation. Using a mixture of graceful orchestral performances with vivacious electronic beats, the music of Citrus is vibrant, diverse, and well-suited for the exuberant and bittersweet tones that the story delivers.What’s lacking most of all in the visuals is the background art, a case where access to technology seems to have expended a team’s creativity. Several shots will display setpieces with little to no detail or texturing. Perfect cuboids and stainless steel populate much of this world. This is most prevalent in Yuzu’s own house, with walls that are solid colors and doors looking less like wood and more like metal. The school grounds also display a disgustingly high amount of textureless objects, falling short of selling this environment as something that could exist in the real world. This is not even mentioning the many issues with lighting, of which environments are either evenly lit or disregard physics altogether. One shot in particular takes place under a night sky with a lamp post in the left, yet with shadows directly underneath every object. What’s frustrating is that this shot looks great in about every other aspect, from coloring to composition, and falls short of perfection thanks to the team not willing to amend such a simple yet glaring issue.This also extends to background characters, which often consist of CG models walking awkwardly and robotically. Once this is noticed, it’s impossible to ignore, and immersion struggles to stay in tact. All of this is the mark of a bare minimum effort on the part of Passione, and fans of the source material aren’t nearly as scrutinous of this as they damn well should be. Incompetent decisions like these are one of the main reasons we as anime fans are so desperate for ideal adaptations of the manga and novels we dearly love.Fortunately, the shoddy effort in the backgrounds is alleviated through great shot composition and luscious color directing, for which we have director Takeo Takahashi to thank. This is a director who excels at visual storytelling and framing, emphasizing certain moods when applicable. Climactic scenes are sold effectively through this as well as character animations which, as previously stated, are well-done when they really need to be. This adaptation of Citrus is overall very well-directed, save for the aforementioned faults in production which Takeo should have been more mindful of. In an ideal world, the production of Citrus would be on par with Hanasaku Iroha, a show that I hold as a high standard for animated melodrama. The end result here is not without its faults, but is a satisfactory effort all things considered.So that concludes my review of Citrus. The story at large is quite rough around the edges with its frequent use of coincidences. It’s also arguably flawed in how many things are framed as a formulaic routine. With a new girl continually intruding on the situation, it’s admittedly easy to feel some degree of frustration. The core story however, with the two main leads, remains very strong. Various facets of their character are explored well and brought to a satisfying resolve. That said, there are many loose ends in the story yet to be tied up, in which case I can only hope a second season will be made eventually to adapt the rest of the source material to complement the anime-viewing experience. All things considered, however, Citrus is a great anime overall. One of the things which motivated me to write this review was to address the criticisms this show had been receiving. If you have already seen this anime, and anything I’ve said gave you something to think about, then perhaps it deserves a second viewing. For a show so widely shunned as being a lesbian fanservice show, the story of Citrus is one that anyone, gay or straight, male or female, can relate to on any level. more drama. These premature assessments are commonly made when shows like this are perceived as simple fetish material, framed as horribly misplaced criticisms that leave Citrus in an undeservedly contemptuous light; as a guilty pleasure unworthy of further analysis or appraisal. Citrus is not mere fetish material, does not promote or romanticize sexual assault, and provides layered and well-developed characters whose actions are realistically influenced by both internal and external conflicts. A bittersweet feeling perpetuates as we follow naive teenagers consistently characterized as those who are lost and confused, behaving in ways that are less than ideal, but are hurdles along the way of a gripping and emotionally compelling tale that is certainly rough around the edges, but well worth the ride.There’s a common conjecture about Citrus saying that it treats sexual assault as a form of love and the blossoming romance is in the form of Stockholm syndrome, neither of which are true in the slightest. Firstly, while the actions of Mei Aihara undeniably walk on the borderline of sexual assault, none of these instances are framed as romantic or mutual in any way. The first of these depicts Yuzu struggling while Mei lashes out her aggression. Following this is a low shot with Mei, spitefully uttering “that’s what it felt like” in response to Yuzu’s innocent curiosity about Mei’s romantic affair. Nothing about this is painted in a positive, approving light. Subsequent events like this are blatantly shown to be a byproduct of Mei’s misconception of how relationships work, or a means to vent her frustration. The sheer discomfort is emphasized through both the cinematography and the expressions of the characters involved. This does not mean nefarious actions like these are excused, as the story never does. Yuzu always retaliates to these actions once she regains control over herself during these events. Depiction and endorsement are not the same thing, a fact that should always be considered with regards to a story like this. Another thing to address is this: the assaults are by no means the foundation of the leads’ romance, and that is a myth that should have passed long after this show had aired. Yuzu develops feelings for Mei long before the first assault occurs, which is most evident during the scene where she is lost in thought about witnessing Mei being kissed by Amamiya. Her focus is squarely on Mei’s behavior and what kissing must feel like for her, with Yuzu’s own attraction to Mei not even apparent to her. Overall, when proper attention is brought to the characters’ actions as well as the framing, it becomes clear that the criticism of Citrus romanticizing assault holds no truth whatsoever. I\'d like to make a point here that not all opinions are equal, and opinions on Citrus based on the conception that it romanticizes or normalizes assault and abuse are invalid and therefore wrong. A valid opinion doesn\'t require high intelligence or sophisticated taste or anything like that. It requires a correct interpretation of the content, one that is often not taken through first impressions or face value.Citrus and its content is highly reliant on context and characterization. Just as these confused adolescents struggle to understand each other and themselves, wondering who and what to believe, viewers are left on their own to base judgement on characters’ behavior and what they say, save for some frequent monologuing by Yuzu. And even then, her own thoughts aren’t always reliable. Content that comes off as questionable or discomforting to certain viewers is perfectly explainable through indirect characterization, a method of storytelling that challenges the brain beyond just relying on narration and monologues to provide answers without viewer effort. Viewers share frustration and confusion with the characters themselves, and the payoff is all the more rewarding because of this. The character Mei Aihara exemplifies this most of all, as she is a person whose subtle mannerisms bring light to a personality misshapen by the worst of circumstances, and very applicable to reality.Mei is a character with practically no conception of right and wrong, let alone the idea of consent, and has never been shown, or had any experience of, what a true romantic relationship is like. The only proper relationship she has ever had in life was with her father. After he left, Mei felt as if she was being abandoned by the only one she was ever truly close to. It’s clear that prior to where the main story begins, Mei has had no emotional support ever since her father’s absence. She is used and neglected by her grandfather, is constantly taken advantage of by her fiancée, and is under perpetual social pressure to follow her duties accordingly for days on end.As a result, Mei’s attitude towards romantic and sexual relationships is completely distorted. Her one and only understanding of love relationships is through physical contact, of which she uses to control people just as she has been controlled herself. This is symptomatic of being in a sexually abusive relationship like she had with her first fiancée; she doesn’t value her own body and is incapable of interacting with people normally. In many situations, whether it\'s a love relationship or otherwise, Mei passively accepts everything that is piled on her with no concern for her own well being, a trait that is consistently apparent over the course of the story. On the other end, her way of taking control of situations is her sexual advances towards Yuzu, who understandably objects to these actions. The main point is that Mei only acts in the way she knows how. This conflict of hers isn’t a singular matter, but numerous elements about her past and how she was raised which come together creating the version of Mei we see throughout the story. Mei is depraved, misguided, and some could even say mentally ill. And again, none of these elements are used to justify Mei\'s behavior. It\'s merely a case of cause and effect, one which leaves morality out of the question entirely.Being so used to her strict upbringing, Mei frames every scenario as a bargain or exchange rather than a desire, even if she doesn\'t necessarily intend it. Her feeling obligated to follow in the footsteps of her father to gain his affection encapsulates this quite well. Having received no unconditional love since her father’s disappearance, this is the way of thinking which governs almost all of the decisions she makes. For this reason, she’s perplexed as to why Yuzu bothers to do all these unconditional favors. The answer to this is simple: Yuzu cares about Mei. Unconditional love is a foreign concept to Mei, and this trait continues to subconsciously affect her even long after she has experienced the true virtues of a genuine human relationship. (*cue the beginning of episode 10*)The psychology of Mei is one of the main things which the story lives through, and is one of Citrus\' most fascinating aspects. As frustrating as her actions can be at times, the consistency of her character and the relatability of her plight makes her highly sympathetic, and as such Yuzu’s efforts to make things right for her, however reckless and brash, are very admirable. When you consider everything I\'ve previously stated, it turns out that Mei has every reason to act and behave the way she does. Her attitude and behavior are both realistic and morbidly consistent when acknowledging this perpetual turmoil she lives through.Mei’s problematic, manipulative behavior is not only addressed as such, but is also a conflict in itself. Discomforting scenes that people insist to be mere sleaze and titillation always leaves a negative effect on characters involved. Mei’s first assault turned Yuzu’s pending lust for and curiosity of Mei into a maelstrom of confusion and hysteria. Repetition of these acts behind the scenes gave us Mei Aihara as we know her. A certain character who does this to another results in the victim avoiding that character extensively.The way Mei gradually becomes more open to Yuzu about her feelings and personal issues, is a cathartic and satisfying affair in and of itself, and it’s kept at natural pace throughout. Not only this, her behavior changes for the better the longer she spends time with Yuzu. Little by little she displays improvement and development as she makes decisions of her own, acting beyond her mental protocol. It’s rather easy to see why Yuzu is in love with Mei, besides her beauty and status. Hiding behind this cold exterior is a frightened and lonely young girl that Yuzu wishes to nurture and protect.What’s truly commendable, however, is how many instances of her development are deliberately presented for us to infer on our own, rather than being told directly and explicitly. Here’s one particular example of this:**SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 7 AND 8 BEGIN HERE**..The moment Mei truly develops romantic feelings for Yuzu is at the end of episode 6, and the exact moment she realizes these feelings is episode 7 when Matsuri forcibly kisses Yuzu out in the open. This is all indicated through her sudden change in behavior compared to before. She is now less grim in her expressions around Yuzu, and looks slightly more sentimental. Her actions convey this even further, such as the way she compliments Yuzu for the meal that was made. The day after that, Matsuri is shown to be envious of Mei continually deriving attention from Yuzu at the expense of Matsuri’s, causing her to shove off. This causes Mei to feel guilty, having created distance between Yuzu and one of her closest friends. This is where she first experiences the baggage that comes from being in love...**SPOILERS END HERE**The reason this works in service to the narrative is so viewers are put into the perspective of Yuzu herself. She struggles to understand Mei, using signs in her behavior to understand what she feels. Mei is deliberately presented just as enigmatically as she is to everyone else.With so much about Mei already covered, it’s only fair that the other heroine, Yuzu, is given the same treatment. Yuzu at the start has an idealistic view of the life that lies before her. She acts with unrelenting confidence in almost all occasions, expecting everything to go smoothly and perfectly in line with what she envisions. I think I speak for most people when I say that when we were young teenagers, our ways of thinking were hardly any different. We’ve had strong ambitions of our own, believing we could achieve them all without entirely knowing the reality of certain situations. Of course, like most teenagers, the decisions that Yuzu makes are not always wise. Quite rarely so, in fact. She often does things, with or without good intentions, unperturbed by any potential consequences they could raise. Her greeting with the chairman is a particularly good example of this. Having become a new addition to his family, she approaches him expecting to be welcomed with open arms. Instead she’s scolded for her meddlesome behavior and unruly fashion choices.On the flipside, while she makes unwise decisions, Yuzu is not completely unintelligent. She shows a degree of rational thinking alongside her impulsive behavior, which is an important distinction from a character who is near hopeless in their stupidity. Yuzu eventually does mature past her idealism yet retains an optimistic outlook which drives her to do better in her more realistic pursuits. Yuzu is shown throughout the story to be a very capable individual thrusted into situations she’s unprepared for, often falling back to impulses or superficial goals. Despite this, she’s quick to bounce back and make things right through the best of her abilities, learning from past mistakes and focusing on what matters most in the long run.One of Yuzu’s strongest and most prominent traits is how empathetic she is. While she’s often self-absorbed in her appearance and overall image, she’s quick to understand others and wants to be on good terms with those around her. She’s the type of friend who would listen to your problems, forgive you for whatever quarrel you had with her, and be willing to keep any reasonable promise you ask of her. Amidst a locale of people’s misdeeds and the oppressive dominion that is her school, Yuzu is someone who is incredibly easy to root for and would be an overall great person to hang out with. It’s easy to see why Harumin became friends with her so quickly, and also why Mei eventually fell for her.While Yuzu is a highly good-hearted individual, to say she’s only ever kind and generous sells her personality woefully short. She can be irritable, snarky, jealous, and is overall more insecure than she lets on, using Harumin as an emotional crutch when she finds herself in a quandary. She often lets these emotions get the better of her, as teens typically do. The bubbly, boisterous personality of Yuzu, while oftentimes funny and endearing, can also come off as irksome and frustrating. Rather than being portrayed as an all-loving angel, Yuzu is a lovably flawed individual with a good heart and poor self-control. Compiling all these traits together results in one of the most compelling, lovable, sympathetic, and relatable main leads I’ve come across in all media.As for her relationship with Mei, Yuzu is on a constant struggle to comprehend her feelings. She knows that something is amiss about Mei, invoking a feeling of concern. At other times, she wonders if what she does hurts Mei more than it helps. This confusion is a result of their inability to communicate with each other effectively and coherently, mimicking typical romance between teenagers more than people seem to realize. Yuzu doesn’t understand Mei, and by extension doesn’t know how to act around her. The two of them had been raised in completely different conditions, and thus operate and communicate differently from one another.It’s obvious that Yuzu has an unfaltering love for Mei, but one obstacle she must overcome is resisting the urge to give in to her superficial desires, and pursuing what is realistically best for Mei in the long run. At one point her only choice is to put her love for Mei aside and to treat her as a sister. Although she does all these things selflessly she still has a degree of self-preservation, in stark contrast to Mei. What Citrus does well is distinguishing the superficial aspects of love from the emotional aspects. Crushes aren’t developed through logic, and our own real life experiences prove as much. What this series explores is the multitude of consequences that come with loving someone. In this case, it’s dealing with the complications of being in a love relationship with your step-sister.Differentiating perceptions of love are what pervade a majority of the cast in Citrus. The students at Aihara Academy all knowingly grew up in an environment where sexual experimentation is a normality. Of course I can’t speak from experience, but to my knowledge this mimics reality in Japan. Referred to as Class S, it’s common for girls in school to have crushes on other female classmates, forming bonds with them. These bonds could be described as romantic, but the sexual aspect of the attraction is out of the equation entirely, assuming they’re straight. It’s telling that a Japanese audience would have a far better understanding of this kind of story, and the positive reception of Citrus in Japan compared to the west is evidence of this.Harumin really emulates this concept more than the others. She is essentially a direct foil to Yuzu in how sexual relationships are perceived. For Harumin, particular actions between couples are a source of curiosity. By contrast, Yuzu thinks about what these actions mean for the relationship. The most obvious example is arguably when the two eavesdrop on Amamiya’s phone call. However, one other particular moment drives this home more than any other. Harumin discovers the yuri incest manga Yuzu was reading. Fascinated, she puts herself in a scissoring position with Yuzu. She’s so confident in her heterosexuality that doing this means nothing to her. Yuzu on the other hand recognizes this as an expression of love, and thus is highly discomforted by this scenario. This is largely presented as a comedy moment, but it does a lot to signify the differences in their characterization. It also benefits in a way from being depicted in such an over-the-top manner.Harumin acts as a companion to Yuzu all the way through to the end, but in reality she isn’t able to truly understand what Yuzu is going through, regardless of how much she thinks she does. This is also the reason Yuzu decides to take on these tasks by herself, because she’s the only one who truly understands. We can also assume that she keeps it to herself in fear that Harumin wouldn’t accept her for being in such a taboo relationship. After all, this is why she keeps it a secret to Matsuri and anyone else outside the school campus.Moving on from the characters, I bear no hesitation saying that the plot of Citrus is undoubtedly its weakest aspect. Although the events it strings together can catch viewers off-guard, maintaining a dash of unpredictability in the whole adventure, it all too often relies on contrivances. Coincidences in fictional stories aren’t inherently a bad thing. The coincidental reveal of Mei as Yuzu’s new sister is rather far-fetched, but it\'s tolerable enough to leave investment unimpeded. However, the numerous contrivances beyond this point become harder and harder to swallow as they come by. The way that some situations are arbitrarily resolved through circumstance, rather than on behalf of a character, doesn’t do the plot much favors either.A widely-used, yet reasonable, complaint about Citrus is its continuous introduction of characters to move the plot along. The way I see it, this is at least as much a problem with the pacing than the actual inclusion of these characters. When these subplots are coupled with Yuzu and Mei’s progressing relationship, then focus becomes a problem here. Tone shifts are frequent and occasionally jarring as a result of having to constantly switch priorities. The interpersonal affairs between Yuzu and Mei are heartfelt and down to earth, whereas dramatic confrontations with outsiders are tense, frantic, and somewhat theatrical. When meaningful interaction between Yuzu and Mei is abruptly followed by these sideplots, that can challenge one’s ability to stay invested in either plot.However, while pacing and tone is certainly an issue here, to say that these subplots serve no purpose is untrue. Each story arc in Citrus presents a barrier in Mei’s psyche which is resolved with every passing conclusion. Every resolve is satisfying in its own right as it brings Mei further out of her shell whilst bringing her and Yuzu closer together. It’s apparent that new characters are introduced to fill a certain role in these affairs, but the focus on Yuzu and Mei is unrelenting and the characters serve their purpose quite well. To start with, Himeko ""Twindrills"" Momokino at first appears to be quite the villain, but she actually shares traits with both Yuzu and Mei, and even has strikingly similar motivations. Like Yuzu, she has an unfaltering love for Mei, arguably in a “romantic friendship” sort of way as opposed to sexual attraction, and goes to great lengths to claim her affection. Like Mei, she is both dedicated to her job and remarkably strict with school regulations. Her intentions are what make her a rival to Yuzu, and then later bring them to a resolve. They wish the best for Mei, but are oblivious to her true feelings. Matsuri is a character acting as a parallel to Mei. Only instead of closing herself off, she seeks attention. In the worst ways. Her rebellious nature and sinister antics make her a worthy addition to the cast. It’s not done just for the sake of it though. It’s a situation where Mei sees her own self and is willing to make amends for someone Yuzu is close to.The arc with the Tachibana sisters is considered by many to be the weakest arc in the series, and I am no exception. While it serves its purpose well and the payoff is rewarding, it isn’t put together nearly as well as the others. I think what it sets out to do doesn’t warrant new characters to be introduced into the middle of the whole dilemma where their intrusion can be seen as more frustrating than serviceable, especially when those characters lack depth. The situation between Mei and Yuzu at this point is already complicated as it is, so piling more characters on top of these complications is more of an annoyance than anything else. I think other less irritating methods would have served the function of this arc quite well without having to bring the sisters into the mix. It also doesn’t help that in this arc, conveniences pile up even more than in any other, even attempting to sidestep this with “fate” and “destiny.”As I said before though, the payoff is largely worth it in the end. It’s not necessarily a case where the abundant problems in this arc can be forgotten, but rather forgiven. This arc is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise great story overall.The dialogue of Citrus is also worth commenting on. It’s no Shakespearean writing, but it feels natural and works in service to whatever is going on. The characters’ lines are filled with personality and subtext which makes conversations feel alive. Characters are also quick to point out irony in another’s lines, making the exchanges even more human. Certain moments in dialogue are quite significant and memorable for how expressive they are and how it piles emotion into the situation. The scene where Mei and Yuzu are on a bench on a cold winter day is a good example.With all that said, I think it’s finally time to traverse into how Citrus fares in the audio/visual department. Regarding the visual front of the Citrus anime adaptation, it’s an overall solid effort, albeit with a moderate amount to be desired.

Celebrities\' misdeeds are being exposed publicly on a weekly basis like a new sporting event. The #MeToo movement giving a platform to voice sex scandals that have gone unnoticed for far too long. Scrolling through your timeline, plastered on the TV screen, announced over the radio during daily commutes, the subject matter of countless memes, the focal point of water-cooler conversations; no matter where you turn, there it is. Accusation after accusation. Transforming popular figures into pervert pariahs overnight. Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Bill Cosby, Louis C.K., Dustin Hoffman, Brett Ratner, James Woods, Bryan Singer, Casey...Affleck; an endless potpourri of bigwigs—the 21st Century witch hunt in full swing. No one is safe.And while all of this is going on, halfway across the globe, there\'s Citrus, minding its own business as it idly trolls along turning sexual assault into a provocative byproduct of step-sisters ""bickering."" While people are pooling together with torches and pitchforks in hand, shining a light on any sexual misconduct occurring in the dark recesses of the entertainment industry, Studio Passione persists with the biggest ""whatever bro"" shoulder shrug. What the rest of the world concerns itself with isn\'t going to stop them from showing girls casually molesting each other on their scheduled programming. It\'s actually pretty impressive. Fucked up, but impressive nonetheless. I guess you could extend that sentiment to Japan in general.

It\'s the kind of eroticism that arrives quickly and leaves you feeling dirty.An anime that will have a heated shower scene where non-consensual groping occurs, then follow it up with this dialogue exchange:""No!""–Yuzu pushes away in abject horror– ""Why are you doing this!?""–her eyes closed, as she stands there naked and vulnerable.Mei innocently answers back without hesitation, a tone of motherly matter-of-factness:""Because you looked like you wanted me to touch you.""The scene ends, never to properly address the disturbing exchange again.As long as the money shot was secured and a few man-tents were pitched, nothing else matters.This is the kind of ""feeling dirty"" I\'m referring to.I love perverted content as much as the next guy, but sometimes, what Citrus attempts to do is genuinely off-putting. Sexual harassment shouldn\'t be confused with love. And if it is, a level of accountability needs to be put in place to avoid idealistic handwaving. But this is a show that thinks that if it holds a ""this is wrong"" PSA after it indulges in sexual misconduct, that it\'s suddenly not culpable of wrongdoing. An anime that sells Stockholm syndrome as a shot of Cupid\'s arrow. Where fighting sexual harassment with sexual harassment is treated as an actual solution. Serious issues trivialized to create marketable eroticism and comedic gags.Any act of earnestness is completely lost in a title devoid of finesse. After a while, you sort of just roll with it.

You might even buy into the lack of audiovisual effort as a part of the ""theme"" to contrast everything against Yuzu\'s personality. Of course, you\'ll be wrong, as even her living quarters and look has been rendered flaccid, lacking in any sense of creative vitality or noticeable effort. It\'s all very surface-level. Pedestrian sleaze that isn\'t arousing enough to keep the Kleenex nearby nor respectful enough to genuinely stimulate discussions regarding the content on display.And that\'s perhaps this show\'s biggest downfall in a nutshell: it\'s vanilla, but a souring type of vanilla.A type of middling existence occupied by works of far more distinction than itself.

There are better alternatives out there for those actually seeking integrity (Koi Kaze) or far more titillating eye-candy (Scum\'s Wish). Why settle for vanilla in a world full of flavor just waiting to be discovered? Is Citrus entertaining? Sure, at times. But when 17-minutes of content is glazed over just for 3-minutes of ""sexy-time,"" and the ""sexy-time"" itself is neither well-animated or concerned with addressing the elephant in the room that surrounds its content; at that point, what you\'re left with is a show whose sole purpose for existing is left dead in the water from the moment it dives in. Affleck; an endless potpourri of bigwigs—the 21st Century witch hunt in full swing. No one is safe.And while all of this is going on, halfway across the globe, there\'s Citrus, minding its own business as it idly trolls along turning sexual assault into a provocative byproduct of step-sisters ""bickering."" While people are pooling together with torches and pitchforks in hand, shining a light on any sexual misconduct occurring in the dark recesses of the entertainment industry, Studio Passione persists with the biggest ""whatever bro"" shoulder shrug. What the rest of the world concerns itself with isn\'t going to stop them from showing girls casually molesting each other on their scheduled programming. It\'s actually pretty impressive. Fucked up, but impressive nonetheless. I guess you could extend that sentiment to Japan in general.

However, when they become aware of some social taboos, they change their mind and create a disapproval towards some topics. One example, the lesbian romance. Citrus has potential but fails with some distasteful scenes as described below.The Ugly: The story mistake love with rape and forces affection from a lame sexual assault. In this world, Weinstein’s behavior would be considered romantic and not the act of a sick predator.The Good: As the plot progress you can observe the protagonists’ insecurity, problems, and feelings.The Bad: Unrealistic begin. Some characters are not well developed because the time...is not enough to let them grow.Citrus introduces a homosexual storyline where we can see a lesbian nexus, yet you don’t need to fear it. No matter your gender, you can enjoy some parts of the narrative. The plot isn’t as bad as some writers want us to believe, but it’s not surprising either. Besides, the series begins with some weird and awkward moments that sink the possibility of a good romance, and I consider them fictional and unrealistic. On the other hand, Citrus emphasize the inexperience and the doubts in a relationship and tries to establish a link between the protagonists. In some scenes, you can sense the character’s feelings. Sadly, in this modern era the taboo persists, perhaps for a woman, it is easier to tolerate this type of bond. Finally, Citrus is a Yuri anime, if you cannot bear this kind of affinity, it is better to stand aside and ignore the adaptation, or you might end up disappointed.The storyThe story isn’t as marvelous as you can expect, the author sometimes mistakes rape with love, though. Also, the only way explored to conceive the romance is through the physical force. For example, it is ridiculous comparing intimacy with a sexual assault under the diplomatic motto “since I love you, I can obligate you to adore me.” In a real world, this concept will be judged as rude and out of place, it will generate repulsion, a restriction order and could end with a visit to the jail. Those actions could lead the spectator to misinterpret the characters’ feelings and leaves the personal problems, fears, doubts, the lack of experience, and psychological aspects in the missing objects box. In the case of Yuzu, she does not know how to approach Mei, so the storyteller merely throws her over Mei literally, and the latter doesn’t hesitate to assault Yuzu. Can you accept it as a romance? Furthermore, this keeps happening during all the adaptation. If you read the manga, those scenes aren’t intrusive, you can pass them faster but in the anime the director focus and prolong them. Call it fanservice, hentai or sexual harassment; it does not fit the feeling setting momentum.In addition, this erroneous idea creates a false meaning of a lesbian link. From my perspective, a lesbian is like a straight; the relationship rules are alike. Why does the author use a weird and a wrong approach to initiate the attraction? Thus far, the plot fails on producing a good start for the romantic connection, it just leads the characters to a forced rape, deceiving the spectators with a cheap and fake drama.Nevertheless, the narration improves as it advances. I am not considering Citrus as a masterpiece, but the progression is acceptable. As the series continues, we can observe the inexperience of a usual acquaintance, the doubts, the pain, the suffering of the protagonists delivering the audience a better development and a different perspective. While the story picks up, it still has some defects such as the recurrent fanservice. If the social taboos do not slant the viewer, you could enjoy Citrus, though.Unfortunately, the lack of sense at the beginning ruins the possibility of a more vibrant narrative, a palpable romance and leads to the audience’s boredom. Going further, you can notice some pacing problems. You need to be honest with yourself because some characters were just placed to fill a scene. The casual spectator will only watch the first episodes and decide if skipping the show. Since the issues appear from the start, Citrus will be readily considered a bit grotesque, a raw passion and a potential drop.Finally, the overused sexual assault as a “comedy” (for some) or as a “romance” change the plot and the enjoyment. If you can survive those scenes, you can see the character’s authentic feelings. Honestly, I like Citrus manga, but the anime has been highly criticized by some unpleasant development that leads to a different meaning. In conclusion, you cannot compare intimacy with ravishment, and you cannot exploit the sexual assault to propel a romantic or comedic moment. For some viewers that scenes show affection, for others is a rape. In my case, SOME are sexual abuse and unnecessary. Lastly, the twelve episodes present a portion of the story and not all the published material and the most significant parts of the series still on the source.The charactersYuzu.

As I said, Citrus isn’t for all the tastes.Lastly and talking in general, you need to be broad-minded and don’t bury a show just for a sexual preference. You can criticize but don’t stigmatize the lesbian topic. If you dislike the story, skip it.', 'If I got a dollar every time this show featured a kiss scene, I’d probably be filthy rich now. No, not really but you have to admit, there’s almost an absurd amount of kissing in this show known as “Citrus”. To me, this show is a modern example of a trashy soap opera made with the intention of cash grab.Adapted by the manga of the same name, Citrus is one of the few series in recent years that decided to take on the idea of lesbianism and turn it into a modern day drama. In anime form, it’s defined more as yuri/shoujo-ai. As someone...who has read parts of the manga, Citrus focuses on the concept of female relationships. Unfortunately, I can’t really express any hope after reading the manga. This anime adaptation set off red flags from the start and isn’t able to fix them. It’s a shame really.Diving into this show may feel a little uncomfortable at first if you’re not used to this type of genre. The first few episodes makes it clear that there’s more going on between main characters Yuzu and Mei. Although they don’t have similar personalities, it’s shown that Yuzu feels an uneasy attraction towards Mei after getting into some compromising positions with her. Throughout the show, the both of them engage in many activities that adheres to lesbianism. The anime doesn’t hide the fact that there’s seems to be mutual attraction as each episode ventures on. Other characters gets involved in their story but the main focus is on this pair. And to be honest, it feels pretty embarrassing to watch. The show tries to be a love story but instead filled with laughably bad dialogue and clichés. I also can’t remember the number of times I shook my head at how their relationship developed. That’s actually what holds the show back a lot. Relationship dynamics in Citrus dances with an immense amount of teenage feelings and attempts to make it seem complicated. However, it ends up being washed up with little value and doesn’t seem to know what to make of its characters.Individually, Yuzu and Mei aren’t actually bad characters. At least from a realistic point of view, Yuzu is a normal girl who wants to explore romance and grow up. She’s also a bit of a daredevil and isn’t afraid to speak her mind or help others when in need. On the other hand, there’s Mei with a personality as cold as the snow. My impression of Mei is someone who would be incredibly difficult to be friends with. Her values are high standard and she never seems to let people get close to her, with perhaps the exception of Yuzu. We also get some background story about the two characters in later episodes to make viewers understand them more. However, that’s pretty much the extent of it. Yuzu and Mei are basically carrying this show while other characters are hardly worth talking about. I mean, there’s Yuzu’s best friend Himeko but she gets annoying every time her mouth opens. Harumi Taniguchi’s borderline obsession with Mei is incredibly obnoxious to watch. Oh and who can forget about Matsuri? It seems the show tries to make the audience hate her as much as possible. The Tachibana sisters introduced in later episodes are hardly likable either with their oddball personalities. The point is, most of these characters are one dimensional and hardly develops. In fact, I would say the characterization in this show really shoots itself in the foot with how certain episodes conclude. And that’s too bad really.Besides the characters and story, it seems Citrus loves to service the fans. While it’s not as explicit as some scenes in the manga, there’s quite a bit of kissing in the show. If you fancy make out scenes and yuri fan service, then this might be the type of show for you. I’m not going to lie though, it can be a bit of guilty pleasure at times. However, it gets tedious fast and after you’ve seen it a dozen times, it almost feels senseless. That being said, Citrus does do what it’s intended to do: bring out teenage feelings from characters and making a trite soap opera out of it.If there’s one thing to smile upon Citrus, it would definitely be the visual quality. To put it simply, the show is vibrant, colorful, and is full of life. The character designs are attractive and really enhances the feminine charms of the cast such as Yuzu and the Tachibana sisters. The way characters expresses their emotions is also highlighted through the choreography that’s hard to ignore. In many ways, the technical quality of Citrus is a sight for eyes to feast on. Whether it’s the fan service or characters themselves, it’s definitely there to impress.There’s not too much to go on about soundtrack as both theme songs gets its point across with the teenage drama style performance. However, the character voice mannerism is what makes some of the characters feel consistent with their roles. Yuzu is the most prominent example as she often speaks her mind and has a voice to match with her personality. Mei has a much colder voice tone that reflects her reserved persona. However, there’s also other characters that I can hardly stand whenever they speak. In particular, Matsuri’s voice sounds like she’s a 12 year old. Get ready for the ear plugs…By the time I finished Citrus, I had to question myself why the anime is even called that. The literal definition of Citrus is a type of fruit that has somewhat of a sweet and bitter flavor. Does that stand as a personification of the show’s themes? Who knows but I honestly find this show more than just bittersweet. What could have been a chance to make monumental history turned into a sour experience. who has read parts of the manga, Citrus focuses on the concept of female relationships. Unfortunately, I can’t really express any hope after reading the manga. This anime adaptation set off red flags from the start and isn’t able to fix them. It’s a shame really.Diving into this show may feel a little uncomfortable at first if you’re not used to this type of genre. The first few episodes makes it clear that there’s more going on between main characters Yuzu and Mei. Although they don’t have similar personalities, it’s shown that Yuzu feels an uneasy attraction towards Mei after getting into some compromising positions with her. Throughout the show, the both of them engage in many activities that adheres to lesbianism. The anime doesn’t hide the fact that there’s seems to be mutual attraction as each episode ventures on. Other characters gets involved in their story but the main focus is on this pair. And to be honest, it feels pretty embarrassing to watch. The show tries to be a love story but instead filled with laughably bad dialogue and clichés. I also can’t remember the number of times I shook my head at how their relationship developed. That’s actually what holds the show back a lot. Relationship dynamics in Citrus dances with an immense amount of teenage feelings and attempts to make it seem complicated. However, it ends up being washed up with little value and doesn’t seem to know what to make of its characters.Individually, Yuzu and Mei aren’t actually bad characters. At least from a realistic point of view, Yuzu is a normal girl who wants to explore romance and grow up. She’s also a bit of a daredevil and isn’t afraid to speak her mind or help others when in need. On the other hand, there’s Mei with a personality as cold as the snow. My impression of Mei is someone who would be incredibly difficult to be friends with. Her values are high standard and she never seems to let people get close to her, with perhaps the exception of Yuzu. We also get some background story about the two characters in later episodes to make viewers understand them more. However, that’s pretty much the extent of it. Yuzu and Mei are basically carrying this show while other characters are hardly worth talking about. I mean, there’s Yuzu’s best friend Himeko but she gets annoying every time her mouth opens. Harumi Taniguchi’s borderline obsession with Mei is incredibly obnoxious to watch. Oh and who can forget about Matsuri? It seems the show tries to make the audience hate her as much as possible. The Tachibana sisters introduced in later episodes are hardly likable either with their oddball personalities. The point is, most of these characters are one dimensional and hardly develops. In fact, I would say the characterization in this show really shoots itself in the foot with how certain episodes conclude. And that’s too bad really.Besides the characters and story, it seems Citrus loves to service the fans. While it’s not as explicit as some scenes in the manga, there’s quite a bit of kissing in the show. If you fancy make out scenes and yuri fan service, then this might be the type of show for you. I’m not going to lie though, it can be a bit of guilty pleasure at times. However, it gets tedious fast and after you’ve seen it a dozen times, it almost feels senseless. That being said, Citrus does do what it’s intended to do: bring out teenage feelings from characters and making a trite soap opera out of it.If there’s one thing to smile upon Citrus, it would definitely be the visual quality. To put it simply, the show is vibrant, colorful, and is full of life. The character designs are attractive and really enhances the feminine charms of the cast such as Yuzu and the Tachibana sisters. The way characters expresses their emotions is also highlighted through the choreography that’s hard to ignore. In many ways, the technical quality of Citrus is a sight for eyes to feast on.

What could have been a chance to make monumental history turned into a sour experience.', 'Potential spoilers for the manga below...First - ignore all the hate directed at Citrus online. Give it a chance and make up your own mind. Other reviews and discussions will mock you for enjoying something they call trashy and melodramatic. They mock you for being entertained by something they have deemed so basic and depraved. And yet, after you\'ve watched a few episodes you\'re thinking, \'why do I like this so much and why do I want to see more if everyone says this is garbage?\'It\'s because Saburouta is punching WAY above her weight on Citrus. It\'s like someone took Jane Austen and plonked her...down in modern day Japan and asked her to write a yuri manga. Yes, the very thing that all those haters will mock you for seeing in Citrus that they claim doesn\'t actually exist - the excellent writing, the deep character development, the touching emotional content - really is there, and it\'s been written quite purposefully and skillfully.To begin, let\'s put aside that this is yuri for the moment. Yes, you know it is, I know it is, everyone knows it is. But the point of Citrus is absolutely not the fact that it\'s yuri. Saburouta could have written this story with two asexually reproducing spores as the main characters and it would have been equally as compelling. The fact that it\'s yuri is not implicitly fan-service, and if you\'ve read the manga you will know that Saburouta dishes out the fan service in such tiny servings as to lack any nourishment whatsoever. More on why this is an issue in a moment.Let\'s get the other elephant in the room out of the way - the non-consensual sexual content in the first episodes/manga issues. Remember that this is a work of fiction and the reader is not meant to condone or approve of the actions of any of the characters. This is the classic dramatic question of, ""is evil something you are or something you do?"" To begin with, Mei has been taken advantage of, used, and basically treated like an automaton by dear old gramps ever since her Dad left (we\'ll get to that later). At the beginning of the story, there is no Mei - there is just a robot that does what needs to be done in the name of the Aihara family. She has no mother, no father, and the only affection she has ever known has been the cruel affection of the jerk teacher that she was arranged to marry even though he was planning on leaving her once he had the academy. She has literally never had a proper emotional relationship with anyone, and all she understands is the use of physical affection as a means of controlling others, as she has been controlled herself. But yes, you say, Mei should know better. She should know the difference between right and wrong! Oh really? Who taught Mei right from wrong? That\'s right, no one! She\'s acting out the only way she knows how. And, by the end of episode nine after the run-in with Matsuri - shock of all shocks, Mei has learned right from wrong because never again in the entire series do we see Mei act this way. And guess who teaches Mei wrong from right by her actions - Yuzu does.I\'d also like to address the actions of Matsuri that a lot of people have a problem with - don\'t forget that Matsuri is just a kid. Remember being a kid? Remember how bad your judgement was, and how you did a lot of stupid things that people called you out for? Again, you say, Matsuri should know right from wrong. But again, who taught her right from wrong - her workaholic, absent parents? Right. Matsuri isn\'t capable of understanding the consequences of her actions, something that Yuzu points out to her several times. ""Relationships are not a game"" and ""love does not come as easily as it does in a manga"" says Yuzu to Matsuri. Matsuri is similar to Mei (as Mei informs her on the train, and why Mei forgives Matsuri so easily) in that Matsuri is literally a kid alone in the world. But instead of closing herself off to the rest of the world like Mei did, Matsuri sought out attention - the bad kind - online with her ""clients"". Mei isn\'t joking or being self-sacrificing when she tells Yuzu ""that girls needs you"". Mei understands more than anyone, despite Matsuri\'s actions, that Matsuri needs a source of goodness and love in her life. This is why Mei says that Yuzu is ""one of those meddlesome people who give you love even though you didn\'t ask for it"". By the end of episode nine, Matsuri has very subtly grown as a person and again, never does any of that bad stuff again for the rest of the series (so far).Let\'s get to the relationship between Yuzu and Mei. They are, quite literally and figuratively, the yin to the other\'s yang. And let\'s get one thing out of the way right now - Mei and Yuzu are as gay as the day is long from the outset. This is why I said this story could have been about two asexually reproducing spores - the fact that they are gay has nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing to do with this story. Why do I say this? Because neither Yuzu or Mei are struggling with their sexuality, ever. Being gay is so natural to them that they never question it. Need proof? Remember the scene where Yuzu is reading the sister manga, and Harumin (who wins as best friend in a manga/anime ever btw) suddenly scissors her. Yuzu *freaks out* and Harumin says ""this book shows positions for two women"". Why is Harumin so casual and Yuzu so freaked out? Because to Harumin, that position means literally nothing other than a curiousity - Harumin is so confident in her heterosexuality that she can do that without worrying what it means. Yuzu, on the other hand, is mortified because scissoring means something completely different to her - it means an expression of love, an expression of love she one days hopes to share with Mei. Which is what makes it such an uncomfortable situation with Harumin, for whom she has only a friendship type of love.And Mei, well, Mei is just super gay. And this is where Citrus is worth a deeper look and a rewatch or two. The thing you need to know about Mei is that she falls for Yuzu *for real* in episode eight. You know after Yuzu takes Mei to say goodbye to her father, Shou? After Mei sees Matsuri awkwardly kissing Yuzu in the street? Yeah - right there. That\'s where Mei falls for Yuzu. The cute little finger twidding scene with her stuffed bear followed by the passionate hug of Yuzu - right there. And here\'s where the central conflict of the series begins: Mei simultaneously loves Yuzu but also wants to push Yuzu away because of all the baggage that comes with loving Yuzu. Mei is pissed off with herself for being in love with Yuzu, and every interaction for the rest of the anime/manga is an expression of the internal love/hate that Mei has for Yuzu. This is what makes the story so bittersweet - we love Yuzu, Yuzu wants Mei to love her, Mei wants to love Yuzu, we want Mei to love Yuzu, but....Mei just can\'t allow herself to do that. If you\'ve ever been in a similar situation, you know what\'s up.But back to the gayness. Saburouta never asks us to question that they are gay, as is the case with most ""will they or won\'t they"" yuri - we are meant to accept it as easily as the both of them do. So Saburouta has taken the standard yuri trope and cast it aside.I believe that Saburouta very purposely drew Mei and Yuzu as lesbians from the outset for the very reason that this anime/manga is getting so much hate - she wanted to remove the ability of the audience to fetishize the relationship between Yuzu and Mei. For the typical yuri audience, this is anathema - it defies the whole reason they read yuri in the first place. Citrus is, as its core, a very cute and bittersweet love story that most people - gay, straight, or otherwise, can relate to.In Yuzu, Saburouta has created one of the most likeable, and dare I say loveable characters in manga/anime. Yes, her earnestness and plucky, can-do, kampai attitude is a standard trope, but there is way more to her than that. She actually shares a lot with Mei and Matsuri, parental attentiveness-wise. Her Mom is cool but absent, and new Dad Shou literally married her Mom just so that Mei would have a place to live away from gramps and he\'s off who-knows-where-doing-who-knows-what. The very first scene of the anime/manga is Yuzu hanging out with the slutty mean girls doing the teen-sex-talk thing. Yuzu desperately wants to belong somewhere, even if it is pretending and exaggerating with the nasty gyarus. She is the light to Mei\'s dark, again, literally and figuratively. Where Yuzu is overflowing with kindness, love, goodness, and understanding, Mei is a completely dark and vacant empty vessel. Over the series, you watch as Yuzu\'s love flows into Mei and completely changes her. But what about Mei, what does Mei do for Yuzu? Let\'s face it - Yuzu is a scatterbrained airhead. She acts without thinking, she has very little personal discipline, and would be distracted by a squirrel playing outside the window. For Yuzu, Mei is a much-needed reality check. When Yuzu is off floating around in teddy bear clouds, Mei is the one who is there to make sure her feet don\'t get out beyond reach. And Yuzu realizes this and also changes her behavior to be a more diligent student (with mixed results). The two of them are inextricably intertwined and their lives cannot be complete - at all - without the other.This is why Citrus, and Saburouta, are absolute genius. The subtlety, the way that you can go back and rewatch past episodes re-read past chapters with present knowledge to unlock the motivations of the characters is brilliant. down in modern day Japan and asked her to write a yuri manga.

You have been warned.When sisters meet unexpected sparks fly and an unlikely romance blossomsBased off a popular manga series of the same name Citrus is a Shoujo and romance anime that takes place within a school setting and gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if you not only find yourself welcoming in a stepsister into your family from your mothers new marriage but also the actions that...can happen if you were to fall in love with the stepsister that you just welcomed into your family. While Shoujo animes aren’t usually a genre that I'm really interested in when looking at the premise as well as the background source material that it makes use of I felt that the series itself certainly sounded interesting. Interesting enough in that I decided to give the series a chance. The first episode of the series I felt did a great job of introducing both the setting of the series which is the school and of the two main characters Yuzu and Mei. In particular, I felt that the sense of rivalry that developed between them from that moment was interesting considering how later events would play out. Looking back, I'm glad that I decided to give this series a chance as the series was one that I really enjoyed.The overall story of the series takes place at a famous and popular all-girls school situated in Tokyo that is well known for is strictness and conservative nature and follows the life of Yuzu Aihara a newly transferred student that moved to the city to join her recently remarried mother. As Yuzu, a fashionable and fun-loving girl transfers to the school and encounters the conservative and strict nature of the school she encounters the schools beautiful but strict student council president Mei Aihara who whether through fate or destiny is also Yuzu’s new stepsister. While clashing with Mei both in school and at home Yuzu soon learns that attraction and hatred just like love and hate are two sides of the same coin. As Yuzu and Mei clash with each other they also start to learn more about each other and slowly but surely the two start to bond and get closer with each other and slowly cross the line that divides the sisters and become something more. While slowly bonding with her new stepsister Yuzu as she gets used to both the school and the city also meets and makes a number of new friends while also encountering ones from her past. These include the arrogant but understanding student council vice president Himeko, the cunning and deceptive Junior high school student Matsuri and the Tachibana sisters Sara and Nina who while having differing personalities also have a close and loving bond between them. The overall story of the series covers roughly the first four volumes of the source material.YuzuYuzu Aihara played by veteran seiyuu singer Ayana Taketatsu of Sao and Youkoso fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A bright, fashionable and fun-loving girl by nature Yuzu at the beginning of the series was a newly transferred student that had just moved to the area to live with her mother who had remarried. While carefree and positive Yuzu was also someone that had a lot of self-confidence but did not let that make her arrogant and instead was something of a free spirit being both positive and friendly to everyone that she meets. As a result of these traits Yuzu was someone that was able to make friends easily and in this, it can be seen that she’s someone that’s very loyal to her friends and would work hard to help them and support them when they need help while hating it when she is unable to help them. While relaxed and carefree by nature it can be seen that Yuzu is also someone that can get serious at times especially with regards to helping her friends with their problems a side of her that I felt was a great contrast to her relaxed nature and fitted well with the two sides concepts that the series makes use off. In line with Yuzu’s carefree and free spirit type personality Yuzu is also someone that is noted to hate being constrained by rules especially those that restrict in how she should dress. This stems mainly from the fact that Yuzu is someone that believes that it’s the right of high school girls to be able to dress and act the way that they want in order to take advantage of their youth and any rules that prevent that will only be a bad thing for them. In line with this aspect of her personality Yuzu while mostly being someone that prefers to not stand out is also someone that’s also bold enough to make her views on subjects that concern her known even if she was to face censure when doing so.As the series goes on and as Yuzu gets to both know Mei better and encounter and befriend more characters in the school Yuzu’s personality gradually starts to change as she finds her life becoming more intertwined with that of Mei. At the beginning of the series Yuzu while carefree was also someone that was rather stubborn with her beliefs and often had arguments with people that had different views to her. As the series progresses this side of her personality gradually changes, and Yuzu begins to show more consideration to others while trying to rein in her more brash behaviour and try to think of the consequences of an action before doing them. This change is best shown in Yuzu’s willingness to admit her own mistakes and attempts to take responsibly for her actions and any effects that it had whether on the school or her friends. At the beginning of the series, Yuzu and Mei did not have the best of relationships or the best of first encounters and it can be said that their first feelings on meeting each other as sisters for the first time was hated and dislike rather than happiness and joy that would be the expected. Unlike Yuzu’s carefree and freethinking nature that values independence Mei’s personality, in the beginning, was the complete opposite being rule-bound, and strict which Yuzu applied to both Mei and her family. As the series goes on and they get to know each other more this feeling of antagonism gradually softens, and Yuzu starts seeing and treating Mei as family. As the series goes and Yuzu gets to see and understand the pain that exists within Mei she becomes somewhat determined to break through the shell of sadness that Mei has erected around herself fighting hard to get through to the real Mei that was behind it in a determined attempt to give her what she had craved the most in her life which was love and a place where she can belong too. As a result of this journey, the bond between the two gradually grows deeper as Mei slowly opens herself up to Yuzu’s determined attempts to help her and in the process creating a deeper relationship between the two that Yuzu never expected. The character of Yuzu I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed as the series went on. Its been a while since I had seen Ayana Taketatsu in a lead role, but I felt that she did an excellent job of portraying the character of Yuzu.MeiMei Aihara voiced by veteran seiyuu Minami Tsuda of Guilty Crown fame is one of the main characters of the series. The new stepsister to Yuzu Mei’s personality and attitude is markedly different from Yuzu in more ways than one. An attractive and intelligent girl by nature Mei is the very image of a cool beauty that deals with every situation with calm and logical solutions that hint at her level-headed nature. A quiet and composed girl Mei is someone that believes fervently that rules are the very pillars of society and that without it society would only be in chaos. This is a belief that Mei believes greatly and tries to inspire the students of her school in her capacity as student council president. While a quiet girl by nature Mei, however, is not unsociable and indeed while most people assume that she’s rather aloof the truth of the matter is that Mei can also be friendly to those that she has befriended and can be surprisingly understanding of others while being courteous and polite to those that she doesn’t yet know. From the beginning of the series, it can be seen that Mei is someone that’s very hardworking and takes her duty as student council president seriously. Indeed, she is the type of person that would try to do everything by herself and be unwilling to bother others with it even if it was their role to help in the first place which shows her dutiful and determined nature. To many of the students that she manages Mei is someone that is cool, level-headed and efficient that makes it hard for them to approach however the reality of this is that Mei while certainly cool and efficient is also someone that remembers those that have helped her in some way a side of her that I really liked.As the series goes on and more of Mei’s personality is revealed beneath the calm and composed attitude that she projects to her fellow students Mei is, in fact, someone that lives in constant pain and isolation and is someone that doesn’t trust others easily. Rather it can be seen that Mei is someone that tries to push those that try to know her away. As a result of having lived alone for much of her life in the beginning of the series it can be seen that Mei like Yuzu needed time to get used to the fact that they now had a much larger family than before and while the relationship between Mei and Yuzu and her mother was somewhat distant at first this gradually changed as the series went on in line with the deepening bond that is forged between them. While hinted on in the beginning as the series progressed it become apparent that Mei’s relationship with her family was rather strained and while she feels indebted to her grandfather who had raised her this also acted as a constraint for her life as well as it limited the freedom that she could have within her life. However arguably the main issue that had caused Mei’s heart to be constrained was, without doubt, the strained relationship that she had with her father which caused her to work fiercely to protect the school even to the point of causing her life to become nothing more than a set of performances. After making peace with her father and fixing this Mei’s attitude gradually began to soften and she begins to break out of her shell and not just be more open with her feelings but also learn to place her trust in others more. At the beginning of the series, Mei’s relationship with Yuzu was that of wariness which was somewhat understandable and kept her distance from her. But as the series progressed on and she gets to see and understand Yuzu’s personality a bit more this began to change. After overcoming many challenges together Mei’s attitude towards Yuzu begins to change becoming more positive and open-minded and less formal in her dealings with Yuzu showing the improving bond between them. While still retaining some of her aloof nature Mei’s personality gradually begins to thaw and begins showing her more honest and warmer feelings towards Yuzu openly unlike before. The character of Mei was an interesting one as her personality while contrasting greatly with that of Yuzu was the result of problems that was caused by family-related issues that ended up constraining her life which I felt was appropriate as it matched well with the theme of family and bonding by breaking through the wall that someone has erected to protect and hide them. I felt that her seiyuu Minami Tsuda did an excellent job in portraying the character of Mei.MatsuriMatsuri Mizusawa voiced by veteran seiyuu Shiori Izawa of Asterisk wars fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is an old friend of Yuzu. A 2nd-year junior high school student Matsuri at the beginning of the series behaved somewhat like an old friend to Yuzu being overly attached to her while still maintaining an innocent charm that was unique to her. On the surface, Matsuri was a kind, caring and polite person that seemed to value friendships and bonds.As the series goes on and more of Matsuri’s personality is revealed it can be seen that beneath this surface Matsuri’s personality is very different. Beneath her surface personality, it can be seen that Matsuri is someone that is cunning, manipulative, and deceitful and will use every available means to get ahead of others as long as victory is hers. In addition, Matsuri has also shown to be rather possessive of things that are considered dear to her such as her role as Yuzu’s little sister. At the beginning of the series, Matsuri was shown to have a rather warped view of what friendships and indeed what a relationship is as she took neither of them seriously and viewed them as something akin to a game. In this, she treated both as something that she can take advantage off to allow her to survive in society while at the same time pushing away things like love and warmth that is a result of the relationships that can form between friends. In a way, Matsuri’s personality, in the beginning, was very much like what Mei had been experiencing at the beginning of the series. As the series progresses and Matsuri see’s the depth of the relationship that exists between Yuzu and Mei and after seeing the truth of what she was missing Matsuri’s personality gradually starts to change becoming friendlier and more open with her feelings while trying to understand what real friendship is by forming her first real friendships with others.HimekoHimeko Momokino voiced by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kobo of Youkoso and Seiren fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A member of an upper-class family on account of her impressive and elegant hairstyle and the shops that she frequents Himeko true to her status is a self-confident, determined and somewhat stubborn person by nature that serves as one of the school’s vice presidents and as a result assists Mei in her duties as student council president. A childhood of Mei Himeko is someone that while arrogant is also someone that believes in rules and order and would often pursue rule breakers with vengeance which is often used for comical effort within the series. While arrogant and confident in herself Himeko is also someone that cares deeply about her friends and can be quite perceptive when it comes to sensing when something is bothering them.At the beginning of the series, Himeko had an antagonist like relationship with Yuzu as the latter seemed to enjoy breaking the very same rules that Himeko see’s as important to both the school and herself. As the series goes on and Himeko’s personality is gradually revealed it can be seen that Himeko’s feelings towards Mei go beyond that of what can be considered a simple friendship. In fact, it can be seen that Himeko has a lot of pride in serving as not just Mei’s vice president but also her oldest friend as well something she uses often when she and Yuzu face off. While Yuzu and Himeko remain rivals for Mei’s affections as the series goes on it can be seen that both share the same concern for Mei as each other and indeed when it comes to Mei’s well being it can be seen that both would drop their rivalry to help her when needed something that I felt was nicely done.NinaNina Tachibana voiced by Rei Matsuzaki is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Yuzu’s friends that she encounters while on a school excursion to Kyoto. A high school girl from another area Nina is the younger among the Tachibana sisters and very different in attitude to her sister. A kind, caring and intelligent girl Nina unlike her sister has a rather laid-back personality and is the kind of person that will not worry needlessly about things that have already happened. True to her laid-back personality Nina is also someone that is really forgetful as well. Nina’s most prominent trait is without a doubt her tall physical height which I find to be pretty surprising for a high school girl.  Despite Nina’s laid-back personality, it can be seen that Nina has a very deep bond with her sister and is very loyal to her to the point that she’s willing to act as the villain if it means that her sister is able to have happiness.SaraSara Tachibana voiced by veteran seiyuu Hisako Kanemoto of Food Wars and Gate fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Yuzu’s friends having met and befriended her when they met in Kyoto. A high school girl from another high school Sara is the elder of the Tachibana sisters. A cheerful, positive and considerate person by nature Sara is someone that unlike her sister Nina is someone that prefers to not waste time pondering on something and prefers to strike it out in one-go kinda like a boxer and as a result is also a bold, brave and determined person. While bold and daring Sara is also someone that’s perceptive of others feelings and is the kind of person that will let go of something if it would help others despite the pain that she will feel showing off her good nature. Because of this, however, Sara Is shown to have a dislike for people that give up too easily as she feels that if you don’t go all the way then all you did was take half steps that ended up creating nothing.AMVThe animation for the series I felt was pretty well done with both the school and the uniforms for it being both well designed and detailed. The character designs for the series main characters I felt were also well done and were faithful to the source material to which I'm thankful. Music wise the series OST as well as the opening and ending themes I felt were excellent and did a great job at conveying the different emotions and feelings that each scene featured. Voice acting wise I felt that the main cast did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters. In particular, I felt that Ayana Taketatsu, Minami Tsuda, and Yurika Kubo did a fantastic job of portraying their respective characters.Overall conclusionOverall Citrus was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I felt that its main strong points were its premise, story, characters, animation and voice acting and its unique use of romantic relationships to heal the hole that had formed within someone’s heart. The main premise of the show naturally is the encounter between Yuzu and Mei after Yuzu moves to the city and the subsequent escalating relationship that they forge between them. The decision to make an all-girls school as the series main setting I thought was an interesting move as though increasingly rare in this day and age single gender girls have the ability to create unique environments that can have the effect of both providing an effective place for students to learn and progress but at the same time trap them beneath layers of responsibility. One of the main themes that the story makes use off is that of the relationships that a family can have and the effect that this can have on members of that family. The decision to make use of the stepsister concept an idea unique to parents that have remarried I felt was a move well done as it not only gave the pretence for Yuzu to move to Tokyo to join her mother but also meet her new stepsister Mei as well. While Yuzu and Mei may not have had the best of first encounters watching the two of them try and come to terms with one another’s existence within their lives was interesting as until they met each other each had thought that they were alone within the family. This gradual process of getting used to being sisters contrasted well with the romantic aspect of the show. The romantic aspect of the show I felt also did a great job at making use of this theme of family as while developing feelings for each other Yuzu and Mei also in the process started to explore the many wishes, desires and restrictions and responsibilities that lay within them that stopped them from achieving the things that they desire. This exchange of feelings as with everything is two sides of the same coin and just as Mei is able to see the hesitation that lay within Yuzu she too is able to see the many problems that Mei hides within her heart problems caused by both a carefree father and an overbearing grandfather that when combined with the school almost suffocates Mei in responsibility and trapping her real feelings in a place where few can reach. The desire of Yuzu to both understand and open up Mei’s closed off heart and expose her true feelings I thought was a great use of the family theme as it provided the perfect key to open up Mei’s closed off heart and provide her with the very thing that she was missing in her life which was that of family warmth.Overall Citrus was an interesting anime that made use of an interesting premise and a unique way of forging a romantic relationship that can be used to open someone’s closed off heart while simultaneously reminding us that while society can be a harsh place trying to take too much responsibility by yourself and not letting others see your true feelings can be a bad thing. Sometimes its worth it to maybe stop one day and have one long talk with someone that you trust and not hide them anymore. In terms of final score, I think Citrus certainly deserves a score of 10/10. can happen if you were to fall in love with the stepsister that you just welcomed into your family. While Shoujo animes aren’t usually a genre that I'm really interested in when looking at the premise as well as the background source material that it makes use of I felt that the series itself certainly sounded interesting. Interesting enough in that I decided to give the series a chance. The first episode of the series I felt did a great job of introducing both the setting of the series which is the school and of the two main characters Yuzu and Mei. In particular, I felt that the sense of rivalry that developed between them from that moment was interesting considering how later events would play out. Looking back, I'm glad that I decided to give this series a chance as the series was one that I really enjoyed.The overall story of the series takes place at a famous and popular all-girls school situated in Tokyo that is well known for is strictness and conservative nature and follows the life of Yuzu Aihara a newly transferred student that moved to the city to join her recently remarried mother. As Yuzu, a fashionable and fun-loving girl transfers to the school and encounters the conservative and strict nature of the school she encounters the schools beautiful but strict student council president Mei Aihara who whether through fate or destiny is also Yuzu’s new stepsister. While clashing with Mei both in school and at home Yuzu soon learns that attraction and hatred just like love and hate are two sides of the same coin. As Yuzu and Mei clash with each other they also start to learn more about each other and slowly but surely the two start to bond and get closer with each other and slowly cross the line that divides the sisters and become something more. While slowly bonding with her new stepsister Yuzu as she gets used to both the school and the city also meets and makes a number of new friends while also encountering ones from her past. These include the arrogant but understanding student council vice president Himeko, the cunning and deceptive Junior high school student Matsuri and the Tachibana sisters Sara and Nina who while having differing personalities also have a close and loving bond between them. The overall story of the series covers roughly the first four volumes of the source material.YuzuYuzu Aihara played by veteran seiyuu singer Ayana Taketatsu of Sao and Youkoso fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A bright, fashionable and fun-loving girl by nature Yuzu at the beginning of the series was a newly transferred student that had just moved to the area to live with her mother who had remarried. While carefree and positive Yuzu was also someone that had a lot of self-confidence but did not let that make her arrogant and instead was something of a free spirit being both positive and friendly to everyone that she meets. As a result of these traits Yuzu was someone that was able to make friends easily and in this, it can be seen that she’s someone that’s very loyal to her friends and would work hard to help them and support them when they need help while hating it when she is unable to help them. While relaxed and carefree by nature it can be seen that Yuzu is also someone that can get serious at times especially with regards to helping her friends with their problems a side of her that I felt was a great contrast to her relaxed nature and fitted well with the two sides concepts that the series makes use off. In line with Yuzu’s carefree and free spirit type personality Yuzu is also someone that is noted to hate being constrained by rules especially those that restrict in how she should dress. This stems mainly from the fact that Yuzu is someone that believes that it’s the right of high school girls to be able to dress and act the way that they want in order to take advantage of their youth and any rules that prevent that will only be a bad thing for them. In line with this aspect of her personality Yuzu while mostly being someone that prefers to not stand out is also someone that’s also bold enough to make her views on subjects that concern her known even if she was to face censure when doing so.As the series goes on and as Yuzu gets to both know Mei better and encounter and befriend more characters in the school Yuzu’s personality gradually starts to change as she finds her life becoming more intertwined with that of Mei. At the beginning of the series Yuzu while carefree was also someone that was rather stubborn with her beliefs and often had arguments with people that had different views to her. As the series progresses this side of her personality gradually changes, and Yuzu begins to show more consideration to others while trying to rein in her more brash behaviour and try to think of the consequences of an action before doing them. This change is best shown in Yuzu’s willingness to admit her own mistakes and attempts to take responsibly for her actions and any effects that it had whether on the school or her friends. At the beginning of the series, Yuzu and Mei did not have the best of relationships or the best of first encounters and it can be said that their first feelings on meeting each other as sisters for the first time was hated and dislike rather than happiness and joy that would be the expected. Unlike Yuzu’s carefree and freethinking nature that values independence Mei’s personality, in the beginning, was the complete opposite being rule-bound, and strict which Yuzu applied to both Mei and her family. As the series goes on and they get to know each other more this feeling of antagonism gradually softens, and Yuzu starts seeing and treating Mei as family. As the series goes and Yuzu gets to see and understand the pain that exists within Mei she becomes somewhat determined to break through the shell of sadness that Mei has erected around herself fighting hard to get through to the real Mei that was behind it in a determined attempt to give her what she had craved the most in her life which was love and a place where she can belong too. As a result of this journey, the bond between the two gradually grows deeper as Mei slowly opens herself up to Yuzu’s determined attempts to help her and in the process creating a deeper relationship between the two that Yuzu never expected. The character of Yuzu I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed as the series went on. Its been a while since I had seen Ayana Taketatsu in a lead role, but I felt that she did an excellent job of portraying the character of Yuzu.MeiMei Aihara voiced by veteran seiyuu Minami Tsuda of Guilty Crown fame is one of the main characters of the series. The new stepsister to Yuzu Mei’s personality and attitude is markedly different from Yuzu in more ways than one. An attractive and intelligent girl by nature Mei is the very image of a cool beauty that deals with every situation with calm and logical solutions that hint at her level-headed nature. A quiet and composed girl Mei is someone that believes fervently that rules are the very pillars of society and that without it society would only be in chaos.

While a quiet girl by nature Mei, however, is not unsociable and indeed while most people assume that she’s rather aloof the truth of the matter is that Mei can also be friendly to those that she has befriended and can be surprisingly understanding of others while being courteous and polite to those that she doesn’t yet know.

Gave me chills every minute. Characters are insanely well written and so is the story. I hope everyone gets to know the feeling of finally getting home to watch Citrus after 8 hours of physical work at car part factory. It made everything so worth it. k??? r????? omnia palmia pappa vessassa kuremiko mcdonalds 1337 s1lent dead canary san quentin the chair ', ""I try to complete it. Citrus is just hard to watch. The characters act without any thinking, consent is not even existing, I think. The dialogues are often cringy and contribute nothing to the story. I don't know the original source, so I can't compare it, but the Anime itself is according to my thinking: a trainwreck, which tries too hard to be relatable in some sort, but fails horribly.The art is mediocre, nothing too special, but still good to look at.I wouldn't recommend it, especially to those, who prefer story over fanservice yuri scenes.I'm actually disappointed. I expected nothing and still - Disappointment "", ""I just love how people always react in such manner regarding Yuri anime, like, the same people who would be supportive regarding this plot if it was Yaoi, but it's okay.I understand people who haven't read the manga to be shocked by the first episode and just be like ''wtf is going on'' but I don't understand the hate you'd be giving the anime when you're not even trying to give it a shot, writing a big review, trying to look as educated as possible when you only saw one episode, or even just two.This anime is really fun and good in my opinion and...yes, it'll not change your life completely unless you take some courage from the characters about coming out one day.I might be daring to say that I like the plot, I like how everything develops, I like the music so much, I like the art too, I think it'll only get better and I am ready for it.

Don\'t get me wrong, I\'ll evaluate it as an anime not as an adaptation but I just want to say that it really stood out to me how the anime made the setting pop out more than what the manga did. I never really felt the surroundings in the manga and I\'m really glad with this since it holds an importance in the...show. It also stays faithful to the source material as of now but again, it\'s still too early to end it there.To begin, this show is about romance. Lesbian romance.Now with this kind of stories, people like me usually watch it for the sexual fantasy and stuff. It\'s more about the characters so It doesn\'t really need to have a mind bending plot. It does have some sensitive themes if that concerns you. With that said, it does a good job on executing it\'s story.We have this girl; Yuzu, who is very enthusiastic about being a gal and even lies about having boyfriends to her friends but she gets transferred to an all-girls school because her ""mama suddenly found a new papa."" On that school she meets other characters but most importantly Mei, the intriguing student council president/grandchild of the school chairman/the betrothed in an early age character (trust me, this is not a spoiler.) They started on the wrong-foot pretty quickly because of their conflicting personalities but what they don\'t know is that they\'re connected much closer than they think. We find more and more things about Mei through Yuzu and boom, character development.It gets spicy very early but it doesn\'t feel rushed or forced and there\'s nothing I can really complain about. That\'s just the scenario but the pacing itself is fine along with the direction. It kinda feel like a k-drama. The use of lighting, the backgrounds, blurring or shaking camera shots, I love how they use the light behind Mei to hide her face when she stood up then showed her expression afterwards as she walks away. I can tell that the studio respects the manga and is really trying all they can to not just merely copy what\'s drawn in the source material. The art style really captivates me because it\'s not overly detailed but it looks so good.The animation isn\'t outstanding or anything but it doesn\'t have to. It\'s good enough for a drama show and the studio knows what it needs to emphasize. Like that scene where Mei searched for Yuzu\'s smartphone In Ep 1. That scene wasn\'t just to grab (no pun intended) attention, it\'s actually important because that\'s the reason why Mei left such a huge impression on Yuzu when they met. I really like the occational dynamic camera movement too like those in the OP. The show can look good even without that but they still went for it and that\'s always good to see. The music is fine but I don\'t have much to say about it really, there\'s some good ones like the one played during Yuzu\'s bath in Ep 1 but nothing that stands out.I\'m not sure if this is helpful or anything but I like the show so far that\'s why I\'m persuading people to give it a try. show.

Another thing is I don\'t review this like an idiot who thinks after reading Beserk, Stein, Monster, FMA:B, or any other ""masterpieces"" that they have the philosophers hammer and the alchemist stone. I also rate mostly on enjoyment primarily. All right lets begin.Act 1; The Story:8The story accomplishes what it set out to do, and that is a dramatic story about two lesbian lover who are now sisters. Now let me say this, don\'t expect this to be a masterpiece in terms...of story, pacing, and execution. (Though it\'s my personal masterpiece) Ep1 spoilers only. The story begins with Yuzu talking to her friends on how she want\'s a boyfriend. Her luck was awful, as she went to an all girls school. At the entrance she meets Mei, a rather calm and beautiful girl, as she has violated school regulation. She then sifts Yuzu to get her phone and tell her to wash the makeup off. She then encounters another girl who had the same troubles of the school regulation, Harumin. Harumin basically tells her why the students are rather dull and how they were sheltered. They become friends as they are both alike. She then has her first conflict as she sees Mei kissing the same teacher. When she tried to get away, they notice she was nearby from her clumsy mistake. She runs. She then returns home only to be shocked that Mei, the same girl, was her new sister. She seems rather stunned and uneasy on Mei. From there she bugged her until she brought up the incident and asked how can she kiss if she is not genuinely in love and is only doing it for the thrill. This is where I\'ll end it here as I might get this review taken down for play-by-play and if i spoiled the first major plot point. The show does the drama right, most of the tension is explainable and the execution is generally done well.  The grimes with it\'s a little fast pace at times, but everything is well done and In My Opinion, great. Though the story is about same sex love, and if your against that then don\'t watch. As for the yuri scenes, they are mostly explained why it happens, so to put it off as fan service is definitely wrong.Act 2; Animation and Soundtrack: 7.6The animation for the show is Amazing, but some of the original art work from the manga is not shown at the same time. One of the many good things about the manga is the artwork and the anime has shown to reflect that but at the same time have a modern take on the show\'s artwork. Now more on about the errors in the animation, there are scenes that look wonky. Though the animation has gotten better, there is still scenes that look messed up still, but it was less apparent with it\'s improvement. The ost fits the show well and are mostly, music to my ears. The VA\'s have done their part greatly and for their dub counterpart(Dub isn\'t my favorite thong to listen) they have seem to do justice for dubbers. The op and ed are another thing that I have to give praise to as they really fit the show.Act 3; Character: 8.3Most of the characters are really fun and interesting. No character doesn\'t feel annoying or boring. Personally I like Momokino as her character design and her personality I can definitely enjoy. All the characters have a motivational factor for their actions and their personality are great. Still, there are still some things to push them over for, the characters are great.Act 4; Enjoyment and Overall: 9 (for enjoyment) 8 (Overall)I really enjoyed the anime so far as it has been a great adaptation for the series. It really has been my number 3 show for the winter season so far. (#1 is Magus Bride) Overall it gets a 9/10 and my recommendations are Dear My Girl, The Star and The Flower, and Sakura Trick.FinSidenote; If you literally reviewed this like a philosopher, then you going about an entertainment media the wrong way.What would you like me to review next, Berserk after 100-200 chapters, Magus Bride, Hajime No Ippo Manga or show, or would you like me to watch your personal favorite show.

Either just the yuri fan service show or a romance drama. Typically romance anime's load themselves with misunderstandings but not this show, this show has ascended past such silly tropes. Because this show only can further the plot with sexual assaults. For example Momokino has supposedly been friends with Mei for over 10 years but only decides to do anything sexual with Mei when Yuzu starts being friendly with her. She also goes from being a stuck up bitch to immediately ok with doing that in school grounds. All because her best friend...got a new sister. Wouldn't it only be natural for someone to spend time with someone who just became part of their family. Nope, all logic and reason takes the backseat until we have gotten at least one sexual assault per-episode. Yuri is nice and everything, but that doesn't make it a good anime. got a new sister.

I don't count this as a girl's love anime, I think there's a little too much rape like moments for it to be counted as a genuine relationship.I understand that Mei is really screwed up and mentally ill, and that Yuzu is a closeted lesbian, but it still seems rapey. Like Mei is just pissed off and letting out her pent up emotional frustrations by trying to have sex/whatever with Yuzu.It's not hot, it's mental illness. I do love yuri anime, I really do, I'm gay myself but this does not...represent a healthy girlxgirl relationship. represent a healthy girlxgirl relationship."", 'Not a lot can be said of this anime except that it was literally written to fetishize lesbian women.To begin with, the story is basically 100% trash. There\'s nothing really redeemable about it. It\'s about a girl who basically sexually assaults her step-sister. After a while, her step-sister thinks it\'s love. That\'s pretty much it. NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS. Even as someone who indulges in shoujo, I really hate the sexual assault tropes that they try to normalize.The art is the only part I have no complaint about. Everyone is gorgeous and the backgrounds are so well done that I wished I could just...watch it on mute half the time. Not to mention that all the characters\' eyes were simply breathtaking.The sound could have been better. The opening and closing theme were a little annoying and they just got on my nerves. The voices of the characters were alright.Oh god, the characters. There is no development. Whatsoever. The characters are stagnant, fetishized stereotypes of lesbian women (or pan, as it seems in Sara\'s case) and there\'s nothing beyond that. After watching this, I feel uncomfortable knowing it probably served as something for people with a lesbian fetish to jerk off to and nothing else. There is no plot or characters pretty much-- this anime exists purely for those who looks for lesbian smut and nothing else.I didn\'t enjoy this. I dreaded watching the episode every weekend as it came out. It was terrible. I watched a lot of airing anime this year (which I usually don\'t do) and this was always the worst part of my weekend, spent banging my head against a wall and going ""why?"". As one of those OCD people who has to finish all the shows I start, this was torture for me.I would recommend this if you: like lesbian smut for the sake of having girlxgirl in it, like the classic sexual assault trope, like the pretty artI would NOT recommend this if you: are big on consent, were looking for real romance, wanted real plot, wanted real characters/character development, hate fetishism of sexualityI wish I had read an honest review about this before I started watching.

It's a shame really, as it has some very good qualities that most people overlook because all they can see is the bathroom scene from episode 1.// Story // 9/10The idea is simple. Yuzu's mom re-marries after her husband passed away when Yuzu was young. Yuzu and her mom understandable move out into a common appartment for the whole family!Yuzu then has to attend a new school, an all girls school.She gets caught up with the student council for her appearance and breaking of the rules, and gets...into a mini-argument with the council president.Talk about a first day.Oh and she also catches the super hot teacher kissing said student council president, and did I mention that the pres is now her new step sister?Yeah, this one kind of seems unrealistic, but to me, it works and it sets the stone for everything that is to come.Yuzu now has to make friends with Mei, her new step sister, but it goes a bit further than just friends, especially in the manga, *wink wink*// Art // 10/10Like most Yuri shows, this series has a very polished and clean look. Everything is bright, the characters are all flawless.

The difference is very noticeable, but doesn't hinder the watching experience too much if you haven't read the manga.The setting isn't anything original. Tokyo, all girls school.

Unfortunately, this show quickly lost all the attributes that could have made it different from others Girls Love stories. Let\'s analyze the main problems that this program presented:1. Yuzu\'s development: During the first episode, we saw her enrolling to a new institute becuause of her mother\'s new engagement. The rules of this place were strict and very conservative and this constrasted with Yuzu\'s personality. To this point the story sounded cool beacuse there...was a lot of potential with how Yuzu can adapt to this new lifestyle in the institute and, of course, with the new members of her family. Well, this potential was thrown away in the same episode. Despite that she was warned about her current clothing, she continued going to the institute with the same clothes making a contradiction of the rules of the ""strict"" institute. We saw her being a carefree girl when she spoke about her priorities at her new institute. We saw, also, this attitude reflected with her interactions with her classmates and the student council director. Later, Mei was introduced and she decided to touch some parts of Yuzu\'s body and this characterization started to fade away. It is revealed to us, later, that Mei would be Yuzu\'s new stepsister, yes, fucking convenient and, after that, Mei decided kiss Yuzu and, from now on, Yuzu was rewritten as an one dimensional girl in love who only want to bed with Mei and a fan service source. Are you seriously going to tell me that by a kiss all of Yuzu\'s characterization was modified? Couldn\'t she ask herself, in the first instance, her doubts about his sexual inclination and, progressively, fall in love with Mei as in any real life romance, especially if it is this type of GL romance? No fucking idea. In adittion, the show clearly indicated that Yuzu was a straight girl seeing her bad reaction to knowing that she was going to an all-girls institute, so the fact that she fell in love with and obsessed with Mei for a simple kiss, without rethinking her sexual orientation for even a few minutes, makes things even worse.2.Conflict avoidance: This show, I don\'t know why, tried to avoid any type of conflict that can have lead to a good character development and, instead, made worse the quality of the same. For example, Mei\'s grandfather was introduced as a character who strongly opposed a possible relationship between Yuzu and Mei during the second episode, however, minutes later in the same episode, he simply forgave her by lifting the penalty she had received and this conflict ended. The worst thing is that, after this, the grandfather had no relevance to the plot. This formula was repeated during the next episodes. A new random character was introduced in order to interfere with the relationship between Yuzu and Mei, the conflict was resolved in the way that suited the script best and Yuzu and Mei ended up without making any progress in their relationship, even, in many cases, it seemed that they ended up hating each other even more. Also, the random character introduced disappear from the scene permanently and the cycle repeats.3. Mei: She\'s just a manipulative edge girl that tried to torture Yuzu because her dark past with the abandon of her father. This doesn\'t have any type of sense. To begin with, Yuzu is a person she has just met, there is no need to escape her anger and repression with her, did she not think of going to a psychologist for professional help? Mystery. Mei\'s family had a lot of money, so paying for a professional shouldn\'t have suppose a problem if you ask me. This show, also, gave us a terrible message about toxic relationships because while Mei treated Yuzu worse, the second, for some illogical and stupid reason unknown to me, falls more in love and gets more horny for her. It is not that the series tries to criticize or point out this type of relationship as something negative since it focuses more on the fanservice scenes and that the viewer inserts himself into the character of Mei in this case, telling us that while we treat the couple badly and we give him/her a simple kiss, he/she will fall in love and he/she will be much more faithful to us. Terrible.Another aspect that I really disliked about her is the fact that Yuzu always apologize to her for... nothing, because most of the time the problems are Mei\'s fault by not doing anything for the relationship unless a third person was involved, so yes, she had no real interest in Yuzu. It\'s an one side romance that didn\'t go anywhere thanks to the inexistent character development from both sides to this point.4. Ending?: After the first episode, the show limited to be an episodic one with the formula presented in the second point, trying to force the viewer to watch the manga to see if they are finally established as a couple in one point, aka, cliffhanger. The worst part is that none of them had any significant development, Yuzu kept making the same mistakes without learning from them (like dressing inappropriately at the institute), Mei was still an edgy girl who tried to justify her behavior with her past. So, it\'s very hard to find hope that the manga (in case you haven\'t seen), will be able to solve this basic flaws in the characterization.CONCLUSIONIt\'s a terrible anime that wasted all the potential that it had after the first episode focusing more in the fanservice and the cheap melodrama instead of make a proper character and romance development. was a lot of potential with how Yuzu can adapt to this new lifestyle in the institute and, of course, with the new members of her family. Well, this potential was thrown away in the same episode.

It is not that the series tries to criticize or point out this type of relationship as something negative since it focuses more on the fanservice scenes and that the viewer inserts himself into the character of Mei in this case, telling us that while we treat the couple badly and we give him/her a simple kiss, he/she will fall in love and he/she will be much more faithful to us. Terrible.Another aspect that I really disliked about her is the fact that Yuzu always apologize to her for... nothing, because most of the time the problems are Mei\'s fault by not doing anything for the relationship unless a third person was involved, so yes, she had no real interest in Yuzu. It\'s an one side romance that didn\'t go anywhere thanks to the inexistent character development from both sides to this point.4. Ending?: After the first episode, the show limited to be an episodic one with the formula presented in the second point, trying to force the viewer to watch the manga to see if they are finally established as a couple in one point, aka, cliffhanger. The worst part is that none of them had any significant development, Yuzu kept making the same mistakes without learning from them (like dressing inappropriately at the institute), Mei was still an edgy girl who tried to justify her behavior with her past. So, it\'s very hard to find hope that the manga (in case you haven\'t seen), will be able to solve this basic flaws in the characterization.CONCLUSIONIt\'s a terrible anime that wasted all the potential that it had after the first episode focusing more in the fanservice and the cheap melodrama instead of make a proper character and romance development.', ""I have never, in my life, felt this compelled to write a review about an anime. I was on board with citrus for the first 75% of the anime, I really was, before I realized why I'd had this weird tinge in the back of my brain that made me ultimately uncomfortable with the entire anime.It's not the stepcest, it's not the pushing each other around and pulling at each others clothes although it's still pathetic how yuri and sexual assault go hand in hand in anime.No, it was the fact that the main character, Aihara Yuzu, is the classic abusive relationship victim. She's not...the perfect protagonist, and she makes her mistakes, but she without a DOUBT, makes solid leaps and bounds early on in character progression. She sees her mistakes, she sees her faults, and she actively works on herself in an effort to appease and comfort Mei.In turn, Mei rewards her by treating her like garbage at almost every step. What is once seen as being shy, or reserved, turns into full mental and verbal abuse towards Yuzu. Every time Mei seems to make some sort of character progression, she undermines herself by reverting back to being terrible towards Yuzu who is always, actively, trying to help create some sort of peace.Even the near psychopathic side loli character ends up being more redeemable than Aihara Mei.Yuzu does NOT know when to stop, and give up. In my opinion, that should've been very early on in the anime. It's almost uncomfortable to watch her be consumed almost obsessively by this love for Mei that Mei doesn't really shoot down. Yuzu is being led on and taken advantage of for a large portion of this anime.I'd say watch this anime, if only you want to learn more about what abusive relationships look like so you can better see signs of it in your day to day life and try to help anyone suffering in an abusive relationship. the perfect protagonist, and she makes her mistakes, but she without a DOUBT, makes solid leaps and bounds early on in character progression.

If that bothers you, fine you can skip and miss out on a romance that many current animes have forgotten. Yuzu, the gal-looking one, gets enrolled in an all-girl high school. Breaking the rules on the first day, she meets the student council president, Mei, who not only turns out to be the school chair's granddaughter and her newly adoptive younger sister. From here, Citrus presents...watchers with two main developments: Yuzu's shift from delinquent to an older sister and Mei's dealing with family problems. To avoid spoilers, let me just say that while there is touching, it is not forced and is much more rooted in innocence and stress. Learning about these characters as the story progresses is not entirely mind-blowing, especially in a high school setting, but it does it and does it well enough. Good. But its not. The last few episodes threw this out and were QUITE disappointing. I am not going to spoil anything but be prepared (5/10).Art (8/10): I am not really sure how to explain this catergory. I guess the character designs look good and noticable. What actually makes them great is that they are noticable and not flashy (no yellow hair and orange jump suit, just black/brown ish hair) The background is pretty to look at. Some of the art drops in quality for moments (particularly the eyes) and it takes away from the experience a little, but overall great.Sound (7/10): I love both the opening and ending themes. 10/10. The series does not really utilize sound, so I have to give this catergory (while reluctantly) a 7/10.Character (6/10): Yuzu just has this rare charisma to her that she is very easy to root for. Her relationship with Mei translates as genuine and with good intent. So far, I enjoy watching her on the screen very much. Mei is OKAY, but I admit that there are some good use of subtle detail. The rest of the cast, however, is generic... well accept 1 who I will not talk about for spoilers :). My favorite part about these characters is that they feel human. Everyone is flawed, and everyone is genuine. Well done for making me care Citrus. The two white haired girls on the cover and opening, however, are pretty unenjoyable. These two additional characters kind of ruined this show for me. If this anime was 10 episodes, I would be more satisfied. 6/10Final Thoughts: Go watch Citrus. I think it beats Darling in the Franxx in terms of romance and characters, but you know that's just my opinion. Citrus is good, but its not even close to very good; just watch it to enjoy and don't let the yuri bother you. watchers with two main developments: Yuzu's shift from delinquent to an older sister and Mei's dealing with family problems.

This isn’t a word, but if it was, let’s go ahead and slap it on Citrus. That’s what this show is, problematic in every way but its core. Let’s slap dreadful and sickening on there as well.Citrus, at the surface, is a simple show that could go to many places narratively. We then meet the MC. Yuzu Aihara just stepped out of an 80s movie/ poorly written Episode story (props to you if you know what those are) and has entered a new, private all-girls school. Her mother was...recently divorced and remarried to the son of the Chairmen of the School, whose daughter is the student council president. So we’ve got a typical start of a romance school anime, nothing out of the ordinary here.However, not ten minutes in, after an OP that sounds like it has been pulled out of the bucket of standard anime OPs and riddled with incestuous hints at what’s to come (aren’t you just so excited?), is a scene where Yuzu, as she is arriving on the school campus, and in many violations of this school’s strict dress code, is explicitly touched sexually, without consent, mind you, by the student council president, whose name we later learn to be Mei. Mei’s hands are everywhere a stranger’s hands shouldn't be, and Yuzu has repeatedly said “stop, leave me alone”. That probably just took you off guard since, you know, her stepsister just sexually assaulted her. And she just walks away like it was nothing.I wish I had counted how many times a character sexually assaulted another character in this show. I am positive I couldn’t count it, on one hand, let alone two. And it’s not just the occasional throw of the skirt or grope, it’s full-on, I’m ripping off your shirt and trying to kiss you while having an emotional break down by BOTH of the MCs, Yuzu and Mei alike. And this continuously happens throughout this excruciating series. None of the characters get any sort of punishment, chastisement, NOTHING to even point out that their behavior is predatory and wrong by any of the other characters, mostly because the two who are doing it to each other are stepsisters and have come to terms with the fact that is just a part of their sisterly relationship. But the point still stands, sexual assault should not occur this often in anime where it is glossed over and used as a plot point to further the story.But I digress, and I shall continue to my next qualm with this anime. Due to this show’s status as a romance anime, it is, naturally, going to be character-driven. Character-driven shows usually aren’t hard to pin down. As a writer myself, I find it much easier to create character-based stories, especially if I am writing romance. But the characters, in a character-driven story, need to, you know, have character. Firstly, let’s discuss Mei Aihara, the chairman’s biological granddaughter and, to put it simply, the most fucked-up character of this show. In the first episode, she kisses Yuzu without explanation after it is revealed that they are going to be living together because of her mather’s remarriage to Mei’s father, and Yuzu confronts her about her romantic relationship with their teacher that she witnessed. Mei claims she is clueless because she has not been kissed, so she shuts her up with a big ole, unconsented smooch, leaving Yuzu writhing in confusion, but also arousal as it is portrayed. But this doesn’t stop here. Oh no, there is still more incest to come. At the end of the third episode, Yuzu visits Mei after she has been taken away by her grandmother due to Yuzu’s embarrassment of the family name, and while they are having just sisterly “come back home” talks, Mei throws Yuzu on the bed and rips her top open, beginning to cry as she attempts to make physical contact with her stepsister. And then, more simple things, she calls her father “professor” because he teaches her so much, she can’t make up her mind about what she wants to be with Yuzu. She never shows emotions and is constantly leading the characters in this show on, just to throw them off when push comes to shove. Mei Aihara needs HELP, this character is irredeemable. The only redeemable character, to be frank, is Yuzu’s best friend who has to put up with all these character’s bullshit, props to her.For my final point, I’m going to touch on something that this anime contributes to on a wider scale, harmful LGBTQ+ stereotypes, especially towards women who are attracted to women. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll say lesbian. Lesbians are constantly suffering from the stereotype of being called predatory, promiscuous, or just sick and messed up in the head. So for this show to just come out of the water with lesbians who are sexually assaulting their stepsister is frankly appalling. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community myself, this show genuinely makes me sick at my stomach because the people who watch this without being aware of those stereotypes are going to take it at face value and think all lesbians are like the girls in Citrus. This show is hurtful and harmful to lesbian representation in anime, and the folks over at Studio Passione need to learn from their mistakes.Was there anything good about this anime? Other than the animation, I can’t think of any. The pure idiotic writing of this show sucks the life out of you as you watch it. I binged it, and I can honestly say, do not binge this show. If you want to watch it and get it out to the way to laugh how bad it is, then do it, but take caution cause this show is downright awful in so many ways. I hope to see this show in the dictionary definition of these words: problematic, dreadful, sickening.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Class S Romance most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer\'s head. There\'s also Yuzu\'s gyaru outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Adrienne Rich\'s lesbian continuum, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they\'re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Citrus truly ARE idiots- of...course they wouldn\'t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Yuzu\'s queer feminist catchphrase ""If I want to do something, then I will,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Sartre\'s French drama No Exit. I\'m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Saburouta\'s genius wit unfolds itself on their screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂And yes, by the way, i DO have a Citrus tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

One day we were at a restaurant together and while we had ordered different foods, we all ended up with mashed potatoes as a side. However, we all ate them differently. Danielle, who doesn\'t like flavor, had them plain. Annie liked pepper, but not salt. Melanie didn\'t like pepper, but loved salt. I loved salt AND pepper.After we were done eating, I turned to Melanie and gave her a sweet kiss, with tongue. You see, Melanie was my...girlfriend, and she\'s also my sister. Danielle and Annie rolled their eyes at us, the whole ""this again"" thing, as we had our fun. You see, salt strengthens us, so when we eat salt, we kiss, and it magnifies our power. We\'re also super gay lesbians, so combining salt with yuri is an astounding combo.Years later, Melanie - who is my sister and wife (sometimes I call her ""Wifester."" She doesn\'t like it) - and I, Florete, were lounging around the house being gay when we discovered this anime called Citrus. It starred lesbian sisters similar to us and was generating mountains of salt all across the internet. Loads of yuri and a mountain of salt? We\'ve never felt stronger!Yuzu is like me.

Thank you, internet voice.', 'Citrus is a yuri romance manga that started in late 2012 and just recently ended. Although it looks like a second manga called Citrus Plus is planned. I don\'t know if it\'s going to follow the same characters nor have I read the manga. Early this year the studio Passione, also behind Rokka no Yuusha, aired a twelve episode adaptation to cover the first part of the story. So, let\'s see how that went.Story:Aihara Yuzu finds her life turned topsy turvy when her mother suddenly remarries and the pair relocate, forcing her to enter a new school. Things turn awkward immediately when she unknowingly breaks...the rules and finds herself afoul of the young student council president. She returns home for a surprise, she has a new step-sister and it\'s the same student council president she met earlier, Aihara Mei. To make matters even more awkward, she finds Mei really attractive.Let\'s start with the problems with the series. There are two major ones. The first is that, like Love Stage, it doesn\'t have a great first impression. I will say, to Citrus\'s credit, it isn\'t nearly as bad since the initial encounter between Yuzu & Mei involves a stolen kiss and not attempted rape but it\'s still not a great way to begin a romance. The big one, however, is more reminiscent of the bad episode from Sasameki Koto. In that episode, we had a young girl act deplorably only to be instantly forgiven with no real consequences and her behaviour was never mentioned again.Citrus has the same type of thing with a character named Matsuri except her actions are even worse and they span a couple episodes. She\'s introduced about halfway into the series and decides to try and seduce Yuzu. But first she needs to deal with Mei, which is where the deplorableness comes in. Now, I\'m not opposed to having an antagonistic character who\'s absolutely atrocious as a person but the problem here, and in the aforementioned Sasameki Koto, is that they try to treat the characters as sympathetic. And that doesn\'t work when you have characters act this horribly. Not without a lot of time and effort put into redeeming them. Which neither series does. Their plots end and they basically say they\'re sorry and get told not to do it again and that\'s it.Moving on to the positives, I\'ll give Citrus credit for having romantic content between siblings in a way that\'s only mildly sleazy, and that\'s entirely based on the stolen kisses early on. Because it makes sense for two high school kids who are suddenly tossed together as step-siblings to still be attracted to one another. The series also does feature some strong scenes. Some of them are quite funny, and usually involve Yuzu making an ass of herself. While others have a bit of an awkward tension betwixt Mei & Yuzu with enough positivity to make them kind of sweet little moments. The best part, by far, is the whole arc with the twin sisters, Sara & Nina. Those three episodes are where the series gets elevated to fantastic. It\'s funny because it goes from the low point of the series, with Matsuri the sociopath, to the high point with the twins and it\'s kind of hard to believe these were written by the same person.Characters:I\'ve already covered the basics of what\'s wrong with Matsuri\'s character and the handling thereof. Needless to say, she\'s the worst character in the series by a wide margin. As for the other characters, there are aspects of Yuzu, Mei and their budding relationship I really like. The awkwardness has verisimilitude. Yuzu\'s conflicting feelings of wanting to be a good sister but also being greatly attracted to her new step-sister is compelling. Mei\'s desire to be needed and her drive for exceptionalism versus her uncertainty over how to proceed is also good stuff. But then there\'s the way things are initiated betwixt them and the way it gives a poor first impression. Harumi is a fun character. Sara is a sweetheart. I also really like what little we get of Mei\'s relationship with her wandering father. So, quite a strong cast with one very notable exception.Art:Here\'s one area where I have to give Passione a lot of credit, their artwork is really great. The characters are well drawn. The backgrounds and various world objects look good. The animation flows smoothly. It is a good looking series.Sound:Our main heroines are voiced by Taketatsu Ayana & Tsuda Minami, two strong actresses who deliver fantastic performances. We\'ve also got Kubo Yurika, Kanemoto Hisako, Fuji Yukiyo, Matsuzaki Rei and some others who are really good at what they do. Even Izawa Shiori, voice of the worst part of the series, doesn\'t perform badly. She just got stuck with a shit character. Takahashi Ryo put together a strong soundtrack for the series.Ho-yay:In addition to the obvious budding relationship betwixt Yuzu & Mei, Mei\'s childhood friend blatantly has feelings for her. Yuzu has some kind of flirtatious moments with Harumi but a lot of that is Harumi teasing Yuzu after seeing her yuri manga. Sara\'s whole arc revolves around her developing a crush on Mei who she refers to as ""her destiny."" In short, this is one of those series where the only important straight character seems to be Yuzu\'s mum. And I wouldn\'t exactly be surprised if the latter part of the manga introduces her female ""friend"" who seems to always visit while her husband\'s away. Which he always is.Final Thoughts:There are plenty of things to like about this series. The last arc especially. Unfortunately, it\'s really weakened by those three episodes heavily featuring Matsuri & by having the relationship begin in a poor way. Would I watch a second series? Well, yes. This may well be like Sasameki Koto\xa0where the manga gets past the point that made up the seventh episode of the anime and it just stays consistently fantastic afterwards. In which case, the bad part\'s out of the way. But, by the same token, this isn\'t a good yuri series thus far. It manages to average out to being decent but there are plenty of better ones out there. I\'ll give the first series a 6/10. If they do come out with a second one I\'ll give it a go but I\'m not really going to go out of my way to go through the manga or anything like that. the rules and finds herself afoul of the young student council president. She returns home for a surprise, she has a new step-sister and it\'s the same student council president she met earlier, Aihara Mei. To make matters even more awkward, she finds Mei really attractive.Let\'s start with the problems with the series. There are two major ones. The first is that, like Love Stage, it doesn\'t have a great first impression. I will say, to Citrus\'s credit, it isn\'t nearly as bad since the initial encounter between Yuzu & Mei involves a stolen kiss and not attempted rape but it\'s still not a great way to begin a romance. The big one, however, is more reminiscent of the bad episode from Sasameki Koto. In that episode, we had a young girl act deplorably only to be instantly forgiven with no real consequences and her behaviour was never mentioned again.Citrus has the same type of thing with a character named Matsuri except her actions are even worse and they span a couple episodes. She\'s introduced about halfway into the series and decides to try and seduce Yuzu. But first she needs to deal with Mei, which is where the deplorableness comes in. Now, I\'m not opposed to having an antagonistic character who\'s absolutely atrocious as a person but the problem here, and in the aforementioned Sasameki Koto, is that they try to treat the characters as sympathetic. And that doesn\'t work when you have characters act this horribly. Not without a lot of time and effort put into redeeming them. Which neither series does. Their plots end and they basically say they\'re sorry and get told not to do it again and that\'s it.Moving on to the positives, I\'ll give Citrus credit for having romantic content between siblings in a way that\'s only mildly sleazy, and that\'s entirely based on the stolen kisses early on. Because it makes sense for two high school kids who are suddenly tossed together as step-siblings to still be attracted to one another. The series also does feature some strong scenes. Some of them are quite funny, and usually involve Yuzu making an ass of herself. While others have a bit of an awkward tension betwixt Mei & Yuzu with enough positivity to make them kind of sweet little moments. The best part, by far, is the whole arc with the twin sisters, Sara & Nina. Those three episodes are where the series gets elevated to fantastic.

For one, since it was 12 episodes long, I knew it would end in the shittiest arc possible. I hated it in the manga, I hate it here as well. Second, the adaptation was close to perfect, unfortunately the presentation of certain scenes were overly expressed more than it needed to be. With the 90% Rape and the 10% Consent, I felt a need, a need to think about this again.Let me get this straight, as of right now, I enjoy the manga. The latest chapters started spicing things up. However, since the anime...adapted such a crappy arc in the first place, there comes no surprise to when I say that I hated the second half of the anime.Citrus is a Yuri manga that decided to show up after a long time since its announcement. It’s one of those series where you say “fuck it, there’s yuri.”When I first made my review, I gave it an 8, simply for the fact that I’m biased towards yuri and am basically obligated to watch it for such a reason. But knowing the fact that it goes downhill once the second half begins, just enjoying it for the “yuri” doesn’t become something I say often.The first half is what you call exceptional, a girl goes to an all-girls school where her mom remarries and her step sister turns out to be someone of important. Thus the encounter captivates her and gives her the green-light to pursue such a love. But can such a love succeed when all Mei can do is use her hands for anything but love. I understand her situation, I get that her only way of communication can be through sexual acts, but when this continues for a long time with little to no change throughout the series, it makes it harder to take her seriously each time.I appreciate the mature-ish tone that the anime decided to take, but each time they try to make it “impactful,” the actual effect decreases each time they attempt this. I also disliked the fact that they try to drag out the story but putting *ahem* “antagonists.” The first time Matsuri showed up, I was pissed, but thankfully later on she redeemed herself a little bit and became more tolerable. Now when Nana and Sara showed up, oh boy I was attempted to drop the manga there and then. Even though Sara and Nana didn’t stay within the main focus for too long, I just disliked the fact that they’re practically insert characters to prolong the conflict as long as possible.But of course, not everything about Citrus is bad. The art for the anime looks just about the same as Uta’s drawings, which I do appreciate. The voice acting was superb, each seiyuu fulfilled the role perfectly and captured the feelings no matter the circumstance or situation. The music and opening song were fantastic since I appreciate the stuff nano.RIPE makes. The animation was fine but the CGI near the start of the series was really off-putting. Thankfully, this occurs less as it goes on. Those were really my two cents of the series. I didn’t hate everything about it, but boy did it get annoying to watch later on.Citrus as an adaptation did well. It followed the panels and it showed almost every detail. Unfortunately they extended scenes that were not needed. Even if it didn’t drive off from the original source, there are things that must not be added. It was quite a shame that it ended off at one of the worst arcs possible, however if you do have the time to read past where the anime ended, then I suggest you would. The manga does get somewhat better, but don’t expect it to be amazing. I am enjoying it thus far now. I do have one pet peeve however, I hated, and I mean hated the way they adapted chapter 8’s kiss scene (out of love). That kiss was one of the best in the manga, and it looked awkward and weird on the anime. That’s just me being picky though.Citrus succeeded in terms of adaptation, but failed in all other aspects. Although it falls flat, I must say that Saburo Uta did one thing right…Making Harumin one of the hottest characters in existence. adapted such a crappy arc in the first place, there comes no surprise to when I say that I hated the second half of the anime.Citrus is a Yuri manga that decided to show up after a long time since its announcement.

It\'s not a work of art or a musical masterpiece, it doesn\'t rely on dynamic aesthetics to hook you. That said the art and sound really aren\'t bad; just don\'t expect to much from them, and let them do their job quietly. I feel like the presentation of the characters is a bit exaggerated and clunky, but at the same time it\'s probable the original subtlety of certain(especially Mei\'s) expressions would have been quite hard to replicate in animation without risking...being overlooked. The cliffhangers kind of annoy me, but that\'s probably just impatience, and although I\'m being especially critical I actually have hopes that this will gain enough recognition to be continued. In the end, this is just a story about a girl, who meets a girl, and how the shit hits the fan. Please enjoy it!(Before watching this anime I was pretty nervous, as I\'m a big fan of the original, but know as a yuri, and with therefore a comparatively small fanbase, this wasn\'t likely to get the best funding and quality. It was hard to tell much from the PVs aside from the art style, which, although isn\'t as elegant as in the manga actually turned out alright. I\'ve seen this anime get bashed quite a bit already, which is disheartening, but I decided to watch it anyway.)Story.There are some slight changes here and there, but so far pretty minor details. I feel like there are a lot more awkward moments than in the manga, but maybe that\'s just because in the manga I could take my time wincing at Yuzu\'s cringes ^^"". The episodes are definitely big on cliffhangers, and the original drama in the plot is worthy of korean TV, so if you don\'t like that then please don\'t hate on it, Citrus just probably isn\'t for you - otherwise you will become hooked, as Saburouta is ruthless!Art.The art, as I mentioned before, isn\'t anything special, but actually I think it\'s been adapted pretty well in the simplification for animation, and it\'s good and consistent, which is a relief. The animation itself seems to be masquerading as a high visual anime (the kind that shows hair shifting in the breeze) but is somewhat clunky, as though it could use more frames for the most fluid movements, and clearly takes shortcuts with layers occasionally, however it\'s not too bad either. Not something you\'ll really notice after a few minutes.Sound.Um, there\'s no way around it, I was seriously underwhelmed by the OP.((side note - not to mention the fact that in the opening sequence alone there are probably more kisses than in the first two or three books together... I can see why people are bashing this as fan service now (this isn\'t the only instance, first example is what should be sudden proximity is now extended groping :/ ??) That makes me kind of sad, because we\'ve now seen everything before we\'ve even begun, and it takes the thrill out of the romance - anyone who has read the manga will know what I mean, because in the manga actual kisses are preciously rare to start with (we\'d get like, four a year, seriously war rations for fangirls T^T), and each one represents new progress in their relationship. Well anyway, whether you\'re about fanservice of not, this isn\'t an ecchi, so don\'t expect it.))Also, I never expected Yuzu to be that bad at singing ^^"" but honestly it\'s not that out of character, so I\'ll let it pass. The ED was better, although it wasn\'t amazing.((there is a montage of what seems to be blatantly collaged original art and new sketches, or maybe it\'s just a careless impression of Saburouta - the faces are good, but in some images pretty much everything else is botched?? It\'s just the ED though.))As far as Seiyuus are concerned, well, it didn\'t strike me like ""Oh my god, that\'s Yuzu!"" but it\'s not terrible either, although it reminds me of Louise from Zero no Tsukaima. Mei\'s voice seems a bit high in pitch, and even a bit too mature, which was unexpected considering she should sound mature(maybe it sounds aged?), but it\'s pretty much the same as Yuzu\'s in terms of whether it fits the character. Harumin\'s is also a bit mature, but honestly I think it fits best of the three ^^""Characters.For newcomers the main characters are pretty much polar opposites - Yuzu is bright and loud, headstrong, righteous and optimistic. She\'s also quite simple, she desperately wants to fall in love, and her dream is to be a caring housewife. Mei on the other hand is depressed and systematic, tending to accept what is expected of her, without much passion for anything, aside from running the perfect school. I\'m sure you\'ve guessed already, but Yuzu\'s kind and candid, if somewhat idiotic nature slowly starts to warm and heal Mei\'s heart. I mean slowly. That heart is a glacier so deep in the antarctic the penguins could huddle there all winter. But Yuzu\'s pretty oblivious in some ways, so she goes and ploughs ahead anyway ^^""As the story progresses we meet new characters, each with their own problems and personalities, and bring something for the girls to learn in order to move forward.If I\'m comparing to the manga then Mei is probably more expressive, or rather, her expressions are less subtle, and the transitions between her cool and not cool aren\'t exactly smooth as a result, but she\'s still generally a very taciturn character; Yuzu...well I think you get a stronger sense of her airheadedness and childish side? The only other character we\'ve met properly so far is Harumin - Harumin is perfect imo, and fits exactly where she should as Yuzu\'s support (and that unavoidable rogue ship) - it\'s also nice to see the contrast of her make up when she goes out with Yuzu.I feel a bit like the importance of Yuzu\'s mother isn\'t shown very well in the anime. In the manga it\'s clear how much Yuzu cares about her mother\'s happiness, but it\'s not so clearly understood, which is a shame, because that part of Yuzu\'s character is probably one of the things that isn\'t just ""typical gyaru"" that everyone immediately labels her - don\'t get me wrong newcomers, she\'s definitely dressed for it, but she has various reasons, which include wanting to be beautiful, but hearing her side it becomes such that she doesn\'t feel like such a 2D character (no pun intended ^^"").Enjoyment.Although I can\'t exactly say this is the height of anime, maybe because I wasn\'t expecting much from this anime I can definitely enjoy it, I\'d recommend this to my friends, and unless something drastic happens I\'ll definitely keep watching. I\'m hoping of course that the anime stays on track, and that I can keep seeing my favourite yuri come to life.

I\'m hoping of course that the anime stays on track, and that I can keep seeing my favourite yuri come to life. I can\'t believe I\'m caught on a cliffhanger when I already know the plot!', '(TLDR Review below, as always, thanks for reading)There is a distorted mindset in every corner when it comes to Citrus.It is an anime that simultaneously holds titles of being lowbrow fetish bait for those looking for none other to satisfy their lust for girls\' love, there is also a minority who will dismiss such perspectives as a mere defect of the cognitive thought of analysing an anime (lol). I stand between the two pillars of the bridge, or one could say that I don\'t even stand on the bridge at all, for in my eyes, Citrus is none other the same as any romance anime...issued to the public, the only difference is that it uses a more niche GL as a premise than the otherwise standard heterosexual relationships which usually dominates mainstream romance anime.I\'m not one to entwine the ability of anime directors to supposed S-tier literature writers of the past such as Dumas and Dickens, however, I do believe that any piece of media can assume to the realm of subtle intellectual ideas ranging from a wide variety of field of studies, though, human irrationality is very much a thing that cannot be cured, and we have a tendency to think up nonsense that amasses to something that didn\'t exist in the first place, or such ideas that if some entity references parables and the likes it must suddenly mean said piece of fiction of the acme in a means of ""intelligent thinking"". It is one of the reasons I am not entirely impressed with anime such as NGE because the motives of each individual can be aligned with many pieces of media of today. The only weight it holds is a class act, which, I will admit, is very praiseworthy. Maybe it is that of the subconscious seeking the enjoyment maxima, I wouldn\'t know, I am no psychologist.This idea to take prey for minuscule detail is one of the reasons why I didn\'t find any reason to ""overpraise"" Citrus as I thought I would. I did initially come into this thinking it would be a nice challenge of the mind, but as time continued, there was simply no reason for me to excessively hound down on literally oxygen particles in an attempt to praise it like some Victorian doctor receiving new evidence debunking ghosts. There just wasn\'t that kind of impact. However, on the flip side, as stated in the early paragraph, Citrus was bound to not only some irrational praise, but also bound to inconsistent hate, this idea that an anime can be automatically bad based on the very same premise it was proposing. I\'ve never liked this idea because it denies the basic creation of art rights, to limit something just because someone else may not like it. It is against creative freedom if anything. The fact that no one will take the time to look at ""pointless kisu-kisu scenes"" and then brush them off as some negative factor of the anime is nothing short of absurdity and a little hypocritical to concurrently say said thing has no value in the anime, but has value in the analysis, considering these scenes happens frequently, you\'d think that there is some meaning to it rather than it being there just for the ""fanservice"".And so, with that, I bring forward what is it about Citrus that should share its place amongst the crowd as just another one of those series that comes and goes.What I really like about Citrus, and what differentiates it from the rest to give it its own name rather than solely being generic, is the idea it uses consistently. It is a tidy mess of things around this anime, with more factors being more praiseworthy than the others, but overall the writing and the presentation of such is pretty damn good. What Citrus does is that it presents different kinds of emotional conflicts between individuals in a basic, but splendid manner. Sisters being conflicted on what one thinks about the other, linearly increases acts of sexual conduct falling under forbidden acts among sisters, connections between different individuals who quake the relationship in hand. There is a lot of emotional play here, and it is written to a substantial degree. There is more intricate stuff like the kissing and what else goes on that are very interesting to understand too. As stated, I don\'t think it falls under zenith quality levels of works, but it is still somewhat a clever idea, which I believe falls into how one undergo the feeling of love. It is not all sunflowers, but instead, a thorny rose, if anything, it is a believable aspect, especially when going into a more controversial topic. This idea is that love is not always a walk in the park, rather, a fight against the many obstacles in the way of whomever it is one desire, a fight within oneself too. The dangerous thorns must be overcome for one to reach their glory, it is a reminiscence of the sweet, sour, and bitter tastes of the past. It is. Citrus. It is a clever idea for sure, all in all. However, one thing that annoyed me with Citrus was the layout.Now I know teenagers aren\'t the brightest of the bunch, we cringe at ourselves when we look back to the times of being one of the ""cool kidz"", or how the world hated us and everything was their fault, or just actual stupid nonsense (some of which was fun to be fair). So I find no reason to dislike any of the characters here doing dumb stuff, such is a part of life. My problem is the frequency of these characters, those who come and go only exist to push the main two to the ending everyone already knows will happen. Sure, as individuals, they are cool, generic yes but that doesn\'t make them bad, though they cannot have a reason to exist if it wasn\'t for the main two. It kills humanity to them, killing any and every standalone feature, thus not having the believability in range to make them more loveable characters, one can only assess their behaviour, but otherwise, there is nothing more to them than to otherwise be the spice in the plot necessary to forward the duo to the desired outcome. I suppose that may be the role of a side character, though I\'ve seen side characters elsewhere who are certified for positions in making themselves their own anime because they have that kind of good character to themselves, so there is no real excuse here, in dramas at that too.I should speak of the main characters before moving to the next section too. Starting off with Yuzu, I personally enjoyed a lot about Yuzu, and I thought to myself, when the anime had ended, that she is a great character in what she does. She is a dumb teenager, who gets dragged into the perplexing pinball world of emotions, trying to find out exactly what it is she needs to do to satisfy herself, or her emotion of love. She doesn\'t go through the most grandiose development, but I don\'t think that is a means to deny her any praise, for her strength is journey altogether. Yes, nothing really changes, but actually seeing her visibly trying to understand what it is she needs to do is nothing short of a good motion in direction. She does very questionable things, but also tries to behave in a sane manner to actually understand herself, you know, the talking to others and what have you, all the while putting in the effort necessary to maintain who she is as a person, being a kind and upbeat girl. There is none of this disjointed development that literally makes zero sense. She is a character I managed to look back only positively, I really mean it, her growth isn\'t entirely visible, but I seriously liked it when looking at the long term.Mei is a more interesting one, who is in the very same position as Yuzu, they are both coherent to one another, the only difference with Mei is that she is influential, her impact on others is part of the reason why this series is what it is, for that, she plays her role well. There isn\'t a lot to go on about the girl, she is closed about herself and tends to not be the most expressive, her troubles, however, are quite the interesting ones, and despite how she is presented, she can boil down to how others behave too, she just took a route she thought was best for her in life, which is a lot different to others, but that is not her core at heart. Even though she is very much human, Mei is presented as a very lost girl, she is disturbed of what it is love should be due to lack of experience on her behalf, it is seen countless times that her conduct simply isn\'t the right way to behave, yet she only does so because she doesn\'t know better. It is a simple detail, but it makes her more human and something maybe others can relate to, just not as dramatically. I wouldn\'t imagine there is more to her than that misguided life, for she isn\'t some kind of ridiculous enigma too. I suppose I enjoyed Mei\'s presence, and although it seems like she is an emotionless enticing individual with nothing more to her than some horniess, one must not forget what she has gone through in the anime.All in all, Citrus is very good at its narrative. It doesn\'t have the strongest or most bewildering elements to show off, but it is certainly not one that falls into the general consensus of it being hated for reasons I cannot fully commit myself to. It is a little deep, but plausible, and it is something I quite enjoyed the themes of. Many will be quick to call it uncomfortable as a means to dislike what it is that is presented, but that kind of narrow-minded behaviour doesn\'t allow for one to heed the thoughts behind in the first place. It is sad, but such happens. I suppose Citrus is a little citric to all that taste it then. As it should be ironically enough.For a Winter 2018 anime, it is just about hitting the bullseye of ""good"" production. The values here are as clean as the key visual at hand. Polished characters, good animation, you can see the effort has taken place where effort would otherwise be discarded generally. There weren\'t too many moments where a scene looked half-hearted, all around, everything was really good. I suppose the actual design of the characters wasn\'t unique, but that is the only criticism I can think of if you can even call it that. Nothing wrong with stagnated standards, you just need to ornament or go all out if you wish. Truth be told, for the audio side of Citrus, there wasn\'t much of value. Sometimes it would feel like a remix of the main theme would play over some scenes, other moments would fly right over as audio I could not possibly hope to have a lasting impact on me. Seiyuus did as well, as they should, so there isn\'t too much to comment on that. If I really wanted to, they managed to leave a good idea of the tone of Yuzu and Mei, but that was about it. Nothing else to speak of.So, I enjoyed Citrus, chances are you probably won\'t, but I made this review because making reviews are somewhat interesting as well as maybe it could provide some insight as to why this anime isn\'t as bad as people make it out to be, it is also nothing I would consider to be something only intelligent people can understand. Really and truly, it is an average romance SoL anime with some very believable and interesting main characters, so not enjoying this would be a little strange, even if presented a little different, assuming you are a fan of SoL romance. Most of what they did can have an enjoyable effect in that participating in the journey with them is entirely worth the while for sure. There are also some wholesome scenes that happen here amongst the chaos.I don\'t have any universal guide for the ranking of absolute enjoyment, but I advise one to look at Citrus not in a way that brings forward offensive content, but in a way that is actually trying to understand what it is and why it is people do such ""unbelievable"" facts, overstepping the boundary of thought is also not advised.----------TLDR Review:Story - 8: A great idea and clever way of representing such ideas presented, the direction, however, especially with characters, are a bit undermining, otherwise it is really good.Visuals - 7: Actual absolute good visuals for its time. Clean characters and everything had some effort into it.Audio - 6: Not exactly the best, stale and forgettable at times, but nothing actually bad. Seiyuus can leave an impression on Yuzu and Mei tho.Characters - 8: Very good characters who are very believable, they go through some questionable phases but it is all an understanding process. Side characters aren\'t the most interesting themselves tho.Enjoyment - 7: Quite enjoyable. The idea was nice and everything was really well thought out, enough to look back in a positive manner. Probably not enjoyable if you have a closed mind.----------A long overdue finish in watching this, but I got there in the end. Citrus is pretty good stuff. I tend not to dislike a ton of anime anyway. It was pretty obvious as to why this was hated, but I have an open mind. Have to say, it is much better than Bloom into You tho, and I am saying that as a person who, as of this review, has read the superior version of the more acclaimed series compared to watching the inferior version of the more criticized series.Both are still *sometimes* wholesome tho. Anyways, would recommend this, it is good for what it aims to present but it is a little disconnected in the ideas presented, for it is just an everyday romance story slightly derailing against the norm. A story based on a matter of understanding as well as a story of girls\' love.Also, watch Candy Boy if you like Citrus.Overall - 7.43 (7) issued to the public, the only difference is that it uses a more niche GL as a premise than the otherwise standard heterosexual relationships which usually dominates mainstream romance anime.I\'m not one to entwine the ability of anime directors to supposed S-tier literature writers of the past such as Dumas and Dickens, however, I do believe that any piece of media can assume to the realm of subtle intellectual ideas ranging from a wide variety of field of studies, though, human irrationality is very much a thing that cannot be cured, and we have a tendency to think up nonsense that amasses to something that didn\'t exist in the first place, or such ideas that if some entity references parables and the likes it must suddenly mean said piece of fiction of the acme in a means of ""intelligent thinking"". It is one of the reasons I am not entirely impressed with anime such as NGE because the motives of each individual can be aligned with many pieces of media of today. The only weight it holds is a class act, which, I will admit, is very praiseworthy. Maybe it is that of the subconscious seeking the enjoyment maxima, I wouldn\'t know, I am no psychologist.This idea to take prey for minuscule detail is one of the reasons why I didn\'t find any reason to ""overpraise"" Citrus as I thought I would. I did initially come into this thinking it would be a nice challenge of the mind, but as time continued, there was simply no reason for me to excessively hound down on literally oxygen particles in an attempt to praise it like some Victorian doctor receiving new evidence debunking ghosts. There just wasn\'t that kind of impact. However, on the flip side, as stated in the early paragraph, Citrus was bound to not only some irrational praise, but also bound to inconsistent hate, this idea that an anime can be automatically bad based on the very same premise it was proposing. I\'ve never liked this idea because it denies the basic creation of art rights, to limit something just because someone else may not like it. It is against creative freedom if anything. The fact that no one will take the time to look at ""pointless kisu-kisu scenes"" and then brush them off as some negative factor of the anime is nothing short of absurdity and a little hypocritical to concurrently say said thing has no value in the anime, but has value in the analysis, considering these scenes happens frequently, you\'d think that there is some meaning to it rather than it being there just for the ""fanservice"".And so, with that, I bring forward what is it about Citrus that should share its place amongst the crowd as just another one of those series that comes and goes.What I really like about Citrus, and what differentiates it from the rest to give it its own name rather than solely being generic, is the idea it uses consistently. It is a tidy mess of things around this anime, with more factors being more praiseworthy than the others, but overall the writing and the presentation of such is pretty damn good. What Citrus does is that it presents different kinds of emotional conflicts between individuals in a basic, but splendid manner. Sisters being conflicted on what one thinks about the other, linearly increases acts of sexual conduct falling under forbidden acts among sisters, connections between different individuals who quake the relationship in hand. There is a lot of emotional play here, and it is written to a substantial degree. There is more intricate stuff like the kissing and what else goes on that are very interesting to understand too. As stated, I don\'t think it falls under zenith quality levels of works, but it is still somewhat a clever idea, which I believe falls into how one undergo the feeling of love. It is not all sunflowers, but instead, a thorny rose, if anything, it is a believable aspect, especially when going into a more controversial topic. This idea is that love is not always a walk in the park, rather, a fight against the many obstacles in the way of whomever it is one desire, a fight within oneself too. The dangerous thorns must be overcome for one to reach their glory, it is a reminiscence of the sweet, sour, and bitter tastes of the past. It is. Citrus. It is a clever idea for sure, all in all. However, one thing that annoyed me with Citrus was the layout.Now I know teenagers aren\'t the brightest of the bunch, we cringe at ourselves when we look back to the times of being one of the ""cool kidz"", or how the world hated us and everything was their fault, or just actual stupid nonsense (some of which was fun to be fair). So I find no reason to dislike any of the characters here doing dumb stuff, such is a part of life. My problem is the frequency of these characters, those who come and go only exist to push the main two to the ending everyone already knows will happen. Sure, as individuals, they are cool, generic yes but that doesn\'t make them bad, though they cannot have a reason to exist if it wasn\'t for the main two.

A story based on a matter of understanding as well as a story of girls\' love.Also, watch Candy Boy if you like Citrus.Overall - 7.43 (7)', ""Being a fan of yuri is hard, atleast when it comes to anime. The list of all yuri shows is very, very short, and most of them suck real bad. And so every new show that resolves around such themes always gets a lot of attention. With Citrus, the expectations were big. But sadly enough, it didn't fullfil many of them.For what made Citrus so interesting to begin with is that it's the first full-on yuri show without the element of moe in a long time. Now that's not saying that I don't like moe, actually it's the complete opposite, but seeing a show that...tries to add a bit of drama and reality into it's greater themes really did lit up the fire of expectations, for both, the fanservice and the story. And the story, for the most part, is the main reason Citrus as an anime completely failed in what it tried to do.It resolves around the relationship of new step-sisters, Yuzu and Mei, who don't get along very well at the start. It's just a matter of time before Yuzu, the more lively out of the two, gets kinda obsessed with her sister and after sharing their first kiss, falls in love with her. However, Mei has a lot more admireres than Yuzu thinks and that is soon to be revealed... While the story doesn't try to be very complicated, you can't but feel that not much thought had been put into it. It it completely shallow, without a clear original idea and even though the promised drama is kinda there, it is actually the thing pushing the whole anime down. The way story develops is also very questionable, as instead of focusing on it's main couple, the anime constantly brings-up weird and non-relevant characters that somehow manage to create a fuss between the girls.Propably the best way to describe the character cast would be saying that they're just not very impressive. Starting with the better, Yuzu is not a terrible main lead. She has this outgoing and dumb personality which I was never a really big fan of, but since it's so common in RomComs I kinda got used to it at this point. There are not many positive things that I could mention about her but she's just the kind of girl that is hard to really hate. Unlike some of the other characters. For example the second main lead, Mei. Who is, by any means, a bad character as a whole. Her melancholic attitude, her bitchy assertiveness and even her forgettable design all forge a very uninteresting character whom I couldn't care less about. The way she makes the biggest poor soul out of herself while constantly mentioning her somehow depressing past, which is by the way not depressing at all, is also not a very good way of making such a shallow character look better.While the supportive cast was supposed to have positive impact on the growing relationship of Yuzu and Mei, by throwing some dramatic moments into their faces, they didn't really deliver either. There is Himeko, who started off as the biggest and most annoying Tsundere ever while also being a student coucil vice pres which is great combination indeed (sarcasm). Then there is Matsuri, who is supposed to be one of those bitch-ass characters. The problem with her is that her bitchiness is on the complete wrong side of things. I mean, comparing her to Akane from Kuzu no Honkai for example, Matsuri losses that battle on every line. She, unlike Akane, uses pretty lame tactics to get attention, her reasons to do so are not really valid and overall she just acts like a total kid. I mean, she doesn't just act, she literally is a kid. There is hope tho, and that is Harumin. Thank god for once atleast a little likeable character that saved many episodes purely by showing her friendly and funny attitude. There are also those two twin sisters who appear towards the end of the show, but since their addition worked only as another reason for Mei and Yuzu to argue and then make-up, they were pretty much completely irrelevant.I mentioned drama, right? Yes, I did. On the scale of forcing Drama, Citrus would propably rank somewhere around the likes of Kuzu no Honkai, which I mentioned already I know please don't kill me for it. Which in itself wouldn't be such a problem, if the drama was the show's only goal. The mentioned Kuzu no Honkai, for example, was undoubtedly a very over-dramatized show. However, because the drama (and sex, but these two were related) was the show's only intention from the start, it was able to take it's sweet time with it and actually make it good. Which is the main problem of Citrus. It doesn't take it's time with anything. The jumps between comedy, drama and kissing are way too damn fast and unlogical to the point where you'll never even take the dramatic moments seriously, because they were literally trying to make you laugh like half minute ago. The cycle of every episode is almost always the same too. Starts off lightly, then something occurs, then Mei gets mad, then Yuzu cries for whatever reason, then she saves the day and then they kiss. And it's like that for the majority of the show.Another area in which Citrus does terribly at is building relationship, which is something RomComs should be all about. Seeing your favourite couple coming from a blushing duo to full-on lovers mode is an important development aspect to this kind of anime. Citrus however, does it all wrong. Instead of resolving the whole story around Yuzu and Mei and giving them the time to fully develop their relatioship by themselves, the show constantly introduces new random characters that create some love drama through which then tries to continue the story. Not only this kind of appoach won't work because the ones pushing the story are not those who should, it also takes away any kind of satisfaction the moment they actually end up together, because outside of some rare moments, they just haven't had any remarkable time to set-up this kind of ending.Credit where credit is due tho. What I really liked for example are the personal changes of some characters. Himeko in particular. You see, she starts off as the biggest and loudest Tsundere ever, but as soon as she gets rejected, she redeems herself and becomes a fairly respectable character for the rest of the show. Which is a good change compared to other harem-like animes when even the characters who get harsly rejected never actually stop with their sexual intentions. I also already mentioned that Harumin was a very likeable character herself and I loved whenever she appreated on the screen.The whole yuri fanservice also wasn't very bad. Once I started ignoring the complete unlogicalness of the kissing situations, I got to enjoy them quite a lot. Though it's needles to say that there is almost no way of fucking up this sort of thing. Two girls kissing each other will always be hot. I still feel like they could've pushed the whole fanservice a bit further tho, and it's also a shame that Harumin never got any.The overall art was good, but not anything breathtaking. The scenes look polished and clean, but  little is actually animated and almost every background is just a static image. I should also add that the character desings weren't very appealing to my eyes. They were either forgettable or just not very well looking. The fact that a lot of characters were using earrings, which is a thing I hate in and outside of anime, didn't help the whole art situation either. And the sound was.. okay, I guess? I don't really know. The voice-acting wasn't the worse but I can't even remember if the show had an OST, which means it had but it was just very shallow and beyond forgettable.----Citrus had a tough task coming into anime. There are tons of yuri fans, but only a handful of yuri anime. And having to adapt one of the more popular yuri manga didn't lower the expectations either. Even though however, Citrus as an anime fails at almost everything it tries to do. It's drama is not good, it's comedy is not funny and it's characters didn't hit the spot either. It still somehow manages to make the thing we all want, that being girls kissing each other, but that is just not enough.So is the closure of Citrus, an anime that tried to bring drama into the world of only moe yuri, but failed miserably at it's quest along the way. tries to add a bit of drama and reality into it's greater themes really did lit up the fire of expectations, for both, the fanservice and the story. And the story, for the most part, is the main reason Citrus as an anime completely failed in what it tried to do.It resolves around the relationship of new step-sisters, Yuzu and Mei, who don't get along very well at the start.

There are tons of yuri fans, but only a handful of yuri anime. And having to adapt one of the more popular yuri manga didn't lower the expectations either. Even though however, Citrus as an anime fails at almost everything it tries to do. It's drama is not good, it's comedy is not funny and it's characters didn't hit the spot either. It still somehow manages to make the thing we all want, that being girls kissing each other, but that is just not enough.So is the closure of Citrus, an anime that tried to bring drama into the world of only moe yuri, but failed miserably at it's quest along the way."", 'Out of 100 Nobles watching...42 were impressed.35 got sick of the durdling plot.15 just want characters in shows to be humans acting like humans doing human things instead of weird aliens acting like what their science division determined what they think humans WOULD act like.8 would like Yuzu to have more lines of dialogue than just ""Mei!""Straight to the point.

Some of my friends got me hyped up into Citrus after how shitty that NTR Yuri anime were (Netsuzou Trap). I don\'t know if this anime adaptation just sucks compared to the manga, because my friends kept telling me that it was very good. But after finishing this anime, I\'m really doubting it. I\'ll try not to write spoilers, but you are warned.Let\'s start with the introduction: Aihara Yuzu is a ""rebel"" girl that always lied to her friends telling them that she has a boyfriend and that everything is going so great between them, after moving to...another highschool that only features girls (girl only highschool) things starts to change. The main reason why she moved was because her mother got engaged to a man whose father is the director of the school. After being scolded by many girls (of the school committee and teachers) she finds a male teacher that cheers her up. After some events Yuzu spies on that male teacher because reasons, and finds up that he is having a ""private"" time with that girl of the committee that scolded her, and this is were everything begins. I don\'t remember that much, but I believe that Yuzu after hearing some rumors about their relationship being ""forced"" she went by herself and argue with that girl (which name is Mei) and voala, Mei kisses Yuzu for no apparent reason. (This should give you an idea of how Mei is) Then after some events, her mother tells Yuzu that the daughter of her new father is going to stay at home, and what a surprise, that girl is Mei.That pretty much sums up what the first episode were. At first glance, I was okay with that, Yuzu trying to sort her feelings after knowing Mei was her sister and thinking a lot about that kiss Mei gave her. But everything goes downhill beyond this point, why? Well this anime seems to have the most retarded and generic stories ever. Each time Yuzu starts to get closer to Mei, someone appears and slowdowns their ""development"" just to spice that ""drama""(a very cringe inducing drama I must say) That serves no purpose whatsoever but to destroy their relationship where the one at fault is always Yuzu.Each episode, this show just gives me even more reasons to punch Yuzu in her face because of how stupid and submissive she is. I mean, being submissive is not a bad thing at all, it is cute in a certain way, but in this case is very infuriating and cringe inducing. Her whole personality is the same as your typical generic harem protagonist. They always want to be nice with everyone. So it doesn\'t matter if someone does bad things against her, she will stupidly smile at them and forgive them for no apparent reason. I mean, if a ""friend"" of mine comes at me full of jealousy and tries to destroy the relationship I have with someone I like, I would probably be really mad at her while leaving things clear between us, and if that doesn\'t work, nothing that cutting ties with that ""friend"" won\'t do.Even worse, Mei is a fucking bitch, no matter how excused she is, or how sad her background is, she won\'t be forgiven on my book. Each time Yuzu fucks up, Mei won\'t listen to her and will go around acting like bitch and submit herself with whoever she finds (in this case girls that comes to ""spice"" the drama), what makes it worse is that Mei harasses Yuzu each time she has the chance which is very cruel for Yuzu who is trying to reach her heart. This is were Yuzu\'s submissive being ruins everything, If it weren\'t for that, she would have move on and hang out with someone else, for example Harumin (which is best girl btw), but no, not matter how son of a bitch Mei is, Yuzu will always forgive her. And here I thought that Matsuri was the one that deserved to be hated the most, but that price goes for Mei.The Animation and Sound department doesn\'t hold any interesting to talk of.Enjoyment 6/10: Even if what I said sounded like I were dying by watching this, this anime is quite enjoyable if you forget what is happening. I mean, the fan service itself is enough for that matter if you know what I mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).Overall 4/10 (more specifically 4,4): Harumin is best girl. another highschool that only features girls (girl only highschool) things starts to change.

I tried very hard to be lenient while watching this show but it's an embarrassment. I pretty much knew what I'd rate this show as soon as Matsuri was introduced.Entirely unrealistic and the climax is a major letdown considering the ridiculous amount of plot points that came out of nowhere to add tension. Too many random makeout scenes (that are actually extremely rape-y). Matsuri is deranged, and the sexualization of her character is pathetic. Not sure where the show was trying to go with the sugar daddy subplot. Just way too many bizarre scenarios are excused and forgiven for seemingly no reason at...all aside from moving on to the next absurd thing.Very, very bad. Citrus seesaws between boring, stiff dialogue and creepy, obscene lesbian interactions. There is no in between.

It is clear that the main focus here is the relationship between the 2 main characters. We have some sidestory sprinkled here and there which is nice. It could be better, but it's enough. The drama is a bit cheap sometimes tho. The backstory is kind of superficial and character development is predictable.-ART (7-8): Art is slightly above average.

This is played up for melodrama and sparked the step-sister yuri relationship because Mei came onto Yuzu. The implications are there but LA can\'t defend this besides bringing up the catalyst to the entire relationship Citrus is built upon AND we get to know Mei for her not-so pure stoic personality. The next problem is the obvious love rivals our main yuri couple goes through TIME AND AGAIN, from Mei\'s friend and vice president of the Student Council Himeko Momokino voiced by Yurika Kubo a rival to Yuzu, Matsuri Mizusawa voiced by Shiori Izawa, Yuzu\'s childhood friend who\'s less than pure and rebelliously anti-social thus is Mei\'s rival AND finally Sara Tachibana voiced by Hisako Kanemoto who\'s in love with Mei (as a love at first sight deal) with Sara\'s twin sister Nina voiced by Rei Matsuzaki wanting to support her thus both become a rival to Yuzu. Mei and Yuzu goes through soo many love rivals both with their ""factions"" wanting Mei or Yuzu respectively and causing even more melodrama with Matsuri being the worst offender in all this, let\'s not even get to the fact that Mei\'s side of the extended family thinks nothing of Yuzu\'s family that causes LOTS more melodrama. Mei Aihara is also a huge problem to the plot itself, she being anti-social straight-headed and not ""getting social"" cues if her assaulting Yuzu by the first episode is any indication that she\'s not exactly emotionally accepting, she herself becomes her own obstacle throughout her relationship with Yuzu through the anime.Alright, so as much bitching about Citrus LA said about it, LA will now start defending LA\'s flaw points now.So the entire sexually assaulting thing, well by intents and purpose LA sees this lazy writing but it does at least shows Mei as an emotionally stunted individual who really doesn\'t know about love or can\'t portray it besides sexually as that\'s all she really knew before meeting Yuzu due to her own personal and family problems dealt to her does make her rather relatable, LA isn\'t necessarily saying that just because she\'s relatable now means Mei is a good character but LA does see more than that besides ""sexually assaulting step-sister"". Now the melodrama surrounding the majority of anime from the rival love interests to family coming in to try and stop or split up their relationship, well for rival love interest though this element comes up ALOT in the anime, LA does see what it meant to do, make either Mei and Yuzu develop together be it individually or through their relationship to get to know them a bit better in that respect to show that Mei and Yuzu love each other but they just can\'t spill it, now having the rivals used MANY times does get repetitive just under differing circumstances but nonetheless the intent and purpose is there and works for the most part to improve our main yuri duo. Now the family issues are also played up as melodrama but this can also be defend using the above. Well the problem with Mei sticks for a while but LA will defend her a bit by saying that she DOES develop with all the rivals and family issues that pops up and again though she remains emotionally stunted throughout the anime, there are little moments where she does try to open up to Mei.Yuzu was LA\'s favourite character of Winter 2018, LA just can\'t explain, ohh wait, no it\'s because she\'s usually the more intentionally charming and helpful of the entire cast but struggles with her love life and when Mei arrives it just changes her and ALSO tries to help save her, where Yuzu herself soon finds herself if her love for Mei is true or not. This isn\'t helped by her voice actor Ayana Taketatsu where she herself has been really notable this Winter 2018. Harumi Taniguchi voiced by Yukiyo Fujii was also VERY likable being Yuzu\'s best friend and she helps Yuzu out like a best friend does to the point LA wouldn\'t mind a Yuzu x Harumi all things considered if Yuzu x Mei doesn\'t work out. *ahem* by all intent, LA can really see Yuzu and Mei\'s relationship bloom through their HEAVY list of trials and tribulations, some out of left field but mostly coincidental.In terms of animation by Passione, the character designs are VERY polished and extremely striking for the most part, not to mention the various outfits many of the characters goes through. The ""yuri"" moments are short and simple but the animation doens\'t skimp on the details (the only problem being Yuzu and Mei themselves), the backgrounding was decent enough but not really noteworthy, but nonetheless from all this, LA will say that the character designs are the best thing from the animation department and this is probably the first ""good trashy"" anime with decent animation behind it LA has seen.And on speaking of those ""yuri"" moments, yes Citrus does have some *ahem* titillating moments but the furthest it goes is skinship with kissing shown more often than not (and LA doesn\'t mean the kissing is shown by Mei & Yuzu, it goes to the other characters as well). You\'d think LA would be disappointed by this however the implications and some titillation IS there, it\'s just masked ALOT of the time by the melodrama that ensues earlier or later before the fanservice that DOES detriment the scene but still the intent is there.The voice acting, well this anime ALSO has a plethora of idol-esque voice actors backing up this anime cast and uhh did the ADR Director do it intentionally with Love Live and iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls alumni known for their yuri fanbase like having Ayana Taketatsu (which felt like another meta-joke at Ayana herself but this time she\'s the OLDER sister), Minami Tsuda, Yurika Kubo and Rei Matsuzaki. Add in Hisako Kanemoto as Nayuta Kani from last season\'s Imouto sae Ireba Ii and it felt like the ADR were in on the joke. Yeah Ayana Taketatsu easily gets best voice actor from LA, NO DOUBT. But LA would like to give a rather surprising voice actor credit to Minami Tsuda in portraying the emotionally stunted Mei.Citrus has been said to be too melodramatic and not at all yuri, but LA begs to differ as MANY yuri/shoujo ai animes like Yuri Kuma Arashi, Kuttsukiboshi, Sakura Trick and hell LA will give SOME credit to Netsuzou TRap that melodrama helps move the plot and the relationship across it\'s just HOW they do it and Citrus does it pretty much the same. LA gets that some of the audience would want more ""yuri"" moments than ""melodrama"" but be it slice of life or romance or drama genre. ""Yuri"" and ""melodrama"" for LA is synonymous with one another to one get to know the main characters through their trials and tribulations through a forbidden love and two, without the melodrama the main protagonists relationship would have NEVER grown and finally, no melodrama means no story...coincidental or not.Citrus is LA\'s second guiltiest pleasure anime for Winter 2018 (ohh there\'s a guilty pleasure anime LA found much more guiltier than this), but going by yuri/shoujo ai standards and it not being yuri trash, then yes as much as Citrus HAS ALOT of flaws from the repetitive rivals and family issues melodrama shown and less yuri moments to the main characters of Mei and Yuzu going through their own relationship issues with each other BUT LA can see beyond that to see a very good trashy yuri/shoujo ai anime with those trials and tribulations only growing the main relationship, a likable main protagonist of Yuzu and some interesting characters like Harumi and some good rivals to Mei and Yuzu to test their relationship like Himeko and Sara. Some people see it as melodramatic trash, LA sees it as good yuri trash and better yet, this is one of LA\'s hyped anime of Winter 2018 that actually followed through with flaws and all. by Ayana Taketatsu.

It’s a terrible depiction of any sort of romance. Frankly I’m just disappointed the manga is just as bad if not worse. But as I’m on a goal to watch all the yuri anime (and this was my first stop) I must try my best to not turn this review into an angry rant.Romance 1/10For people who want Yuri recommandations (or just a good romance recommendation) and are wondering if this is a good GL series, I can say with confidence that it is not....Pretty much all the romantic scenes are clear fetishization of a lesbian relationship (if you can even call it that) Sexual assault is treated as something that’s meant to be arousing and the relationship development between the two main characters is laughably bad. The one good point for the romance category is that there is actual physical intimacy (consensual or not) such as kissing and handholding and it’s well animated.Story 4/10In its 12 episodes, Citrus manages to fetishize every relationship  going as far as to depict scenes that are clearly sexual assault as something that’s acceptable and even romantic/arousing. I don’t even want to start about the incest (which is one of the least offensive parts) It layers on so many coats of drama that it just becomes a hilariously terrible watch. The story does develop at an alright pace for all that that’s worth. Overall the story is nothing remarkable, it’s a bad slice of life when stripped to its core.Characters 5/10The main character Yuzu is your typical gyaru character who just wants to have a good high school life until she is basically sexually assaulted by the student council president Mei, later to revealed as Yuzu’s step sister. The two main characters have ok personalities, fleshed up well enough for them being thrown into such a plot. Their interactions (outside of the sexual ones) are realistic enough. The side characters are more there to add to the drama than anything else. If they’re not part of it they really aren’t that all memorable.Animation/Sound/Voice Acting 6/10The animation is arguably the best part of this anime (not really saying much though)  not in terms of what they are animating but just in general. The sound design is very forgettable. The Voice acting was well done, props to the voice actors for actually wanting (and doing a good job) to voice in this shit show.Enjoyment 3/10If you want to watch a train crash in 12 episodes (with most of them being unimportant) go for it. If you’re looking for a good girls love series that covers LGBTQ+ topics well forget about this series and go watch bloom into you or something.

Realistic and romantic right?Character:The MC and 2nd MC are just horny individuals who due to an even hornier author, believes themselves to be in love. every other character in the anime is a plot device and the author isn\'t afraid to violate them in any matter to compensate for how severely lacking this is. I mean, the ""rival"" is a middle school girl who engages in sexual behavior and gets money from old men.** oh and said girl, was made into a straw villain (look into straw characters online) and the author pushed it so far that THOSE OF US WHO WERE DESPERATELY CLINGING TO THIS HOPING FOR A SWEET ROMANCE were traumatized.How? for half an episode we were forced to into a suspense of whether the 2nd MC was going to turned into a prostitute for old men or not.seriously? wtf...It\'s bad enough that the characters in this anime run around forcefully kissing and molesting people like as if it was the norm. It was difficult enough tolerating a character set whose morals seem to be as if they were raised at a brothel.Art:This was horrible too, proportions would be what you would assume to be if someone was drunk while animating this. There were multiple moments where we were given an overhead view yet the characters were standing sideways, so if flipped to real perspective, they were walking tilted downwards by roughly 45 degrees.Lest we forget how in ep 1 MC wanted to put her phone in her cleavage but realized she was flat, then in her shower scene she suddenly has at leastC cups. LOGIC :Dshe appears to be average in terms of her butt too, but on certain occasions she could compete against Kim Kardashian. once again, LOGIC.Sound:Either they purposely made the VAs squeal out the most annoying sounds they could or the VAs were just as disgusted as I am about this anime and couldn\'t be bothered to try.The OP and ED aren\'t bad though, I\'ll give it that.Enjoyment:Want to get shock therapy to try and forget this shit / 10Overall:Preteen boys would be so turned on by this / 10 comes in and molests MC under the guise of ""inspection"", and for some reason this sparks her sexual and romantic interest in her.

I’d never read the manga, never heard someone mention the series at all. I just saw the picture, watched the PVs and decided it looked intriguing. I was hoping for a really juicy romance story with amazing characters and a ship I’d support for a while after. After finishing the series, I was not disappointed. Citrus was a rainbow of emotions, it’ll have you laughing at one point, in suspense seconds after, and leave you in tears (in a good way).Story 8/10: For the most part, Citrus is your generic love...story. Main protagonist meets the love interest, their emotions get sparked, struggle to comprehend their feelings, soon realize it’s love, and confess, all while the love interest is pursued by other “antagonists.” Despite this, Citrus still manages to stand out from other romance anime. Not only does Yuzu have to comprehend her feelings for Mei, she’s struggling with her first real live being for a girl, a felling she’s never experienced before (as far as I know. As I previously stated, I’ve never read the manga). While there are others who also have feelings for Yuzu or Mei, they’re all valid and (despite already shipping Yuzu and Mei) you kinda end up low key shipping it. As for yuri scenes, while there are a few there aren’t too many that distract from the story which I appreciated.Art 10/10: I loved the art style for Citrus. The colors were so bright, eye catching, and just beautiful. The artists clearly took their time to make each scene as perfect as they could. As an amateur artist myself, I’ve tried recreating these amazingly drawn characters, and can’t come close. While the general art was amazing, it doesn’t come close to the kiss scenes/ romance scenes. There was real emotion on those faces which made it easier to feel for the characters. Eye appeal is one of the most important parts of making a good anime, and Citrus nailed it.Sound 8/10: The opening was a super catchy, dancy pop song that almost perfectly represented Yuzu’s personality. Each episode you’d be dancing to the opening, and trying to sing along. The ending, while a bit calmer, also fit very well with the feel of the show. The music in the background was fitting, and was never louder than it needed to be and you could always hear the dialogue over top. The voice actors all did a wonderful job portraying the characters, and filling their character’s voices with necessary emotion.Characters 9/10: By the end of the season (hope for season 2) I loved everyone, but Yuzu and Harumin were the best from the beginning. Focusing on Harumin, she is the BEST supporting character since, well, I don’t remember. But she’s amazing. Harumin fills the series with humor from her first appearance. But humor isn’t the only thing she brings to the show. She’s an amazing and supportive friend for Yuzu and does NOT get enough credit. Yuzu’s just a perky, waaay extra child but (almost) everything crazy she does is for Mei, and that’s really admirable. I wasn’t the biggest fan of Mei at first because of some of her more, how do I put it, forceful?.. behavior with Yuzu, but after learning about her past and what goes on in her mind, it’s easier to sympathize. While I won’t go into them, the other main supporting characters, Himeko, Matsuri, Sara, and Nina are all super unique and each bring something new and important to the story.Enjoyment 10/10: If I had to pick a favorite anime of the season, I’d say Citrus in a heartbeat. I don’t usually watch anime in season, I usually wait to binge it, yet I kept up with Citrus. Citrus made my Saturdays special, and I’d be waiting all week to find out what would happen next. The time between waking up on Saturday to the new episode would often be agonizing and I’d spend the rest of the day obsessing over what I just watched. After that last episode, you’ll want to rebinge it and read the manga immediately (if you haven’t already).Overall, I give this series a 9/10. Go watch this anime now, it will be worth your time. I hope you end up loving it as much as I did, and that this review was helpful. story.

Yes, I do know that it is spelled bologna, but a dear friend of mine spells it this way, so I do as well. [Breaking news: she has recently proclaimed herself as dead, so I will continue to spell it as bolognese for the rest of my life in Memory of my dear, dead friend...]On a more serious note, the episodes themselves were very confusing. The storyline didn\'t make quite a lot...of sense as we skipped around maybe eight (8) episodes in a span of 5 minutes and jumped straight to the ending. While there were parts that made every gossip in town gasp while whispering, ""Tea......"", there wasn\'t enough substance for them to continue saying, ""Tea..................."" For instance, when that pink haired girl who looks like that other pink haired girl from dokidokiLiterature club but with a red jacket took a picture of natsumi kissing Meimei, she didn\'t do anything with the photos (or at least in the 2 seconds we saw her in the parts that we skipped to). We were severely disappointed in the tension build-up throughout this entire episode, as we are all firm believers that if your animation\'s storyboard is not entertaining in every other storyboard, then your story isn\'t that entertaining. Period. Take, for instance, Finding Dory. Each time you skip around (as I often do to see if a story is entertaining in short span of time), each scene is as exciting as the last with either a chase sequence, scenery, or general story build up to the final conclusion of actually Finding Dory.THe smear frames in the episodes were too long. With our expert OSU eyes, we easily spotted them in half a second and naturally skipped back to the scene to pause and laugh at. Although smear frames are a must for fast-paced scenes, they are not needed when that blonde girl who looked like the main character from Shugo Chara was getting groped as her water bill increased because she never bothered to turn the water off in that one scene in the kitchen. Furthermore, the art style is just. Lazy...? Like why was the dad skinny in her memories but chubby in the photo? Did they get their lore wrong? Or is Meymey\'s memories just so hazy from being so young that she forgot that her dad was actually a King DUmpling.Anyway, the actual character designs are alright. Until about 4 minutes into each episode where they introduce a new character that it looks almost exactly lik a different well-known character. I could list a few RIGHT NOW.- I mentioned this before but Natsumi looks exactly like Natsumi from DokiDokiLiteratureClub. Her pink hair with the C-shaped curls are the exact same style as Natsumi\'s along with her bangs.- There\'s a girl who looks exactly like Teto Kasane, a welll-known vocaloid. She has the same curls (drill style), but her\'s are ""natural"" apparently. We all forgot her name because she was so insignificant to the plot. Memna?-There\'s a girl who looks like Mema from Anoharana. She looks almost exactly like her and she even has a crush on her older sister, just like in ANo Havana.- There\'s probably more , but we skipped around too much to see any of the characters.Anyway, the next point of topicWOULD be the soundtrack; however, I was watching the entire thing on 2x so I didn\'t actually get to hear any of the music in the background. Furthermore, I was also laughing and playing a mobile game which ALSO was a rhythm game, so if any of the music did get out of my laptop, it didn\'t reach my ears. I\'ll rate it a 10/10And, last but certainly least, the ending. We did not enjoy it. four out of ten.I lied. I want to talk about the grandpa. Personally, I find it quite distrubing that the grandpa was preparing his legal forms for his will and such after he was hospitalized for his Meymey, but nothing in the show was ever shown talking about it thereafter. They just threw it at us and left. He didn\'t even die in the end.I also want to talk more about the ending. After discussing with my excellent consort of trusted advisors, we have reached the conclusion that the ENDIGN was ALSO bolognese. The two main pair walk off into the distance while holding hands and into a white title card that has the less-than-impressive title font in Times New Roman with a clipart of a cut orange in the background. What does that even mean. How are we, as the dedicated viewers, supposed to enjoy this show without even knowing if they have a happy ending or not. Does the grandpa ever die. Does Meyamy eveer succeed her grandpa in taking over the academy. Does her father ever come back and show his daughter the love that she needs instead of just pushing it all on his new step-daughter that he litearlly never seen before that one episode he walked in with a giant bear. Does the Mom ever get a raise after working all day and night at the construction area because we litearlly never see her. Does the two what was it called again AvoHana sisters finally break it off and find healthy relationships that don\'t revolve around each other because they are literally 10 and 13. Does the AnoHana girl ever come back to life to haunt those 6 people that killed her. Does Natsumi ever break free from  Momoka and be able to develop her own sense of personality and goals in her life even after knowing that she was born from code to fall in love with a stranger out of her own volition. We literally never find out. Chao of sense as we skipped around maybe eight (8) episodes in a span of 5 minutes and jumped straight to the ending.

But I don't understand how people are writing positive reviews for this, so I wanted to throw my two cents in. I feel like some reviews are trying to justify this shit BECOZ GAY.I understand the LGBT community is an under-represented demographic, but why don't we demand something better than the atrocities we've been receiving recently?I just want good yuri/BL anime. I don't ask for much apart from 'let them fall in love, believably, and have a relationship that works and doesn't cater to the fucking will-they-won't-they formula, PLEASE'. Bonus points for well-made romantic scenes....But I have been forcing myself through this garbage despite somehow knowing it would never improve. Whilst watching, I was completely indifferent, yet also mildly frustrated. I say 'mildly' as this anime evoked essentially nothing from me apart from the occasional hand-raise in a 'but why?' gesture.The characters, I feel, are the worst offenders - astoundingly bland and flat, and the protagonist is the only one to have the ILLUSION of a personality. Mei, in particular, is such a baffling idea of a 'character' - dull rapeygurl disguised as a dull cliche honor student. I'm sick of the more recent yuri anime doing this - one character sexually assaulting the other, questionably causing said other to 'fall in love' with them, whilst creating the most uncomfortable viewing experiences possible. We had this garbage with Netsuzou Trap, and I just absolutely despise it. I don't see how people can try and justify this sort of shit instead of demanding more established and healthy relationships.The 'relationships' between any of the characters feel forced and monotonous, and I can't appreciate any of them. The 'plot' has no outstanding substance, and there are so many contrived instances of 'but WHY did this happen, exactly?' that is emphasises how unnaturally the anime flows. The actual 'provocative' segments instead become discomforting anti-fap material, despite the obvious intention. The dialogue is boring and cringey. The art/character design is uninspired and unappealing. I don't even recall what the sound design was like.Overall, I was so bored that I felt strangely detached whilst viewing this shit.My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined. But I have been forcing myself through this garbage despite somehow knowing it would never improve. Whilst watching, I was completely indifferent, yet also mildly frustrated. I say 'mildly' as this anime evoked essentially nothing from me apart from the occasional hand-raise in a 'but why?' gesture.The characters, I feel, are the worst offenders - astoundingly bland and flat, and the protagonist is the only one to have the ILLUSION of a personality. Mei, in particular, is such a baffling idea of a 'character' - dull rapeygurl disguised as a dull cliche honor student. I'm sick of the more recent yuri anime doing this - one character sexually assaulting the other, questionably causing said other to 'fall in love' with them, whilst creating the most uncomfortable viewing experiences possible. We had this garbage with Netsuzou Trap, and I just absolutely despise it.

I definitely did cringe at this one too don\'t get me wrong (""Mei!"") - but it was a nice enough storyline to keep me enticed and wonder what would happen next. It\'s your typical slice of life anime without any insane plot, but has a storyline that you can follow easily. If you\'re looking for something mediocre then this is it. If I could give any critique it\'s that the relationship was really oversexualized (probably cause it\'s a yuri anime) but I wish it...could have been more realistic. Also, there is some non-consensual kissing. I think that producing shows like this is really great even if it doesn\'t deserve a 10/10, especially for the girls out there that like other girls. Of course, if you aren\'t willing to understand lesbian relationships you\'re probably not going to like this anime.Watch if:- You aren\'t easily offended.- you support girl on girl relationships.- you aren\'t looking for hentai.- you like slice of life.- you don\'t mind a mediocre plot/storyline.- you can withstand bold characters.Thank you for taking this review into your consideration :) could have been more realistic.

You know you shouldn\'t continue, you know it\'s only gonna get worse, you know you\'ll regret it, and yet you can\'t take your eyes off of it.  The viewing experience turns into a sort of analysis of trying to pinpoint all the ways in which the show is terrible, and articulating them.  Now that time has come to properly verbalize all these ideas for the 2-3 MAL users that will ever read these words.  Shoutout to you guys, remember to upboat.Citrus actually presents us with a pretty solid first episode....Sure, when you hear ""all girls school"" and ""student council president"", you should already have extremely loud alarm bells telling you to abort the mission. Despite that, it gave me a sliver of hope for what was to come.  It had some funny elements, and the twist of the semi-rape by the teacher spiced things up and left me wondering if this could be some kind of dark abuse story.  I could have been more wrong, but i would have had to go to great lengths, like thinking ""hey communism sounds like a dank idea"".  Already from episode 2, the downward spiral begins, and the acceleration only comes to a stop on the final minute of the last episode, when the viewer smashes into the bottom of the barrel at breakneck speed, shattering whatever was left of his sanity.Citrus boasts some of the worst writing I\'ve ever seen in any television show ever, including School Days.  The ""characters"" are just tools for the author to go through her check list of different girl-fan-service scenes.  The ""girl"" qualifier here is important.  You will get no tiddies, but you will get almost exclusively abusive semi-rape kissing scenes; because we know that\'s the only way females can get off (looking at you, 50 shades).  Every single exchange of dialog is complete non-sense, characters routinely come and disappear without any kind of explanation.  For example the teacher that was assaulting Mei in episode 1?  You never hear about him again after that scene.  Seriously.  He presented his fan service, and having outlived his usefulness, was discarded by this dumpster tier ""author"" without even a mention.This is the kind of show where conflict is ENTIRELY rooted in vapid feeling-based quarrels between the characters (see Scum\'s Wish, another prime example).  And naturally, these trivial events are being portrayed as life-changing catastrophes, and we\'re supposed to buy it.  Worry not, our precious characters will not be burdened by real issues such as poverty, violence, or illness.   X said something that made me angry!  Woe is me!  It makes you wonder, is this really how women see the world?  Is this the most touching source of drama they can conjure?The bright side is that this allows you, the viewer, to play the ""new character"" game.  The goal is simple : you have to guess when a new character will be introduced out of the blue.  Citrus makes this very simple, you know that as soon the current petty feud comes to a close, the brilliant author will run out of ideas, and copy paste some bullshit new girl.  I\'m happy to report that i have properly predicted the apparition of almost all of the characters!For instance near the end, this new character comes in.  She becomes ""shinyuu"" (close friend) with heroine A within 1 day of meeting her.  And, behold, she falls in love with heroine B within that same day, confesses to her, and B agrees to go out with her.  They have all met in the last 24 hours.  If this happened between boys and girls, it would already be completely fucking retarded, but the fact that all the interactions are homosexual drives the non-sense up to 11 and shatters any sense of reality.  I\'m willing to concede that of this extremely sloppy rushing may partly be due to the short anime adaptation.  But there is still not even the sliver of a doubt in my mind : this author is an absolute idiot, and would get outdone by the majority of teenagers writing a short story for their 9th grade English class.In light of all this, Citrus is a fun trainwreck.  The stupidity is jaw-dropping.  You won\'t be able to look away; you will want to know how bad it gets.  And when you think you reached peak absurdity, it will get dumber.  As a bonus, you have well drawn, beautiful girls to keep your eyes busy while you analyze the shitfest.This is this decade\'s School Days; truly awful, but almost a must-watch for that reason.

My second piece of texual evidence was from the christmas when Mei tried to s8x with YuzuBitch but to my displeasement they did not have fuck so Im not sure if they...are lesbians at this point.Counter Claim: Some may argue that they are in fact lesbians but according to my calculations it does not seem this way because they did not have fuk.Overall: I will have to write this anime a 2/10 because i am clueless as to whewther they are gay or what.Highly Recommand. are lesbians at this point.Counter Claim: Some may argue that they are in fact lesbians but according to my calculations it does not seem this way because they did not have fuk.Overall: I will have to write this anime a 2/10 because i am clueless as to whewther they are gay or what.Highly Recommand.', 'Let me apologize for the swearing, but that was the only way I found to describe how shitty this story is.What the actual fuck. This is the worst romance anime I have ever watched. LET ME START..... This sucks in so many levels I don\'t even know how to start.What happened about that teacher? He was there just for that first kiss scene and then completely disappear from the show after that without explanation of what relationship he and Mei had.Yuzu is a fucking stupid girl that accepts being treated like shit and still feels guilty somehow and feels like she has to do...something about whatever happens throughout the anime, she\'s just like a little puppy that has no self awareness.Matsuri literally just wanted to fuck around with their relationship, and after she couldn\'t manage that she magically changed to a ""cute prankster"" and was accepted by Yuzu and Mei.. what the fuck?That vice president girl, Mimeko, she literally kissed Mei and implied they had a deeper relationship from the past, like she was sensitive and stuff, but was never explained properly as well, what the fuck?Now, Mei.... She is just a fucking bitch, holy shit I hate that girl. She kissed everyone like was nothing literally using any people to fill her void, like Matsuri said in that episode. Played with the feelings of Sara, Yuzu, Mimeko, that random guy from the station, even her father she tried to idealize how he was in the past, taking so long to accept him as he was in the present (if it wasnt for Yuzu that wouldn\'t have happened it looks like). She acted like she deserved to be in a pedestal from start to finish in this fucking story, and when things wouldn\'t go her way she acted like a little bitch and made if looks like it was others fault... she\'s wrong in so many levels, everyone running after her like she\'s the only woman in the universe...Harumin was the only one that was a decent person in this anime, but I don\'t understand how she just popped there for plot development, and they took from there like they were best friends from ages ago...Sara helped develop the plot, but at what cost? Also, how can you fucking have a one day relationship and that be enough to understand who Mei really is? Fuck you.Sara\'s sister would sacrifice the world for her sister, at least some unique personality, but still stupid.Now back to the premise of the anime, what the fuck was that remarriage? Yuzu\'s mom remarried to a guy to not even live together? Literally just so that Mei could move into the same house and be labeled as stepsister and story could start, but no development at all on their parents story, just think about it, how convenient a husband that rarely appears just so that the Yuri factor of only girls could work in the story....After everything else, that finale where Yuzu and Mei were standing in the bridge, just made me want to take them both and throw in the river and hope they drown...Also, what is up with that school rules, they pushed the meaning strict to a dictatorship level lol, can\'t do anything in that school, but it is fine to develop relationship between the students since ""they are on fire and with lust"" as something like that was said in the earlier episodes... bruhI swear I can find more stuff to complain about this story, even if the art and sound was good, its was like polishing a piece of excrement, and treating like it was a precious gem....Overall, I hate this anime and would not recommend to anyone, not even for an enemy lol something about whatever happens throughout the anime, she\'s just like a little puppy that has no self awareness.Matsuri literally just wanted to fuck around with their relationship, and after she couldn\'t manage that she magically changed to a ""cute prankster"" and was accepted by Yuzu and Mei.. what the fuck?That vice president girl, Mimeko, she literally kissed Mei and implied they had a deeper relationship from the past, like she was sensitive and stuff, but was never explained properly as well, what the fuck?Now, Mei....

It dealt with sexually assault very sensitively and was well understood within the context of the characters. In no way does the show glorify, normalise, or excuse it. I cried a lot during this, I found it an incredibly beautiful story and the plot was well-written. It was not, contrary to popular belief, lesbian smut or fan service. This was a very realistic portrayal of adolescent confusion, love, angst, and yes sexual assault. It is unfortunately realistic that Mei felt sexual advances were her way to maintain control given her history, especially with the sexual abuse she had from...her fiancée and the events surrounding her father and having a very strict upbringing. Initially I was cautious and uncomfortable about the sexual assaults in the first two episodes, but pushing past that I could see it wasn’t just done for the sake of it.Character development was good, although not overly extensive, it did help you understand the context of their actions. Both characters were flawed in their own individual ways. The art style was pretty standard. Enjoyed the music a lot.Would recommend to anybody.

It can contain some spoilers.You know these Latin American soap operas? They just have one objective: to entertain people with a shoddy plot. Well, citrus did exactly the same.Citrus was entertaining but a garbage too.

Really, it\'s terrible. I wanted to like this show so much, I mean, it\'s one of my favorite manga, but seriously, it\'s BAAAAD.I made myself watch this since I loved the manga. The PV looked promising, I loved how the art looked, and oh my GOD, is that Yurika Kubo as Himeko?! This show was going to be my favorite of the year.As your Local Lesbian, I was quite hyped for this anime to come out, homosexual representation is always great! Ever since that first PV...Sadly, that was soon to be...quite the opposite.I\'ll start with the positives first:Art:The art is actually really, really good. I loved how vibrant Yuzu looks and how she always has a differentiating outfit every episode. The animation is also great; it looks amazingly clean in some shots, though in certain other scenes it can a little stiff. (8/10)Sound:The sound is also alright. Decent, must I say. I can\'t stand the opening, the music is great but that singer really annoys me. I was never a big NANOripe fan, so that might be a reason. Voice acting is good, as I really can\'t resist Shikaco (Yurika Kubo.) I never really found myself paying attention to the music, but it wasn\'t bad in any way. (6/10)Now now, the list of negatives...Story:It\'s quite similar to the manga, and this is something that can hold it\'s own I guess. The premise was simple, Gyaru Yuzu goes to a new girls-only high school and seito kaichou is now her little sister. They did well enough to adapt that into the anime, but it\'s still lacking from the manga. (4/10)Characters:This is where I began to hate the anime. Yuzu is so unlikeable. I understand that she\'s thrust into this unfamiliar situation and her sister is after her (and shes sorta after her sister, too), but the anime adapted it terribly. They took everything likeably-cute out of Yuzu, making her an obnoxious, ignorant brat. Mei is a bit better, but she has this whole ""I\'m going to act emo, but then, I\'m sensitive, Aubrey! Which gets me into deep shit."" I can\'t even explain how much I dislike these characters. I knew the Sekaiichi Hatsukoi anime had some unlikeable characters, but oh my GOD.The only likable character I found (without their voice actor) is Harumin, she\'s actually a really cool character. Since I can\'t give this category a 0% (MAL, please add that just for this anime), it gets 10%. (1/10)Enjoyment:I really hate this anime. I\'m most likely biased because it adapted the manga so terribly, but I hate it. On its own, it would be a solid 5/10. Instead of being a yuri for yuri lovers female and male alike akin to the manga, it\'s a yuri anime for gross dirtbags with useless fanservice and terrible characters. You can clearly see the target audience, which wasn\'t the same as the manga. But hey, at least the art is nice. (2/10)Overall: (3/10) quite the opposite.I\'ll start with the positives first:Art:The art is actually really, really good. I loved how vibrant Yuzu looks and how she always has a differentiating outfit every episode. The animation is also great; it looks amazingly clean in some shots, though in certain other scenes it can a little stiff. (8/10)Sound:The sound is also alright. Decent, must I say. I can\'t stand the opening, the music is great but that singer really annoys me. I was never a big NANOripe fan, so that might be a reason. Voice acting is good, as I really can\'t resist Shikaco (Yurika Kubo.) I never really found myself paying attention to the music, but it wasn\'t bad in any way. (6/10)Now now, the list of negatives...Story:It\'s quite similar to the manga, and this is something that can hold it\'s own I guess. The premise was simple, Gyaru Yuzu goes to a new girls-only high school and seito kaichou is now her little sister. They did well enough to adapt that into the anime, but it\'s still lacking from the manga. (4/10)Characters:This is where I began to hate the anime. Yuzu is so unlikeable.

(2/10)Overall: (3/10)', 'Let it be known prior to this review that I am yuri/ecchi/etc. trash. Of the /highest/ calibre. along those lines, this anime was practically made for me and my biases, specifically the sales pitch of a cutie lesbian innocent gyaru, I was 100% I was going to love this show, and for the first few episodes, that idea was solidified somewhat. But lets break things down somewhat to figure out why it ended up leaving me... dissapointed.-story-The story started out promising, as mentioned above. On a very superficial level, I was loving it! but from very early on there was a nagging doubt, something that...was bothering me. That doubt was how they were going to handle the various elements of sexual harrasment/forced sexual contact. it happens initally quite offhand, which made me pass it off that maybe I just interpereted it incorrectly, but then a few instances later, the show itself brings up this matter and then sort of... drops it. this was certainly one element that let to my dissapointment, since these elements can be extremely powerful literary tools! and if this show that was superficially amazing, ended up being good on a more interesting level as well, then we\'d have a really great show on our hands.Other than those elements- the story never really tries to do anything particularly interesting, beyond ""Hey look, they\'re GAY!"" which, I mean, cool. but that isnt as groundbreaking as it once was anymore. They introduced some new characters here and there, attempted to pick up the afforementioned harrasment themes and failed again.I feel like the story would have been fine if it didnt try and fail, and stuck to what it knew it could do, but I do at least commend it for trying in the first place. Nothing will ever get better if people dont try to do something new every now and again.-Art-Its really rather pretty actually. The animation isnt really anything to shout about, but the style is quite nice, and the end cards are really cool, with a more artsy style that would make a wonderful desktop background. Props to whoever the artists where for that- Im gonna have to look them up actually...-Sound-Very little too say about it honestly. The OP by nano.RIPE was pretty good, the vocals reminded me a little of HSoTD\'s OP, which I also liked. The rest of the soundtrack was, forgettable, at least to me.-Character-I /love/ Yuzu. She\'s pure and kind and waaaaaaay to easy to take advantage of sadly. But sadly most of the rest of the characters, to me, are just very bland. Mei has a chance of being interesting- with the attempted stoicism, and the strong but flawed character archtype is an interesting one, but I feel she is criminaly underused as such, I can name, maybe two instances where the elemnts of her character that /are/ intersting are used effectively.The side characters are just that, side characters, and in contrast to shows with a great supporting class (AssClass being a fantastic example) these side characters serve to spark 1 interesting interaction between the main couple, and very little beyond that. As literary devices, they\'re fine.-Conclusion-Overall, I feel this show was a severe case of missed potential, its perfectly enjoyable as a generic Yuri, but its failed attempts at being more than that leave a sour taste in my mouth. I respect it for what it attempted, but in terms of my own enjoyment, I can\'t say it really appealed to me, certainly not as much as I had initially hoped.I think I can recommend it if you are a hardcore Yuri fan, but not so much if otherwise. was bothering me.

This is the kind of show that I can watch eating snacks, drinking my tea and enjoying how events are progressing.The character growth in this anime show is fairly good. Especially the way how Mei interacts and handles the events going on around her, from feeling the need to isolate herself from her close ones in the sake of not wanting to bother them to the point where now she's more considerate about her newly sister's feelings and thoughts approaching the situation...without wanting to give false signal or misreading the situation.On the other hand Yuzu, energetic go-getter kind of person, isn't sure about her sexuality since she was always attracted to boys, trying to solve the problems that occurs between her and Mei, taking sudden acts for trying to do everything to be closer to her new sister and transforming herself from non-considerate selfish girl into a potential reliable romance partner.The show is enjoyable to watch after a long day and that's why I like the show. without wanting to give false signal or misreading the situation.On the other hand Yuzu, energetic go-getter kind of person, isn't sure about her sexuality since she was always attracted to boys, trying to solve the problems that occurs between her and Mei, taking sudden acts for trying to do everything to be closer to her new sister and transforming herself from non-considerate selfish girl into a potential reliable romance partner.The show is enjoyable to watch after a long day and that's why I like the show."", 'So, before I start this, I’d like to mention that I only watched this because of the memes. I’ve never really been into this kind of show -I’ve never watched a hentai before- and it probably would’ve completely passed me by if it were not for /r/Animemes.Now, into the proper review. I went into this optimistically, I know it involved two lesbians and was a yuri, but I thought I should watch it so I’d know why it was in so many memes, and because I might enjoy it. But, I didn’t. I suppose I enjoyed the first few episodes, but I constantly felt like...I was doing something wrong by watching this, it was almost like feeling guilty in a way, and this only got worse as I saw more of it. In fact, it’s actually the reason why I dropped the show. When I saw that episode 7 was out I went to watch it, but I couldn’t really watch it and enjoy myself, I felt like I shouldn’t watch it and it felt overpoweringly wrong, so I gave up on watching the rest of the show and dropped it.But, It’d be wrong for me to give this anime a bad review, it is a good anime, the art is well done, the characters are detailed, the special effects are mostly great, and  some of the 3DCGI suprised me with their quality, and I definitely enjoyed some parts of it. The problem for me is the plot.I don’t want to spoil it, so I won’t say too much, but this anime is definitely a yuri. I was shocked to find lesbian sexual harassment happening in the first episode and lesbian sexual assault by the third. I personallly think that that’s the problem I have with this anime, the fansevice and sexual scenes, while clearly designed to interest the viewer and in some cases turn them on, didn’t have that effect on me. If it was normal lesbian relationship then yeah it probably would of, but Citrus has the opposite effect on me because the characters are litterally sexually assaulting each other within the first the first few episodes, and that’s a huge turn off for me.Overall, I’m going to give this anime an average score, because while it is a good anime that people can enjoy, I clearly aren’t the target audience and as such I didn’t enjoy this anime.

The title lies, there are no citruses over there.To be fair the only good thing is that, it is yuri. I'm serious the story was 12 episodes of frustration with characters that simply can't make up their minds. When more characters get involve into story it gets even worse. I dunno why but when I should cheer up for main protagonist I simply can't because she's too annoying.If you want watch this I assume because the yuri part, but even that part could be better.Side characters are simply meaningless because they come and go without much input, I mean...they make some but it matters only because protagonist is a moron.To sum this up, if you want watch it, do it. It's just 12 episodes, right? 12 episodes of mediocre characters (a seriously frustrating main one), decent story (tbh story is so simple that it isn't awful but isn't good either) and pleasant to watch art. Oh and there is yuri stuff too, but not too much, to be fair Citrus is enjoyable only because yuri/gay scenes. they make some but it matters only because protagonist is a moron.To sum this up, if you want watch it, do it.

Lets start by saying that this anime is in the genre Shoujou Ai and won\'t be for everyone and it was definitely an interesting watch._Story 8/10 : The story in this anime revolves around the relationship between two teenage girls named Yuzu and Mei. Due to the marriage of Yuzu\'s mother and Mei\'s father they end up living together as step-sisters. Because of this they have a relationship that is not simple at all and with their feelings it gets even more complex. A lot of the show consists of Yuzu dealing with her inner demons and asking herself...questions such as ""what do i want/need?"" and ""what does Mei want/need?"". The pacing was very good in the beginning of the show (ep 1-8) but near the end of the show it became slightly more frustrating to watch because of how Yuzu handles situations so poorly. The story is pretty unique and it was refreshing to watch. I give it an 8/10 instead of 9/10 because of the bad pacing near the end and because of a certain character but I shall go into detail on that in the character section._Art 10/10 : The art in this anime was outstanding and it was one of the best I have watched in a while. In the first episode when I saw Yuzu with her makeup on it looked really weird to me and I really disliked it. However she ends up not wearing any so that was good (for me at least). The character designs in this anime were so good. The way each character looks different from one another was very nice to see because of how many anime I\'ve seen where the girls all look the same. One of the best things about the visuals in this anime was the characters eyes. Mei\'s purple eyes just look so awesome and the colours of all of the school uniforms and hair looked superb as well. The background art was also very good in this anime and at some times looked almost like it was filmed instead of drawn. I give the art a 10/10 and the only negatives were how the lips looked kind of strange and Yuzu\'s makeup was just so weird to look at._Sound 6.5/10 : I give the sound in this anime a 6.5/10 because it was not anything special but it was also not bad. Like most anime it was just there and forgettable. However the music never seemed out of place and the opening was not that bad as well._Character 7.5/10 : The characters in this anime were really the deciding factor in its success or failure. Lets get into the important ones.Aihara Yuzu - Yuzu is one of those characters in anime that is overall liked and she doesn\'t seem to have any real downfalls other than being somewhat dense. She is always trying to understand what is going on in Mei\'s head and she is usually unsuccessful which gets frustrating at times. Overall a pretty good protagonist.Aihara Mei - Mei is another character that seems to be one of your general anime stereotypes at first (the cold tsundere/princess), but you will quickly realize that she has many reasons to do the things that she does and her depressing backstory added a nice touch of drama. She is not honest in her words or actions at all which leads to many situations that could have been avoided which is annoying at times, but its a part of her personality so it wasn\'t that bad. Her character added a nice sense of darkness and also realism as well.Mizusawa Matsuri - All I can say about Matsuri is that she was by far the worst part of the show. The only purpose she served was to halt the progress of Mei and Yuzu\'s relationship. She has a twisted personality and is unreasonably mean. Her part in the show was very annoying to watch._Enjoyment 8/10 : Overall this anime was very enjoyable for me. It has a nice mix of drama/darkness and those heartwarming moments. The ending was very good as well and no strings were really left untied. The  supporting characters were pretty good and were not overused which was good. One thing about this show is that often times the way that Mei and Yuzu force themselves on each other can be somewhat disturbing to watch. When I say ""force themselves"" I\'m not talking about raping each other or anything like that, but they steal kisses from each other and its sometimes uncomfortable to watch. The characters don\'t really get phased or traumatized by it so it doesn\'t have a real everlasting effect._Overall 8.4/10 : In conclusion this anime was very good and the art in this show is so good that I would say its worth a watch just to view the art. The story and pacing was pretty good and it was resolved nicely. Overall this show gets a 8/10 from me and I don\'t know why it has such a low rating on MAL. questions such as ""what do i want/need?"" and ""what does Mei want/need?"".

Citrus may very well be the most popular yuri manga to date, both in Japan and in the west, just look at MAL’s popularity rankings for proof of that claim. Though highly anticipated by the audience keeping up with the series’ bi-monthly schedule, the anime was announced alongside a similar manga series named Netsuzou Trap, which bore a… less than satisfactory adaptation in Summer 2017, ultimately putting the yuri community on edge...as we hoped this would be a success.Did Citrus manage to live up to the hype?It is no secret that I am a manga reader of Citrus, and since I first picked up the manga series, I have been nothing but a loyal fan of it, and I’ve cherished it so. That was two or three years ago, and even reading the manga now, I am proud to say it stands among my favorites, even though I am well aware that it isn’t perfect.But before I get into this review, I want to tell everyone reading this review to please read through to the end, or just read the end if you can’t be bothered to slog through all of my feelings towards this adaptation.Let me reiterate; At the bottom of this review, I want to address everyone who was watching this adaptation during Winter 2018 or afterward, manga reader or not. There is where I will share my deeply personal feelings towards this adaptation of Citrus, Citrus itself, and the anime community as a whole.*This review contains minor spoilers, but the ones that are important I only mention in passing, so chances are, you will forget or not understand the context behind them enough to ruin your enjoyment. Read at your own risk, but there really is none.PRODUCTION (animation, character designs, music, backgrounds, voice acting, etc.): 7Let’s get the most superficial aspect of this review out of the way first- I say “superficial”, but in reality, this may be the most important part of both Citrus and this review. The project was helmed at studio Passione and directed by Takahashi Takeo (Spice and Wolf, Yosuga no Sora, Rokka no Yusha), and while indeed there is a lot of passion to be seen in this production, you don’t even need to read the manga to say that this anime looks inconsistent, tipping the lines between beautiful and downright ugly.Though I don’t want to keep relying on the manga for comparisons in this review, I have to because quite literally the soul of Citrus and its appeal lies in its outstanding artwork, drawn (and written) by the talented SubaroUta.But more on the importance of this distinction later.First off, the character designs are a hot mess. Well, actually they are actually quite beautiful when the animation is consistent, or they’re not moving, or when they’re not blushing! Seriously, I don’t know whose brilliant idea it was to have the blushes be this bright pink that just doesn’t meld with the character designs at all. I’m not a professional artist, and the fan arts that I did a year and a half ago, have more organic-looking blushes than this!Honestly, the blushes look cheap at best and ugly/ cheesy at worse, but that is the furthest thing wrong with the character designs. Though upon first examination (of the trailer, mostly), I felt that the designs for Citrus were meant to animate better by simplifying the designs in order to keep them consistent- it turns out that isn’t the case. The designs on their own will hold, but they aren’t the least bit consistent, especially for the dramatic moments (why?????).These two problems on their own may seem like a problem all anime has to face, but this inconsistency easily becomes poison for Citrus. Scenes that were supposed to be gut punches to the viewer or just have a lot of tension are killed by the lack of consistent art and animation. Scenes where Yuzu and Mei are supposed to be really attracted to each other, shows neither of the characters looking attractive!Scenes where Mei is supposed to have a densely emotional moment, or that Yuzu is supposed to feel inspired or serious, the art fails to communicate these feelings to the audience through its artwork, at least not like the manga did.I would be bashing it more, if it were not for the other aspects of the production though, however, I’m still going to bring this up later. That said, the aspects of the production that makes up where the art utterly fails are (well, the biggest aspect) the cinematography and shot composition (I’m throwing in all the big words right now).Cinematography and shot composition- especially for scenes that work up the romantic tension (or any scene for that matter) are consistently beautiful. Backgrounds and foregrounds are ALWAYS dazzling (especially the school campus and Yuzu and Mei’s house) and they always work to frame the characters in subtle ways. Takahashi Takeo really showed up some of the talents he showed back in Spice and Wolf because his techniques in visual storytelling were not only creative but manage to create a densely layered atmosphere, which compliments the equally consistent music and sound design.The music was composed by Takahashi Ryo (ACCA 13, Classroom of the Elite) and he certainly didn’t disappoint, though I’d hardly call any of them “stand out”. That said, the music is really lively when it just needs to be comical, and really somber and nerve-racking when it just needs to be tense. Really got to applaud this guy, but then we also have nano.RIPE performing for the OP which has been one of my favorite bands throughout the years to hear OPs from, and Mia REGINA on the ED.The voice acting is solid as well, we have Kirino- I mean Taketatsu Ayana giving a solid performance as Yuzu. Tsuda Minami (Yui from Yuru Yuri!) giving an equally solid performance as Mei, and all the other voice actors did a great job with their roles as well, though I would have to question the choice of Matsuri’s seiyuu. Not that it doesn’t fit her character, but it probably fits too well… Well, that’s just my preference, I guess.(I guess I just like to imagine Matsuri sounding like the stuck-up bitch she truly is, but oh well)There are some janky CGI character models in the background that look out of place, but nothing about this really affects the viewing experience, so it really doesn’t matter.Overall, the production of Citrus is inconsistent, but I’ve seen worse. Perhaps some of the complaints I threw out here will be fixed in the Blu-ray releases.CHARACTERS: 8Okay, enough singing praises for people you may or may not care about, instead, I want to look at the characters of Citrus. In technical terms, these characters are more or less the same as their manga counterparts. The only differences being that in the anime, the director takes some liberties and adds in many flashbacks and character building moments that weren’t present in the manga, but more on that later.So, the characters are more or less exactly the same as far as how they are written... except for one.Mei.Mei isn’t as well written as her manga counterpart. But why? You ask. Don’t they share the same scenes? Aren’t their motivations the same?My answer to that is, though you aren’t technically wrong—unfortunately, this is where the consequences of having lackluster art and animation come in. Excuse me for referencing the manga once again, but please bear with me because this will be the last time I go in depth with it before giving my final thoughts.Mei’s character, unlike every other character in Citrus, is brought to life by her art (in the manga). This is an undeniably crucial aspect of her character that the anime didn’t get right whatsoever.That is because, unlike all the other characters, Mei is more often silent and doesn’t know how to express her emotions clearly. But thanks to SubaroUta’s brilliant artwork, she can catch the subtleties of her expression even in the most undetailed of scenes. It really gives off the impression that Mei is a living, breathing person- because though the writing around her character would be enough to explain the way she acts, she just ISN’T COMPELLING without it. I mean, no wonder so many anime-only watchers HATE Mei because she ISN’T being represented right. She ISN’T being drawn right. Mei IS NOT a cold bitch that needs warmth, she is a girl that acts like a cold bitch that really wants warmth but doesn’t know how to deal with others giving it to her.Mei is supposed to be an object of affection- Yuzu’s affection and lust, and we’re supposed to see that clearly as Yuzu’s eyes are the ones we are seeing the story through most of the time. So why the heck is Mei off-model most of the time, and hardly ever look sexy? Why aren’t the animators doing everything they can to catch each of her subtle expressions???But if they nearly neglected Mei’s character, then they definitely pampered Yuzu. Yuzu is so much deeper then she needs to be, adding tons of characterization and subtleties for her any chance they get. I definitely appreciate the effort put into those scenes, even if it kinda defeats the point of the surrogate protagonist that most girls should be able to relate to (that Yuzu is supposed to be).So, Mei is probably a 6/10 character in the anime. She is characterized by being stoic, cold and stubborn, but lacking in the emotional depth that made her a compelling character. They literally ruined best girl. I could go into her whole story now, but I want to save it for later. All you need to know is that whenever pain is inflicted on her, she inflicts pain on others as a coping mechanism. This is explained in the anime, but again, it is hardly compelling.Yuzu is a 9/10 character in general. She is hard-headed and stubborn, but more importantly, she is a go-getter and chases her goals no matter how hard they may seem to achieve. But more than that, she is your average girl, all she thinks about is love, and the connections she makes with others. She’s very versed in social activity, so breaking through Mei’s social barrier one unsure advance at a time makes it seem like the two were made for each other… Yuzu also isn’t dumb. She may not be academically smart, but she has a way of figuring out the deepest parts of her feelings and acting on them without reservation, even if she can get caught up in her own morals or preconceptions.Harumi is 10/10 best waifu. I’m kidding. The only role Harumi gets to serve in this adaptation is that she is moral support for Yuzu when she gets down or hung up on things. She’s more like an 8/10, but she really can’t be faulted for it though. She just doesn’t have much of a role, contrary to popular belief. That said, she is fun, funny, and has one of the greatest personalities in the series. Also, she is straight, just clearing that up for the uninformed.Matsuri… skip.The rest of the characters matter, but I don’t want to muddy up this review much further with irrelevant banter, so we’ll just say the rest of them are 8/10.PRESENTATION: 8.5This is the juicy part. In this section, I will be analyzing how the narrative is presented, and how it compliments its production.Firstly, keep in mind what I said earlier about how well shot-composition and cinematography were used in this anime (though it doesn’t always make up for the awkward artwork).As far as the presentation is concerned, compared to the manga at least, everything is much slower and subtler. This is actually a double-edged sword. For instance, because the presentation is much more dense and subtle, the narrative present in the dialogue and action become much clearer to the audience. I don’t think I thought twice about the meaning of any of the words in Citrus before Takahashi made that the focal point of the series.The problem with this is that a lot of the scenes were meant for an emotional punch in the gut, and the way the scenes are directed in the anime often deliberately try to downplay the drama and flashy character moments for denser, more [mature] scenes.The biggest shock of the anime was definitely the involuntary kissing scene at the end of episode 1. Many were disgusted at this though, calling it a “rape scene”.It isn’t a rape scene, it was literally the greatest thing the anime did for Mei’s character, along with a few other moments throughout the series.It takes full advantage of the animated medium to communicate an integral part of Mei’s character, one that we wouldn’t be fully aware of yet as the audience. That there is something seriously wrong with Mei, and whatever it is, it causes her to inflict pain onto Yuzu.It is explained later that Mei is being abused- forced into an engagement with a teacher at her school that only cares about her money; that she is undergoing massive amounts of stress being the student council president; that she has a massive burden that she is forcing herself to uphold for the sake of her family- that being the heir to the school itself; and now she is moving in with a family she doesn’t know or care about because the father she hasn’t seen in god-knows-how-long decided to up and marry some chick she never met.Now she has to deal with that random chick’s daughter who breaks the rules she has to tirelessly keep up.All of this stress culminates in this one scene, and instead of just getting a pain-face like we get in the manga, we see how hurt Mei is through the animation and stage direction.We see this scene from Yuzu’s point of view, not really knowing much about Mei’s life outside of what we see throughout the episode. Yuzu confronts Mei, she tries to pressure her by asking about the teacher she was locking lips with before. What’s interesting about this scene at first is how Yuzu uses the same social practices she’s used to, specifically the practices she’s had to endure when asked about her “boyfriend” with her friends, to pressure Mei. She’s basically acting high and mighty like she has Mei wrapped around her finger, and she laments about how a first kiss should be “magical”. Mei can’t deal with her shit anymore, and in an impulsive, yet calculated move from Mei, she pins Yuzu down and kisses her.This here is where the complaints come in, and also where the anime diverts slightly from the manga.Yuzu’s carefully placed lipstick box and other girly accessories are knocked all over the place, acting as a motif for how this kiss literally messes up her world and everything she thought she knew about herself. Meanwhile, Mei, instead of a general kiss, forces her tongue down Yuzu’s throat to teach her what it feels like. This was already a great scene, well-directed and pretty well animated, but the staff goes further by including the next scene, where she stands up- *her face bathed in complete shadow from the lamp behind her, not letting us (the viewer and Yuzu) in on her emotional state- and utters the words “That’s what it’s like”, before leaving the room.This scene makes use of so many background elements, subtle character animations, and cinematic effects to tell the story they couldn’t tell with their limited production values, and this isn’t the only time they do it too. It’s literally in every episode (especially the dramatic ones) heck it’s even in the OP, like the divide created by Mei and Yuzu’s sides of the room as they walk into frame.In actuality, the anime does a lot to further to flesh out Mei’s character (a big complaint I made before) and her past, and a lot of it is done by use of this excellent cinematography. But again, she isn’t as compelling.The pacing is consistent as well, none of the plot points, dialogue or character moments are rushed or drag on for too long, making me think this would be a much more impactful project if the production could only hold sustain itself for the impactful scenes.The anime seems to have this motto that “atmosphere comes first”, and it certainly delivers whenever the situation calls for it, with the combination of all these elements.WRITING (Minor Spoilers): 9What is Citrus about? What is Citrus trying to say?The reason this aspect is so ill-understood is thanks to the story being initially written to be fast and thrilling instead of slow and dense. However, the writing is still intact, so I want to talk about it here.So, Citrus might just be one of the most contrived pieces of yuri fiction to date (as long as we are talking about its premise). It’s as if SubaroUta wasn’t just satisfied with writing a yuri romance, she wanted to also make sibling romance (not blood-related :P), she also wanted to make an “opposites attract” romance, she also wanted to make a “social girl breaks stoic girl out of her shell” romance, she also wanted to write a romance where one girl has blonde and the other has black hair, where every girl in the series is basically a lesbian (except Harumi and Yuzu’s Mom… I think), where every girl is a sister to someone, where there are actually grown men in the series and a story that makes it seem like the weight of the world and the eyes of society are on the character’s shoulders at all times AND IT WORKS!Citrus has a very competent narrative, even if we aren’t always allowed to feel the brunt of it thanks to the anime’s interpretation.There are some flaws here and there, personally I am not that big of a fan of Matsuri and its myriad of love interests that all just happen to be female as the Yuri God waves its magical wand, but the topics that Citrus covers in its run are all explored in one way or another- at least to the extent that it should be given the type of series it is- not to mention how each topic enhances the growing relationship and *attraction between Yuzu and Mei.First and most importantly, queer (Lesbian) struggles are represented realistically in Citrus. It acknowledges how poorly misconceived the idea of a perfect, idealized romance is in both a queer context and in just in general. If nothing else, the series knows that no relationship should be idealized and furthermore, that none are perfect in an absolute sense. That said, it has so much more to say. Take Mei’s and Yuzu’s relationship with each other for instance, they start off hating each other’s guts, but they learn over time that hate and attraction aren’t too far apart. After they both recognize each other on equal standings and do their best to help each other with their problems, albeit without blatantly saying so (for Mei), the hurdles for them to get together come in different forms. Jealousy is a big part of Citrus’ central plot devices (I call it a device but it actually makes sense), and the way competition with other characters and the idea that you can only claim the ones you love for your own is to put work and effort into it, are ones that are integrated flawlessly into the narrative.Take the beginning scene in Episode 7 for example, where Mei and Yuzu are studying so Yuzu can get into the top 100 and not get expelled by Mei’s grandfather. This is the scene where Yuzu is so hung up about what the kiss meant in the previous episode that she couldn’t concentrate on her work; this scene literally exudes competition, and this is also the beginning of the arc where Matsuri, the biggest snake in the series, appears. This arc focuses on the constant threat Matsuri poses for this stable yet slow relationship between Mei and Yuzu, as she could break it at any moment if Mei didn’t try to oppose it and claim Yuzu as her own. Mei and Matsuri were literally competing for her affection.This theme also benefits Citrus as a semi-incest series, because if it was an actual incest series then the whole point would be blatantly contradictory and hypocritical. Mei and Yuzu were forced to be sisters, and there are many times where both characters are wary of their new roles in society, even though they don’t really think of each other as sisters (because they aren’t). This adds to the sexual tension because they both know they’re not SUPPOSED TO fuck their sister, but the temptation gets the better of them whenever they are alone for more than two minutes, except that beginning scene in episode 10, where Yuzu had the opportunity but chickened out at the last moment.Abuse and longing are also running themes in Citrus as well, though nothing explicit. Cas far as that is concerned, the core theme that the series tries to get across as well is that often being hurt and longing for more pain usually have a cause and effect relationship, and its only until you realize that what you were longing for will only cause pain, then you need take steps to take it on your own.But if I had to pinpoint the biggest message the show was trying to get across among the myriad of themes Citrus (anime) has yet to even explore fully, I would say that it is ultimately about learning to feel for yourself, how to feel for others, and how to reciprocate others feelings in a genuine way. This comes across even in the anime’s finale, when (*HUGE SPOILERS!) Yuzu and Mei reciprocate their feelings and start dating each other.Though we may never see any of the really good scenes animated unless the studio is passionate enough to continue on with this project (see what I did there).But I’ve been holding something back for this entire review.Citrus isn’t about connecting with others, abuse or pseudo-incest.Citrus has always been about----------------*MY FINAL THOUGHTS*:-----------ATTRACTION.Not the anime, the manga.Notice how throughout the entire review I’ve been saying how the anime is much slower and subtler, and the manga is much more emotional and fast. Many have called the manga of Citrus “melodramatic” among many others for this reason- the artwork is bold, the panel flow is solid and fast, which gives off the impression to many people that this is nothing but a melodrama that just wants to cock block the readership and create conflict for the series to attract mass-appeal.This isn’t true, on multiple levels, but where this adaptation ultimately commits its biggest sin is in failing to translate this CRUCIAL component. In failing to communicate Citrus’ greatest strength and core theme that was communicated solely through the pacing and artwork of the manga.Compare the climax of Volume 2 to the same scene in Episode 6, where Mei and Yuzu kiss for the first time in a genuine way, with neither being forced to do so. After Yuzu shows sympathy for Mei by crying for her, Mei looks to comfort her, but the next panels clearly show the intense attraction- like a spark (!), that immensely swells and releases for the first time in the series. The next thing they know they are kissing- and the manga has a brilliant way of selling the rapid intensity of this emotion as quick exchanges of uncontrollable impulses.And it isn’t only this scene- this scene was just a payoff in the massive whirlwind of emotions that transpired before it.Citrus has a tendency to redeem itself in its story structure in its last moments with massive payoffs to the seemingly meaningless endeavors that were built up every four chapters.EVERY scene is bombastic in its writing, creating a visual flair capable of even getting a gorilla looking for a banana to engage with the story and flip through its pages.Character moments and story beats, SubaroUTA has a genius way of keeping its audience engaged through the constant use of dramatic irony, tension, and authenticity.Drama and contrivance works its way into the core theme of Citrus because ATTRACTION/ LUST---is fast and thrilling (like an addiction)-is supposed to feel heavy the more it isn’t reciprocated (like the weight of the world is resting on their shoulders)-is supposed to feel like torment-isn’t supposed to make sense to the person who feels it (making it naturally confusing and convoluted)-isn’t supposed to give a sense of clarity until its climaxAttraction and lust is also a universal appeal to pathos.Without teenage hormonal attraction being the main focus of the story, it ultimately fails to inspire its audience with all the other subtleties of Citrus’ writing.Call Citrus trash for having such a shallow theme as its driving plot motivator, but if you take a step back and realize that having its focus on the hormonal attraction between two individuals is not only a valid premise for an engaging *piece of art but is also one so woefully DONE WRONG in other media, especially with LGBT couples, you realize that Citrus has more balls than any other Yuri manga, AND manages to do a 180 and fills itself with exact same meaning as the emotion it is trying to replicate.Citrus is consistent.But more than that, Citrus is mature- even if it doesn’t have the most explicit worldview. Any time that the manga looks like the writing is becoming one or two-dimensional, it reminds us of why we were drawn to the series, to begin with.Like teenagers trying to find out about the vastness of the world, Citrus poses questions, it sets up problems for itself and though there seems to be no logical answer to any of it- when in doubt follow your heart- is a trope that is constantly misused but is breathed new life when every climax arrives- building on every dramatic scenes before it to give us want we want the most- progression.No wonder why Citrus is the most popular Yuri manga right now.Citrus is a piece of work that inspires, among everything else. Love and inspiration might not be all too different, after all, they both come as a shock.For a series that focuses so much on where love begins and ends, how you’re supposed to love and what even is love- in this world where the definition of love is so goddamn ambiguous that we might cross lines without ever being aware of it- the world NEEDS a manga like Citrus.But this is where my personal feelings towards Citrus comes in. I first read this manga 2 (1/2) years ago, and I’ve been a devote follower ever since. I read it at a time in my life when I didn’t know how to act on my emotions towards others- and to a large degree I still don’t, just I am aware of it now (I’m just a slow learner).I used Yuri romance manga and anime to contextualize the feelings I had because I was too scared to face them on my own. Citrus taught me throughout the years that it’s fine to express yourself, that you don’t need to care about what others think, but most importantly it refused to let me feel comfortable. Because these emotions and ultimately life isn’t supposed to be comfortable or safe. It taught me to take risks, no matter how foolish they are, and I’ve slowly been able to adopt this in many different scenarios in my life since then. And I’ve never been happier when I did, in fact, if it weren’t for Citrus, I most definitely wouldn’t know what I want to do with my life right now.That said, this anime adaptation of Citrus lacks that same spirit in many ways. In fact, I would have been plenty more satisfied if this anime took the risk by slicing and dicing, ultimately simplifying the story of the manga and ending at Chapter 25 of the manga instead of Chapter 16. Why do I say this? Because by keeping the story intact, rather, slowing it down and keeping it intact the anime manages to completely miss the point, and ultimately miss its impact.But that opinion is of a manga reader’s.This anime is still solid overall, which segues nicely into my next point.I feel much of the viewership failed to engage with the series on its own terms.Don’t get me wrong, I made this increasingly clear that this project isn’t exactly perfect, but the hate it gets isn’t justified in the slightest, to the point that no one is taking it seriously, even when it's taking its own creative risks FOR TAKING CREATIVE RISKS.The creativity in this anime adaptation is astounding, but the viewer’s illogical reaction to it is even more so, at times. Mostly everyone is putting this anime up to an unfair expectation- that either being a mainstream or wholesome romance, one without so much taboo, or they just aren’t expecting any of the drama whatsoever and they don’t know how to cope with it (it seems like not many actually want a deep yuri romance anymore, even if they say they do).As for manga readers criticizing the adaptation, especially ones that loved the original source like me, you are also putting it to an unfair expectation by just not getting real with it. Stop idealizing the source material and using it to definitively judge the adaptation. I made comparisons to the manga in this review, yes, but I used my knowledge of the manga as a vantage point to pinpoint aspects of the production that can be called discrepancies. I didn’t use it to write it off because everything didn’t stay faithful to the original source. If I didn’t do so, I wouldn’t be able to explain how the anime’s lack of impact on the community came to be, because the writing literally isn’t fit for a slow and calculated adaptation.All the adaptation did with the writing is emphasize different points with a different interpretation, and though there were some consequences with the decisions made, you also have to realize that these points were still in the manga.Thus, you cannot criticize an intentional creative choice for being intentional. You can criticize it for all the unintended consequences, but that’s beside the point.So, did Citrus live up to the hype?I definitely enjoyed this adaptation more than any other adaptation I had the (dis)pleasure to experience as my time as an anime watcher. I acknowledge all of the errors made, but I still think this series is solid and deserves to be recommended to others… after they read the manga.I’m joking, but please be careful who you recommend it to.As for others, judging from the score, it seems many don’t exactly agree. “Oh well”, I suppose, but I really hope I convinced some people here reading this that Citrus has value and should be recognized for it.Let’s recap:Production (Art, Animation, Music, Backgrounds, Voice Acting, etc.): 7/10Characters (Yuzu, Mei, Harumi, Matsuri, Himeko, Sara, Nina, Dad, etc.): 8/10Presentation (Direction, cinematography, shot composition, pacing, etc.): 8.5/10Writing (Plot, themes, motifs, symbolism, dialogue, motives, consistency, etc.): 9/10TOTAL: 8.13/10I’m not adding my enjoyment because I think this is a reasonable enough score to give this anime, and I don’t feel like swaying it too much past objectivity.I hope everyone enjoyed my review if you have any criticisms of how I structured it, feel free to drop a comment on my profile to share your ideas with me. I just tried a new structure, so I'm not exactly sure how good it was...And with that, I bid thee a wonderful day. as we hoped this would be a success.Did Citrus manage to live up to the hype?It is no secret that I am a manga reader of Citrus, and since I first picked up the manga series, I have been nothing but a loyal fan of it, and I’ve cherished it so. That was two or three years ago, and even reading the manga now, I am proud to say it stands among my favorites, even though I am well aware that it isn’t perfect.But before I get into this review, I want to tell everyone reading this review to please read through to the end, or just read the end if you can’t be bothered to slog through all of my feelings towards this adaptation.Let me reiterate; At the bottom of this review, I want to address everyone who was watching this adaptation during Winter 2018 or afterward, manga reader or not. There is where I will share my deeply personal feelings towards this adaptation of Citrus, Citrus itself, and the anime community as a whole.*This review contains minor spoilers, but the ones that are important I only mention in passing, so chances are, you will forget or not understand the context behind them enough to ruin your enjoyment. Read at your own risk, but there really is none.PRODUCTION (animation, character designs, music, backgrounds, voice acting, etc.): 7Let’s get the most superficial aspect of this review out of the way first- I say “superficial”, but in reality, this may be the most important part of both Citrus and this review. The project was helmed at studio Passione and directed by Takahashi Takeo (Spice and Wolf, Yosuga no Sora, Rokka no Yusha), and while indeed there is a lot of passion to be seen in this production, you don’t even need to read the manga to say that this anime looks inconsistent, tipping the lines between beautiful and downright ugly.Though I don’t want to keep relying on the manga for comparisons in this review, I have to because quite literally the soul of Citrus and its appeal lies in its outstanding artwork, drawn (and written) by the talented SubaroUta.But more on the importance of this distinction later.First off, the character designs are a hot mess. Well, actually they are actually quite beautiful when the animation is consistent, or they’re not moving, or when they’re not blushing! Seriously, I don’t know whose brilliant idea it was to have the blushes be this bright pink that just doesn’t meld with the character designs at all. I’m not a professional artist, and the fan arts that I did a year and a half ago, have more organic-looking blushes than this!Honestly, the blushes look cheap at best and ugly/ cheesy at worse, but that is the furthest thing wrong with the character designs. Though upon first examination (of the trailer, mostly), I felt that the designs for Citrus were meant to animate better by simplifying the designs in order to keep them consistent- it turns out that isn’t the case. The designs on their own will hold, but they aren’t the least bit consistent, especially for the dramatic moments (why?????).These two problems on their own may seem like a problem all anime has to face, but this inconsistency easily becomes poison for Citrus. Scenes that were supposed to be gut punches to the viewer or just have a lot of tension are killed by the lack of consistent art and animation. Scenes where Yuzu and Mei are supposed to be really attracted to each other, shows neither of the characters looking attractive!Scenes where Mei is supposed to have a densely emotional moment, or that Yuzu is supposed to feel inspired or serious, the art fails to communicate these feelings to the audience through its artwork, at least not like the manga did.I would be bashing it more, if it were not for the other aspects of the production though, however, I’m still going to bring this up later. That said, the aspects of the production that makes up where the art utterly fails are (well, the biggest aspect) the cinematography and shot composition (I’m throwing in all the big words right now).Cinematography and shot composition- especially for scenes that work up the romantic tension (or any scene for that matter) are consistently beautiful. Backgrounds and foregrounds are ALWAYS dazzling (especially the school campus and Yuzu and Mei’s house) and they always work to frame the characters in subtle ways. Takahashi Takeo really showed up some of the talents he showed back in Spice and Wolf because his techniques in visual storytelling were not only creative but manage to create a densely layered atmosphere, which compliments the equally consistent music and sound design.The music was composed by Takahashi Ryo (ACCA 13, Classroom of the Elite) and he certainly didn’t disappoint, though I’d hardly call any of them “stand out”. That said, the music is really lively when it just needs to be comical, and really somber and nerve-racking when it just needs to be tense. Really got to applaud this guy, but then we also have nano.RIPE performing for the OP which has been one of my favorite bands throughout the years to hear OPs from, and Mia REGINA on the ED.The voice acting is solid as well, we have Kirino- I mean Taketatsu Ayana giving a solid performance as Yuzu. Tsuda Minami (Yui from Yuru Yuri!) giving an equally solid performance as Mei, and all the other voice actors did a great job with their roles as well, though I would have to question the choice of Matsuri’s seiyuu. Not that it doesn’t fit her character, but it probably fits too well… Well, that’s just my preference, I guess.(I guess I just like to imagine Matsuri sounding like the stuck-up bitch she truly is, but oh well)There are some janky CGI character models in the background that look out of place, but nothing about this really affects the viewing experience, so it really doesn’t matter.Overall, the production of Citrus is inconsistent, but I’ve seen worse. Perhaps some of the complaints I threw out here will be fixed in the Blu-ray releases.CHARACTERS: 8Okay, enough singing praises for people you may or may not care about, instead, I want to look at the characters of Citrus. In technical terms, these characters are more or less the same as their manga counterparts. The only differences being that in the anime, the director takes some liberties and adds in many flashbacks and character building moments that weren’t present in the manga, but more on that later.So, the characters are more or less exactly the same as far as how they are written... except for one.Mei.Mei isn’t as well written as her manga counterpart. But why? You ask. Don’t they share the same scenes? Aren’t their motivations the same?My answer to that is, though you aren’t technically wrong—unfortunately, this is where the consequences of having lackluster art and animation come in. Excuse me for referencing the manga once again, but please bear with me because this will be the last time I go in depth with it before giving my final thoughts.Mei’s character, unlike every other character in Citrus, is brought to life by her art (in the manga). This is an undeniably crucial aspect of her character that the anime didn’t get right whatsoever.That is because, unlike all the other characters, Mei is more often silent and doesn’t know how to express her emotions clearly. But thanks to SubaroUta’s brilliant artwork, she can catch the subtleties of her expression even in the most undetailed of scenes. It really gives off the impression that Mei is a living, breathing person- because though the writing around her character would be enough to explain the way she acts, she just ISN’T COMPELLING without it. I mean, no wonder so many anime-only watchers HATE Mei because she ISN’T being represented right. She ISN’T being drawn right. Mei IS NOT a cold bitch that needs warmth, she is a girl that acts like a cold bitch that really wants warmth but doesn’t know how to deal with others giving it to her.Mei is supposed to be an object of affection- Yuzu’s affection and lust, and we’re supposed to see that clearly as Yuzu’s eyes are the ones we are seeing the story through most of the time. So why the heck is Mei off-model most of the time, and hardly ever look sexy? Why aren’t the animators doing everything they can to catch each of her subtle expressions???But if they nearly neglected Mei’s character, then they definitely pampered Yuzu. Yuzu is so much deeper then she needs to be, adding tons of characterization and subtleties for her any chance they get. I definitely appreciate the effort put into those scenes, even if it kinda defeats the point of the surrogate protagonist that most girls should be able to relate to (that Yuzu is supposed to be).So, Mei is probably a 6/10 character in the anime. She is characterized by being stoic, cold and stubborn, but lacking in the emotional depth that made her a compelling character. They literally ruined best girl. I could go into her whole story now, but I want to save it for later. All you need to know is that whenever pain is inflicted on her, she inflicts pain on others as a coping mechanism. This is explained in the anime, but again, it is hardly compelling.Yuzu is a 9/10 character in general. She is hard-headed and stubborn, but more importantly, she is a go-getter and chases her goals no matter how hard they may seem to achieve. But more than that, she is your average girl, all she thinks about is love, and the connections she makes with others. She’s very versed in social activity, so breaking through Mei’s social barrier one unsure advance at a time makes it seem like the two were made for each other… Yuzu also isn’t dumb. She may not be academically smart, but she has a way of figuring out the deepest parts of her feelings and acting on them without reservation, even if she can get caught up in her own morals or preconceptions.Harumi is 10/10 best waifu. I’m kidding. The only role Harumi gets to serve in this adaptation is that she is moral support for Yuzu when she gets down or hung up on things. She’s more like an 8/10, but she really can’t be faulted for it though. She just doesn’t have much of a role, contrary to popular belief. That said, she is fun, funny, and has one of the greatest personalities in the series. Also, she is straight, just clearing that up for the uninformed.Matsuri… skip.The rest of the characters matter, but I don’t want to muddy up this review much further with irrelevant banter, so we’ll just say the rest of them are 8/10.PRESENTATION: 8.5This is the juicy part. In this section, I will be analyzing how the narrative is presented, and how it compliments its production.Firstly, keep in mind what I said earlier about how well shot-composition and cinematography were used in this anime (though it doesn’t always make up for the awkward artwork).As far as the presentation is concerned, compared to the manga at least, everything is much slower and subtler.

Many were disgusted at this though, calling it a “rape scene”.It isn’t a rape scene, it was literally the greatest thing the anime did for Mei’s character, along with a few other moments throughout the series.It takes full advantage of the animated medium to communicate an integral part of Mei’s character, one that we wouldn’t be fully aware of yet as the audience. That there is something seriously wrong with Mei, and whatever it is, it causes her to inflict pain onto Yuzu.It is explained later that Mei is being abused- forced into an engagement with a teacher at her school that only cares about her money; that she is undergoing massive amounts of stress being the student council president; that she has a massive burden that she is forcing herself to uphold for the sake of her family- that being the heir to the school itself; and now she is moving in with a family she doesn’t know or care about because the father she hasn’t seen in god-knows-how-long decided to up and marry some chick she never met.Now she has to deal with that random chick’s daughter who breaks the rules she has to tirelessly keep up.All of this stress culminates in this one scene, and instead of just getting a pain-face like we get in the manga, we see how hurt Mei is through the animation and stage direction.We see this scene from Yuzu’s point of view, not really knowing much about Mei’s life outside of what we see throughout the episode.

Meanwhile, Mei, instead of a general kiss, forces her tongue down Yuzu’s throat to teach her what it feels like. This was already a great scene, well-directed and pretty well animated, but the staff goes further by including the next scene, where she stands up- *her face bathed in complete shadow from the lamp behind her, not letting us (the viewer and Yuzu) in on her emotional state- and utters the words “That’s what it’s like”, before leaving the room.This scene makes use of so many background elements, subtle character animations, and cinematic effects to tell the story they couldn’t tell with their limited production values, and this isn’t the only time they do it too. It’s literally in every episode (especially the dramatic ones) heck it’s even in the OP, like the divide created by Mei and Yuzu’s sides of the room as they walk into frame.In actuality, the anime does a lot to further to flesh out Mei’s character (a big complaint I made before) and her past, and a lot of it is done by use of this excellent cinematography. But again, she isn’t as compelling.The pacing is consistent as well, none of the plot points, dialogue or character moments are rushed or drag on for too long, making me think this would be a much more impactful project if the production could only hold sustain itself for the impactful scenes.The anime seems to have this motto that “atmosphere comes first”, and it certainly delivers whenever the situation calls for it, with the combination of all these elements.WRITING (Minor Spoilers): 9What is Citrus about? What is Citrus trying to say?The reason this aspect is so ill-understood is thanks to the story being initially written to be fast and thrilling instead of slow and dense. However, the writing is still intact, so I want to talk about it here.So, Citrus might just be one of the most contrived pieces of yuri fiction to date (as long as we are talking about its premise). It’s as if SubaroUta wasn’t just satisfied with writing a yuri romance, she wanted to also make sibling romance (not blood-related :P), she also wanted to make an “opposites attract” romance, she also wanted to make a “social girl breaks stoic girl out of her shell” romance, she also wanted to write a romance where one girl has blonde and the other has black hair, where every girl in the series is basically a lesbian (except Harumi and Yuzu’s Mom… I think), where every girl is a sister to someone, where there are actually grown men in the series and a story that makes it seem like the weight of the world and the eyes of society are on the character’s shoulders at all times AND IT WORKS!Citrus has a very competent narrative, even if we aren’t always allowed to feel the brunt of it thanks to the anime’s interpretation.There are some flaws here and there, personally I am not that big of a fan of Matsuri and its myriad of love interests that all just happen to be female as the Yuri God waves its magical wand, but the topics that Citrus covers in its run are all explored in one way or another- at least to the extent that it should be given the type of series it is- not to mention how each topic enhances the growing relationship and *attraction between Yuzu and Mei.First and most importantly, queer (Lesbian) struggles are represented realistically in Citrus. It acknowledges how poorly misconceived the idea of a perfect, idealized romance is in both a queer context and in just in general. If nothing else, the series knows that no relationship should be idealized and furthermore, that none are perfect in an absolute sense. That said, it has so much more to say. Take Mei’s and Yuzu’s relationship with each other for instance, they start off hating each other’s guts, but they learn over time that hate and attraction aren’t too far apart. After they both recognize each other on equal standings and do their best to help each other with their problems, albeit without blatantly saying so (for Mei), the hurdles for them to get together come in different forms. Jealousy is a big part of Citrus’ central plot devices (I call it a device but it actually makes sense), and the way competition with other characters and the idea that you can only claim the ones you love for your own is to put work and effort into it, are ones that are integrated flawlessly into the narrative.Take the beginning scene in Episode 7 for example, where Mei and Yuzu are studying so Yuzu can get into the top 100 and not get expelled by Mei’s grandfather. This is the scene where Yuzu is so hung up about what the kiss meant in the previous episode that she couldn’t concentrate on her work; this scene literally exudes competition, and this is also the beginning of the arc where Matsuri, the biggest snake in the series, appears. This arc focuses on the constant threat Matsuri poses for this stable yet slow relationship between Mei and Yuzu, as she could break it at any moment if Mei didn’t try to oppose it and claim Yuzu as her own. Mei and Matsuri were literally competing for her affection.This theme also benefits Citrus as a semi-incest series, because if it was an actual incest series then the whole point would be blatantly contradictory and hypocritical. Mei and Yuzu were forced to be sisters, and there are many times where both characters are wary of their new roles in society, even though they don’t really think of each other as sisters (because they aren’t). This adds to the sexual tension because they both know they’re not SUPPOSED TO fuck their sister, but the temptation gets the better of them whenever they are alone for more than two minutes, except that beginning scene in episode 10, where Yuzu had the opportunity but chickened out at the last moment.Abuse and longing are also running themes in Citrus as well, though nothing explicit. Cas far as that is concerned, the core theme that the series tries to get across as well is that often being hurt and longing for more pain usually have a cause and effect relationship, and its only until you realize that what you were longing for will only cause pain, then you need take steps to take it on your own.But if I had to pinpoint the biggest message the show was trying to get across among the myriad of themes Citrus (anime) has yet to even explore fully, I would say that it is ultimately about learning to feel for yourself, how to feel for others, and how to reciprocate others feelings in a genuine way. This comes across even in the anime’s finale, when (*HUGE SPOILERS!) Yuzu and Mei reciprocate their feelings and start dating each other.Though we may never see any of the really good scenes animated unless the studio is passionate enough to continue on with this project (see what I did there).But I’ve been holding something back for this entire review.Citrus isn’t about connecting with others, abuse or pseudo-incest.Citrus has always been about----------------*MY FINAL THOUGHTS*:-----------ATTRACTION.Not the anime, the manga.Notice how throughout the entire review I’ve been saying how the anime is much slower and subtler, and the manga is much more emotional and fast. Many have called the manga of Citrus “melodramatic” among many others for this reason- the artwork is bold, the panel flow is solid and fast, which gives off the impression to many people that this is nothing but a melodrama that just wants to cock block the readership and create conflict for the series to attract mass-appeal.This isn’t true, on multiple levels, but where this adaptation ultimately commits its biggest sin is in failing to translate this CRUCIAL component. In failing to communicate Citrus’ greatest strength and core theme that was communicated solely through the pacing and artwork of the manga.Compare the climax of Volume 2 to the same scene in Episode 6, where Mei and Yuzu kiss for the first time in a genuine way, with neither being forced to do so. After Yuzu shows sympathy for Mei by crying for her, Mei looks to comfort her, but the next panels clearly show the intense attraction- like a spark (!), that immensely swells and releases for the first time in the series. The next thing they know they are kissing- and the manga has a brilliant way of selling the rapid intensity of this emotion as quick exchanges of uncontrollable impulses.And it isn’t only this scene- this scene was just a payoff in the massive whirlwind of emotions that transpired before it.Citrus has a tendency to redeem itself in its story structure in its last moments with massive payoffs to the seemingly meaningless endeavors that were built up every four chapters.EVERY scene is bombastic in its writing, creating a visual flair capable of even getting a gorilla looking for a banana to engage with the story and flip through its pages.Character moments and story beats, SubaroUTA has a genius way of keeping its audience engaged through the constant use of dramatic irony, tension, and authenticity.Drama and contrivance works its way into the core theme of Citrus because ATTRACTION/ LUST---is fast and thrilling (like an addiction)-is supposed to feel heavy the more it isn’t reciprocated (like the weight of the world is resting on their shoulders)-is supposed to feel like torment-isn’t supposed to make sense to the person who feels it (making it naturally confusing and convoluted)-isn’t supposed to give a sense of clarity until its climaxAttraction and lust is also a universal appeal to pathos.Without teenage hormonal attraction being the main focus of the story, it ultimately fails to inspire its audience with all the other subtleties of Citrus’ writing.Call Citrus trash for having such a shallow theme as its driving plot motivator, but if you take a step back and realize that having its focus on the hormonal attraction between two individuals is not only a valid premise for an engaging *piece of art but is also one so woefully DONE WRONG in other media, especially with LGBT couples, you realize that Citrus has more balls than any other Yuri manga, AND manages to do a 180 and fills itself with exact same meaning as the emotion it is trying to replicate.Citrus is consistent.But more than that, Citrus is mature- even if it doesn’t have the most explicit worldview. Any time that the manga looks like the writing is becoming one or two-dimensional, it reminds us of why we were drawn to the series, to begin with.Like teenagers trying to find out about the vastness of the world, Citrus poses questions, it sets up problems for itself and though there seems to be no logical answer to any of it- when in doubt follow your heart- is a trope that is constantly misused but is breathed new life when every climax arrives- building on every dramatic scenes before it to give us want we want the most- progression.No wonder why Citrus is the most popular Yuri manga right now.Citrus is a piece of work that inspires, among everything else. Love and inspiration might not be all too different, after all, they both come as a shock.For a series that focuses so much on where love begins and ends, how you’re supposed to love and what even is love- in this world where the definition of love is so goddamn ambiguous that we might cross lines without ever being aware of it- the world NEEDS a manga like Citrus.But this is where my personal feelings towards Citrus comes in. I first read this manga 2 (1/2) years ago, and I’ve been a devote follower ever since. I read it at a time in my life when I didn’t know how to act on my emotions towards others- and to a large degree I still don’t, just I am aware of it now (I’m just a slow learner).I used Yuri romance manga and anime to contextualize the feelings I had because I was too scared to face them on my own. Citrus taught me throughout the years that it’s fine to express yourself, that you don’t need to care about what others think, but most importantly it refused to let me feel comfortable. Because these emotions and ultimately life isn’t supposed to be comfortable or safe. It taught me to take risks, no matter how foolish they are, and I’ve slowly been able to adopt this in many different scenarios in my life since then. And I’ve never been happier when I did, in fact, if it weren’t for Citrus, I most definitely wouldn’t know what I want to do with my life right now.That said, this anime adaptation of Citrus lacks that same spirit in many ways. In fact, I would have been plenty more satisfied if this anime took the risk by slicing and dicing, ultimately simplifying the story of the manga and ending at Chapter 25 of the manga instead of Chapter 16. Why do I say this? Because by keeping the story intact, rather, slowing it down and keeping it intact the anime manages to completely miss the point, and ultimately miss its impact.But that opinion is of a manga reader’s.This anime is still solid overall, which segues nicely into my next point.I feel much of the viewership failed to engage with the series on its own terms.Don’t get me wrong, I made this increasingly clear that this project isn’t exactly perfect, but the hate it gets isn’t justified in the slightest, to the point that no one is taking it seriously, even when it's taking its own creative risks FOR TAKING CREATIVE RISKS.The creativity in this anime adaptation is astounding, but the viewer’s illogical reaction to it is even more so, at times. Mostly everyone is putting this anime up to an unfair expectation- that either being a mainstream or wholesome romance, one without so much taboo, or they just aren’t expecting any of the drama whatsoever and they don’t know how to cope with it (it seems like not many actually want a deep yuri romance anymore, even if they say they do).As for manga readers criticizing the adaptation, especially ones that loved the original source like me, you are also putting it to an unfair expectation by just not getting real with it. Stop idealizing the source material and using it to definitively judge the adaptation. I made comparisons to the manga in this review, yes, but I used my knowledge of the manga as a vantage point to pinpoint aspects of the production that can be called discrepancies. I didn’t use it to write it off because everything didn’t stay faithful to the original source. If I didn’t do so, I wouldn’t be able to explain how the anime’s lack of impact on the community came to be, because the writing literally isn’t fit for a slow and calculated adaptation.All the adaptation did with the writing is emphasize different points with a different interpretation, and though there were some consequences with the decisions made, you also have to realize that these points were still in the manga.Thus, you cannot criticize an intentional creative choice for being intentional. You can criticize it for all the unintended consequences, but that’s beside the point.So, did Citrus live up to the hype?I definitely enjoyed this adaptation more than any other adaptation I had the (dis)pleasure to experience as my time as an anime watcher. I acknowledge all of the errors made, but I still think this series is solid and deserves to be recommended to others… after they read the manga.I’m joking, but please be careful who you recommend it to.As for others, judging from the score, it seems many don’t exactly agree. “Oh well”, I suppose, but I really hope I convinced some people here reading this that Citrus has value and should be recognized for it.Let’s recap:Production (Art, Animation, Music, Backgrounds, Voice Acting, etc.): 7/10Characters (Yuzu, Mei, Harumi, Matsuri, Himeko, Sara, Nina, Dad, etc.): 8/10Presentation (Direction, cinematography, shot composition, pacing, etc.): 8.5/10Writing (Plot, themes, motifs, symbolism, dialogue, motives, consistency, etc.): 9/10TOTAL: 8.13/10I’m not adding my enjoyment because I think this is a reasonable enough score to give this anime, and I don’t feel like swaying it too much past objectivity.I hope everyone enjoyed my review if you have any criticisms of how I structured it, feel free to drop a comment on my profile to share your ideas with me. I just tried a new structure, so I'm not exactly sure how good it was...And with that, I bid thee a wonderful day."", ""*SPOILER FREE*. Anything about plot that I say, is shown in the first episode so I feel it's fair game.Citrus is trashy, and that's why it's my guilty pleasure. I almost hate explaining the plot to my friends, esp the ones who don't watch anime, but I got so obsessed with this show so fast that I couldn't stop talking about it. That, and I loved to see the look on their faces when I say:Story: 7/10. that it's a show about a girl, Yuzu, who moves to a conservative all girls school and falls in love with the student class president, Mei. Oh yeah,...and the class president is also her step-sister. It's straightforward, and the simplicity is nice. What is actually remarkable is that it never really resorts to cheap-and-easy drama. In shows like Grey's Anatomy and other dramas, a lot of the conflict arises from basic lack of communication, which is frustrating and inorganic. Citrus keeps things realistic within the world it has set up. The student body president, Mei, at an all-girls school is suddenly undergoing her first encounter with lesbian attraction. It's her new sister. On top of that, Mei is the granddaughter of the school's owner, and is set to inherit it when her grandfather passes on the mantle. I don't know what life is like in Japan for LGBT, but I imagine no conservative girls school would be happy about that. Meanwhile, Yuzu struggles to understand her feelings, while also building her familial and social relationships. Things get pretty zany as it goes on, but nothing ever escapes reality.Art: 10/10. I like the art style. The characters are cute and expressive. Animation is smooth. Colors pop.  A variety of environments are used as settings, but when they revisit one, it always looks familiar. I give it a 10/10 not because it's earth-shattering, but because I straight could not imagine it looking better than it does.Sound: 7/10. OP is super hype, I love it. ED is forgettable, as in I don't even remember how it goes and I've seen all 9 released so far and last watched it a few days ago. Scene music is good and compliments the mood well, but also is forgettable.Characters: 8/10. This show has few characters, but that isn't a bad thing. It makes the most of each one. You cheer for Yuzu, understand her confusion, and share her excitement. Mei is a typical tsundere I would say, but it also fits the role she plays as president. Yuzu and Mei have a few friends, and while some are well-explored, others feel sort of flat. Especially Yuzu's first friend Harumin(sp?). She's more of a cheerleader than a friend, but she's pretty much the only one like that.Overall: 8/10. Citrus is trash. It's ridiculous how much I love this show. It's not even bad; the core concept is even believable. The characters are fun, the story has enough twists and turns to stay interesting and build tension. Sound is about average (yes, at MAL, 7/10 is the median score pretty much). I love the art style though, which is what keeps me coming back to this.Now if you'll excuse me, time to rewatch eps 1-9 to prep for the new one coming out on Saturday! and the class president is also her step-sister.

I really enjoy the manga so I was looking forward to see how they will make it. Sadly, it fell short of expectations.I won't compare anime with manga but you just see the difference when you stay up to date with manga which, in my opinion, is far more better.The story is quite interesting, romance between siblings (they'r not actually siblings, they'r half-siblings) is still a taboo for many people, even when it's getting more popular in anime nowadays, so...people tend to show curiosity over stuff like this.Art: If you can't stand pinkish knees- don't watch it.

The first one is your typical gal who likes to go shopping and do makeup, she's always cheery and she makes friends easily.

As die-hard fans of yuri anime, I would say citrus is more restless than the others. while the kind like sasameki koto or aoi hana have sweet and peaceful feeling, this one busy with events and maybe over dramatic actions. of course that isn\'t necessarily bad, if anything it would be more intriguing to watch.Characters:Most people might realize this already, that some main character in romance anime usually dense beyond help. That stereotype might be used to prolong the series and delay as much as possible the conclusion audience have been waiting for (cough.. nise***)....That\'s way some anime like citrus will be nice change of pace. The main characters are honest to their feeling, and it\'s very cute to watch. the others are unique and interesting as well, some are really funny, like Harumin.Story:The story itself is good, there are no useless fillers, most of the events are related to the plot.

That alone make this interesting and intriguing. What is the solution awaiting for them, that\'s what we want to know.Sound:the background sounds are okay I guess, it bring feels at certain occurrences nicely. what I really like are the OP and ED songs, they are wonderful and really suit this show.Enjoyment:Well I would give citrus 10/10 for enjoyment, I can\'t explain it well but the flow of this anime is just feels natural for me, I enjoy every second of it, including some cheesy dialogues (well you can\'t escaped that in japanese shows). The yuri or stepsister aspects don\'t bother me at all, yeah some ""Good and Noble"" people might want to complain and harassing this anime because of that. Really, just stay away from shoujo ai/yuri things if you can\'t stand it, instead of watching just to feel bad (of course that\'s applied to any other category).

I did not read the manga so this is my first time encountering this series.Citrus is an anime about the love of two girls (yes it is about love and not lust). There is fanservice throughout (naturally) and of course it is not the type of anime that is always comfortable to watch. However, citrus is enjoyable and tells a story with somewhat original characters; even if they're not the most exciting.I'll be honest and say what's bad about this anime first. This isn’t everything...bad, or everything good but it's what I gathered so far.1. Citrus can be uncomfortable to watch. There is a lot of scenes where sexual acts are forced and it can be so uncomfortable that I look away from the screen or take out one headphone. The over sexualisation is not something that is always necessary and can put some people off watching, myself included.2. The story attempts to tackle realistic scenarios but without realistic approaches. The relationship between the two main characters sometimes simply doesn't make sense and there hasn't been significant progression yet. Either things happen too fast or too slow. I guess realistic pacing, both for character development and monologue, are not the strong points of the anime.3. THE FANSERVICE. Simply put, I hate this. Both from a personal and objective point of view, the fan service is forced and once again uncomfortable. Rather than placing these moments within the story, the story revolves around these moments instead. They aren't particularly enjoyable so it doesn’t really work as good fan service.So why do I like citrus and think you should watch it?1. IT'S NOT BORING. Sure Citrus isn't going to be the best anime that you've ever watched, but it isn't dull either. The script isn't perfect and the mix between serious and comedy is confusing but it's enjoyable nonetheless. I've had fun watching Citrus even though it certainly isn't my usual genre.2. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S REALISTIC! I just wanna stress that it is an anime not a documentary. Some things that happen in Citrus are strange or don't make much sense (like the fact that her mother didn't tell her about the step sister). Sure these plot holes take away from the overall quality but not from the enjoyment. Watch Citrus for fun and for a bit of weird drama. If you take it too seriously then how can you enjoy anime?3. It's an unusual romance. As a huge romance fan I will admit that there is no build up to falling in love. Yuzu literally goes from seemingly asexual to lesbian in a day or two. But that doesn't mean that the romance isn't beautiful. It is not a cliché school romance, so if you want that look somewhere else. Love comes in different forms and the love shown in Citrus may be different but it's refreshing.4. The art is pretty, the voices are great and the characters are easy on the eye. Visually it has been pretty well defined to make it easy to watch. I love the voice actors (especially for Yuzu) and really get drawn in by the clean visuals and fitting voices.Overall PLEASE GIVE CITRUS A CHANCE. Episode one is uncomfortable and that is a big flaw of the anime I won't doubt. However it is a romance that is different to a typical shoujo and is certainly unique in its execution. Citrus isn't for everyone, and it isn't even the best anime airing right now, but it is enjoyable and I will happily finish the season; hope you do too! bad, or everything good but it's what I gathered so far.1.

The effect drama has on the characters of the series creates depth and a human elements for the cast. With Citrus you get the chance to experience the best and worst the drama genre has to offer.

Some scenes in the anime/manga have made me cry more than the majority of drama anime out there. When the plot revolves...around the more complex aspects of the relationship between Mei and Yuzu and their family, Citrus does so brilliantly. The problem I have with the plot in Citrus is the fact that the show itself doesn’t know what it wants to be. It doesn’t know if it wants to be a sweet yuri anime focussing on the controversial relationship between two step-siblings, a series focussing on the discovering of the self, a introspective anime about the acceptance of LGBTQ couples in the Japanese society; or a really trashy show about exactly how trashy humanity can be when given in to their primordial emotions. Because of the amount of drama put into the anime simply for shock factor, the show comes off as a cheap poorly written excuse for making the show seemingly more mature. In summary the plot is brilliant but also horrible as some arcs are truly emotional and others a pain to watch (Like Matsuri’s character arc).Art – 7/10Well done Passione for creating an adaptation of a yuri manga with twelve episodes and a twenty-four minute runtime per episode which doesn’t feel like a tight budget anime. I was seriously surprised at the amount of effort given to the art, as yuri is a tiny niche with a small fan base. The character design are all pretty nice as well as the set pieces of the anime. It’s nothing special but nor is it something awful. That being said, the more intimate and romantic moments between Yuzu and Mei were really well done and didn’t feel too much like another form of fanservice to draw in a larger audience.Sound – 7/10Music design in Citrus is good, just good. There are some great tracks found in the OST which really helped in creating the atmosphere of the anime, even though they might be somewhat forgettable. The opening and ending are both really fun to listen to and I managed to watch both every single episode.  Lastly I really enjoyed the voice acting for both the dubbed and subbed version of the series. I found that the subbed version has the more professional voice acting – as usual – but I happened to like the dubbed version just as much, because I felt the English voice actors captured the characters more realistically.Character 7.5/10Yuzu is a likeable protagonist, because of her simplicity. I felt a connection with Yuzu as she is the type of character which the majority of the audience can relate towards, as the problems she deals with have been experienced by many people – regardless of their sexual orientation. You either adore Mei or hate her. The moments which captured her personality the best where those in which her reactions were the complete opposite of her character archtype, like the scenes where she tried being honest with Yuzu and those between her and her father. Even the relationship between Mei and Yuzu can be loved or hated. On the one hand you are rooting for the sweet Yuzu to have her feelings requited and Mei just to express herself better. On the other hand you might dislike the relationship between the two of them as Mei can be a giant bitch, because of her insensitivity towards her peers. Either whether you love them or hate them, their relationship is entirely subjective. Harumin in particular is a pretty fun character as she polarises the personalities of Yuzu and Mei. She made the show even more endearing as she is the type of friend you would want in your own life. Other than the above mentioned characters other characters I really enjoyed were: Yuzu’s Mother and Mei’s Father. The rest of the characters were pretty meh in my opinion as most of them served no other purpose than to get on my nerves, add more drama or move the plot forward.Enjoyment – 8/10Contrary to the amount of problems Citrus has, I personally really love the series and I love the romantic scenes between Yuzu and Mei. At times the anime is really heart-warming and sweet, and others it really gets on my nerves the amount of bullshit added to further the plot. I personally believe that the plot could have been done way better if only there wasn’t a new threat every episode.Overall – 7/10If you are looking for a excellent yuri series … then go read Sasameki Koto and The Private Report on my Personal Lesbian Experience with Loneliness. Both of these manga series manage to capture the best of LGBTQ drama. Citrus is a good anime if you are looking for those themes, but unfortunately falls short.

Whether you love or hate the series is entirely up to you. I personally enjoy it!Thanks for taking the time to read my review!', 'A wise man once said ""Repetition is the death of art"" and no quote can be more applicable than to this anime. Citrus was as expected a romance, yuri based anime with a hint of comedy and love struggles. However while the genres may be correct, the execution was at best mediocre. So join me in the review of Citrus, to see what\'s right, and what\'s not.So we\'ll compare it against another anime of similar proportions, Sakura Trick. Both feature excessive yuri, romance and kissing so I believe it\'s the perfect anime to compare it to as basis.I think that both animes did...well into making a kiss look very ""kissy"", the same sort you can find from a hentai but a bit more restraint. The slight gasp and the flustered emotions from citrus to the more quieter subtle kiss from Sakura Trick, i think they basically did first base spectecularly. Audio and design wise, citrus is clearly the winner, even besting some of the current animes in character design and maybe fall short of violet evergarden and koe no katachi, big names basically. Audio wise also felt very airy and spacious with hints of background activity rather than closed up like sakura trick.They did kissing well, they nailed the objective, give them a 10 already! Well not so fast. The issue is repetition. If this sort of detail of kissing was in a romantic anime like say koe no katachi or maybe chunnibyou, then well done 10/10. While most romance animes want to lightly sprinkle fanservice to make it as magical as possible, citrus decides to just pour the entire bottle. When kissing is done regularly and repetitively, it becomes superficial and very meaningless, very shallow. Like there is no meaning in it no matter how hard they try to express it. Sakura Trick also faces this issue but citrus did it way worse. While Sakura Trick only does it to people they truly love with specific couples set, Citrus decides that as long as that person is a girl, she\'s kissable.The height of demand is a principle I use for shipping. Koe no katachi, I want them to start dating. For couples, i want handholding. For handholding couples, maybe a kiss etc. But for citrus, there\'s not much beyond it, because beyond it is second base, and that\'s too lewd. They were not expecting it and that led to a downfall when i get bored of something and I want more but didn\'t get it.This would be still fine if there\'s other things to add to the magic of the excessive kissing. But unfortunately dear viewers, there isn\'t. At most one or two lines of comedy, the weird love ""polygon"" with very depthless drama, not even the slice of life part was done particularly well to fix the issue. Character quality wise, nothing special to add. While the main characters are ok, side characters are just jealous assholes.Citrus was a godsent. Yuri, romance, kissing. Nothing could be more perfect than these three genres together. Unfortunately while they may have nailed the genre combinations right, they simply failed in execution.Maybe it\'ll be a great drinking game. Who knows?> Wait is it me or does Sara looks and sound like Nayuta. Sneaky... well into making a kiss look very ""kissy"", the same sort you can find from a hentai but a bit more restraint.

However it has a major drawback that ( in my opinion ) prevents this anime fromentering my favorite's list.DISCLAIMER:   I am extremely picky with anime series because I'm an anime veteran.

It almost feels like watching Jersey Shore or Secret Story."", 'When all was said and done, I enjoyed Citrus, but I probably wouldn\'t recommend it to most people.The first few episodes are a real barrier and I wouldn\'t blame someone for not being able to get past it. It\'s a romance show that relies entirely on non-consensual advances (we call that ""sexual assault"" where I\'m from) to move the plot along. While most of it sorta makes sense in the context of the characters if you read between the lines, it\'s also clearly done for the titillation of the viewer, which is kinda gross. Nonetheless, I kept watching because I like yuri and thus have...no standards.However, the show makes a pretty big shift in episode 5. The main character, Yuzu, previously motivated purely by her desire to fuck her sister, has an epiphany moment, and suddenly wants to... be a good person and a supportive sister.Huh.She\'s still monstrously thirsty, but from this point forward I\'d say the main character is probably the best thing about the show. She\'s an adorable ball of awkwardness and a genuinely good person that doesn\'t deserve all the soap opera drama bullshit that happens to her. And oh man, do they ramp up the soap opera drama bullshit, and I ate that shit up no matter how cheesy it got.Citrus is an overly dramatic smutty Drake and Josh with lesbians that I would definitely never admit I watch to anyone in real life, but if you\'re into that kind of thing you could probably do worse than this. no standards.However, the show makes a pretty big shift in episode 5.

Up front: I really enjoyed the show. It was probably the most entertaining (of what I watched) this season (Winter 2018). So much so that it is the first review I\'ve written in a long time. Anyway...Citrus is yuri. So girls kiss.It is also trashy romance. So sensuality is paramount and consensuality is... well, let\'s be generous and say... ambiguous.To be fair, Citrus is not particularly amazing at anything. It is alright.Animation: fine.Character design: fine....Backgrounds: fine.Music: fine.Cast: fine.Voice acting: fine.Where I feel it excels though is in the writing. Skeptics, hold your gasps.This is tricky to qualify because whatever good is there is overshadowed by the show\'s more... polarizing aspects. I won\'t summarize the plot, you can read the synopsis for that. Instead, the best arguement I can make is by summarizing one particular scene (or series of events) that occurs towards the end of the show.This is only like 5% - 10% of the show, at best, so consider this a minor spoiler of sorts. Again, this is an arguement for why the show is good in spite of its flaws, or why it is worth watching, so if you have ANY intention of watching the show spoiler free, please do that first.Now then, beneath the smutty surface, I posit that there is an unappreciated font of talented writing at play here. Bear in mind, that no matter how good the writing, trashy fantasy just may not be for you, but otherwise, I will present this ironically long summary as evidence:==========================================================The main character, Yuzu, runs into another girl, Sara, and her sister, Nina. Sara is looking for Mei, Yuzu\'s step-sister and love interest, who had helped her out earlier when she was lost. It was love at first sight. Destiny.Yuzu helps little lost Sara (who is technically the same age) and over the time spent together, the two become fast friends. Dramatic irony ensues.Yuzu gets into multiple dumb fights with Mei during the course of the show (as happens in any relationship, semi-incestuous or otherwise) and Sara confirms her resolve to confront Mei and confess her feelings to her.Yuzu admires Sara and is supportive of her romantic endeavor but, more importantly, Sara encourages Yuzu to do the same, saying (and I’m paraphrasing): ""If there’s a chance, you have to act!”This is, more or less, the central tenet of Sara’s personality and the ultimate theme of the show. The positivity and support for each other is all very heartwarming and uplifting, despite the cliché of ""not being aware they are both in love with the same person"".Fast forward and things come to a head and then get… complicated. What Citrus did that inspired me to write this, and will stick with me for many years to come, is thus:Nina loves her sister, Sara, dearly and is concerned. Sara is a very selfless person and is always putting others before herself; sacrificing her own happiness in the process. So, Nina interferes, trying to coerce Yuzu into giving up. She guilts Yuzu into promising that she won’t get in the way, because, after all, is Sara not her friend? But… Yuzu cannot keep that promise because she still loves Mei and was convinced of one thing: to not give up.""If there’s a chance, you have to act!""Final scene; Sara and Yuzu meet. Sara tells Yuzu to go to Mei. Nina objects, but Sara has already determined it was not meant to be. It is Yuzu that Mei is waiting for.Yuzu leaves at Sara’s behest, and Nina rebukes Sara. What about your destiny?To which, Sara replies (paraphrasing again): “I was drawn to Mei and met Yuzu. Isn’t it wonderful to think that my destiny was to bring those two together?”Nina objects again, tearfully saying (essentially): “No, it’s not wonderful. What about you? Don’t you want to be happy?”To which, Sara concludes: “With a loving sister like you, how could I not be?”And so, I wiped a tear (or two) from my eyes and brought my hands together in applause.Bravo, Citrus.I don’t care who you are, that’s good drama right there.

Given that, I\'m genuinely surprised at how many poor reviews people have put up for this show. I don\'t write reviews before watching all the scheduled episodes, this one is no different, and I hope that you may just be one step closer to considering watching this after reading the following.STORY: 8The premise is simple, Aihara Yuzu, who\'s never actually fallen in love before (but pretends to her friends) is attracted to her practical...polar opposite, Aihara Mei... who also happens to be her step-sister. The story is really about how they get along, and how they fall in love with each other.The one-sided development is how I find most modern anime relationships go, where one character is madly attracted to the other and somehow they just... magically like them back one day with no rhyme or reason. You won\'t find that here, even if it seems that way at first.ART/SOUND: 8It\'s rare for me to see an anime that looks attractive, but not over-the-top flash/bang/glitter... maybe I\'m just looking in the wrong places. Given that, Citrus is very nicely animated, considering that the TV anime industry in Japan doesn\'t make as much revenue as actual licenses bought/Blu-Ray and DVD copies sold.Some scenes look anatomically odd or some areas, PASSIONE thought it a good idea to pull out the stops on kissing sound folios that just end up making it awkward but overall I\'m impressed that the production level animation looks this good for TV.CHARACTER: 9Alright, here\'s where I find a lot of reviews tend to miss the point and call the characters underdeveloped or downright undeveloped. What honestly got me hooked on this series are the characters, not the story, not the idea of yuri/shoujo-ai (girl\'s love)... but that\'s a nice bonus. PASSIONE did well to follow the anime closely to the manga frame by frame, and the storytelling style is to show, not tell.On the outside, Yuzu is one of those ""meddling teenager"" characters who\'s always up in your face, being loud and rambunctious.On the outside, Mei is one of those ""perfect"" girls who doesn\'t let anyone or anything bother her. She\'s that polar opposite, quiet, thoughtful and distanced.Mei and Yuzu feel like real teenagers, with real problems and real, but not always practical and mature ways to deal with said problems. There\'s a layer of depth to the characters that you can\'t discern from simply watching they do as a passive viewer.Yuzu is shown at the very least to be very thoughtful when she\'s not reacting to something. Mei is likewise distanced because of her fear of becoming too attached. These are things that real people do and personalities that real people develop because of things that happened to them!TLDR; OVERALL: 9The one reason I can\'t recommend this show is that PASSIONE made the intimacy almost one step too far from something that should feel nice to see, into something incredibly uncomfortable. Trigger warning for images of cringe and pseudo-assault. The ""no-means-no-means-yes"" is definitely bad for my feeling.Cringe aside, there is a reason why these characters do these things. I think character development is the strongest point of the series, and it motivates practically every side of the story. There is a reason why Mei practically assaults Yuzu in the opening scenes, which ties into her development as a character, who she is, how she perceives affection (misaffection), and her image as someone cold and distanced for fear of hurt.I recommend this show if you, like me are starved for a fictional character who if you took them out of their world and shoved them here, would behave 3-dimensionally like a real person. This is a rarity in modern story-telling.The key to understanding the world of CITRUS is not simply to know the character... but to understand them as the many-faceted human beings that they are, even if they are fictional.I do hope you give CITRUS a try. Be undissuaded by nay-sayers, and even yay-sayers like me. Please watch it if you can handle some uncomfortable moments, and develop your own opinions.That said, CITRUS is now my new favourite item of the season so send me a private message if you\'d like to elaborate on this mini-discussion about character development! polar opposite, Aihara Mei... who also happens to be her step-sister.

Please watch it if you can handle some uncomfortable moments, and develop your own opinions.That said, CITRUS is now my new favourite item of the season so send me a private message if you\'d like to elaborate on this mini-discussion about character development!', 'This anime is really a work of art, the characters are beautiful & colourful in both personality and animation the story is never slow yet does not feel rushed.

Citrus is awful from beginning to end. The way the characters act and interact with each other makes no sense, and it is an incredibly inaccurate and honestly harmful portrayal of sapphic people.At the beginning, we are presented with Yuzu Aihara. She seems like an upbeat and cheerful character, which is true, but throughout the story, she loses more and more of what made her interesting to start with, leaving us with a strange shell of a person.The reason that this dramatic change happens, is because of her step sister, Mei Aihara entering into her life. I seriously...don’t know how to start with their relationship. It’s already off to a bad start due the fact they are sisters. You can argue that ‘they aren’t blood related’ but really, the fact that they are related is only really there for the shock factor, and because of the whole pseudo-incest thing. If you move past the obvious issue of them being sisters, it still won’t improve much from there. Their relationship is founded on a lack of boundaries and there is never any form of consent to the acts they do, which leads to the scenes feeling weird to watch (as if they don’t already) and gives them a rapey feel. Literally in their first day of knowing each other Mei gropes Yuzu to confiscate her phone, and pushes her down and essentially sexually assaults her. Their relationship doesn’t improve from there, yet Mei is treated later on as a sweet girl who just doesn’t know how to express feelings other than with her body. As a concept that’s something that could be explored, but the romanticisation of her actions takes away from any opportunity for that to happen.Other than Mei and Yuzu being together, the rest of the show (which there isn’t really much of) really isn’t much better. Yuzu and Harumi’s friendship always stuck out as strange to me. They became friends right away, which is fine, but later on it just stops feeling like an equal relationship. Harumi is always there for Yuzu and lets her stay with her often, yet Yuzu is usually too preoccupied with thinking about Mei to even give Harumi a second thought, which just makes me wonder why Harumi is even friends with Yuzu to begin with. Harumi says to her something along the lines of ‘there’s nobody else to have fun with on campus’ when she meets her, so when Yuzu becomes a shell of what she once was due to Mei, why does Harumi stay with her? I’d normally understand, you know, the whole ‘friends stick together’ idea, but Yuzu and Harumi barely know each other, so why are they presented as so close?Another thing I never understood, was why the relationship between Mei and Yuzu is so readily accepted by pretty much everyone. When Sara is made aware of the nature of Yuzu and Mei's relationship as sisters, she backs off and even encourages it, in the name of 'true love'. In reality she would probably be disgusted and rightfully so.The only thing I genuinely like about citrus is the art style and animation. It looks great. Not much more to say, apart from that it's a shame that so much time was wasted on making this trash as high quality as it is.I could go on for hours about every issue I have with Citrus, but I don't really have the energy for that, and I don't really think many people would be willing to read that.Overall, Citrus is a show that depicts sexual assault and the queer experience is a wholly wrong way, that is incredibly harmful to those who it supposedly represents. 3/10 don’t know how to start with their relationship.

I am constantly looking for good shoujo ai/yuri anime and when I noticed Citrus seemed to be a bit more popular than other shoujo ai I mistakenly thought ""ah then it can\'t be that bad."" But I was wrong.Despite what I have heard some saying, the sexual assault in this anime did not add any deeper meaning or lessons. It just happened and there seemed to be no consequences. Not only that but the...relationship between the two characters is not in anyway cute. It is (again at a lack of a better word) very toxic, and I am fine with media portraying a toxic relationship to show how bad they can be and how they can be hard for everyone involved and spread a positive message with the story. But Citrus did not spread any message at all, it just (IN MY OPINION) casually threw in some sexual assault, in what was the main relationship that you supposed to root for, and then just made the relationship toxic and hard to watch. Anyone who would want to be in this sort of relationship or think anything they did would be okay or cute to do, should get themselves mentally checked. relationship between the two characters is not in anyway cute.

The unconsensual groping and kissing scenes happen at least 5 times an episode. The characters aren\'t really well designed either and there\'s to many love triangles to keep up with. It\'s not ""deep"" like some may say, it\'s just a cash grab on some anime girls kissing. There\'s also some weird underage sexual implications.Good: Art is okay (main character has different clothes and her design is actually pretty cute), at least is some form of wlw.Bad: Rapey. Unnecessary plot points (*COUGH* they didn\'t need to be siblings *COUGH*)Overall:...I don\'t recommend watching. I almost stopped after the first 2 episodes but it somehow kept me interested.

This anime shatters the notion of homosexuality being something bad , inappropriate and abnormal and can make even a person like me acknowledge It as something extraordinary and astonishing. It has exactly ZERO perversion in It. I\'m a person who likes pure things and this show sums it all up. It\'s not your typical yuri relationship or...any of that , It goes far beyond that limitation and shows you the simple , yet sophisticated monologues of the characters who are really likeable and different than the ones in your everyday animated shows.It deserves much more attention and appreciation than It gets .P.S. -  It is a mistake to watch reviews so that you can ""presumably"" know If you\'d like a show or not. any of that , It goes far beyond that limitation and shows you the simple , yet sophisticated monologues of the characters who are really likeable and different than the ones in your everyday animated shows.It deserves much more attention and appreciation than It gets .P.S. -  It is a mistake to watch reviews so that you can ""presumably"" know If you\'d like a show or not.', 'It kinda sucks to see so much negativity towards this show because of some of the non-consensual stuff at the start. I\'m genuinely curious what its score would be without the hate scores.My personal opinion is that the show doesn\'t feed on non-consensual power fantasies, it tries to establish Mei as a damaged character. It also does a good job of establishing that Yuzu is a strong lead and fights off Mei.That being said, the show is short and develops its core plot in a bit of an awkward manner. Instead of focusing on the nice girl (Yuzu) learning more about the tsundere\'s (Mei) dark...past, which is the angle you would certainly expect after the first few episodes, it basically rehashes the same ""girl that gets in the way of their love"" thing twice.This is compounded by the way the romance unfolds. There appears to be a bit of a split, some people think Mei is an unlikable character, I happen to be of the opinion that Yuzu is just not very understanding of all that Mei has been through. Regardless, anyone can agree that it ends up boiling down to a lot of stubbornness and the general thought of ""man, relationships don\'t actually work like this in the real world"".That again, its a yuri anime drama, it doesn\'t need to make a lot of sense, it just sucks that if you carve out the 3 episodes at the start of any anime to establish the plot, and then the 3 at the end to build up to the end of the final conflict of any show, you only have 6 episodes to develop characters. That just isn\'t a lot of time, this really should have been 24 episodes, and it makes a lot of sense that the plot developed in a rushed way in light of the 12 episode run.Hopefully the hate doesn\'t land home, the show appears to have been super popular, so let\'s get a 24 episode S2! I\'d normally only give a show like this a 7, but I\'m giving it an 8 to account for the undeserved hate scores. past, which is the angle you would certainly expect after the first few episodes, it basically rehashes the same ""girl that gets in the way of their love"" thing twice.This is compounded by the way the romance unfolds.

Sure sometimes we'd get scenes that are overall better then in the manga. But i don't know what it is about the manga but i liked it ever so more.There were scenes where i was cringing while reading the manga such as when the chairman of the school first found out about Yuzu. I probably cringed and laughed a ton more in the show then the manga.My least favorite plot line that i remember from the manga...is the story arc when the loli comes in. She was bad in the manga and she's bad in the show. But i'd say that it's not as bad as in the Manga. I do know she becomes a pretty likable character later on in the Manga though.I do love that i feel they were able to do Mei and Yuzu right. I feel they could've easily messed both of them up. Yuzu is a really funny character and is funny how easily she get's embarrassed an Mei is really adorable when she get's embarrassed.Art is also kind of weird. It kind of looks cheap and low effort but it also kind of looks awesome and high quality.Overall i found the show to be fun and is just about on par with the Manga imo. is the story arc when the loli comes in.

One of the things I loved about Citrus is the story. I really love the original manga where it was adapted from by Saburo Uta. With that, I can say that this adaptation was not well presented it exchanged the titillation for over sexuality and this is prevalent with the opening theme and the ""Key Scenes"" of the story. It should be more provocative rather than blatant.Art is Very Good (8). Setting aside the story, the art is well done, and it is really nice to see the characters of the story realized. However, I...need to point out one thing: Momokino\'s Eyebrow should not be edited to become more pleasing. She has a thick eyebrow in the manga and it was created that way for a reason. This causes her character to lose a lot of personality in the story. These changes with the characters hurt the story rather than enhance it.Sound is Good (7). ""Azalea (アザレア)"" by nano.RIPE is a great song but I do not feel it was suited well for a story such as Citrus. It could have been better if they have chosen a song with a softer and a bit darker melody. I understand that the theme music wants to show a rebellious image since it is yuri but it was a step in the wrong direction. The soundtrack in general is good but it still misses on key scenes which is crucial for the story.Characters are Very Good (8). I really wanted to give this a 9 since I adore the manga a lot but I have to judge it based on the anime that is why I am taking a point away. Yuzu and Mei\'s characters are great as they carry the story but how they are interpreted in the story is just missing something: a heart. During the finale of the episode, there were scenes that are satisfying to see but like eating something citrus it has a bitter aftertaste. The same goes with supporting the characters.Generally, I came to winter with a lot of expectations with Citrus, but it disappointed me in a lot of its aspects.

In bad taste, overall.Next, the commonly complained plot point over the first two episodes showing quite violent sexual assault. First off, to those who say this is just a plot point or something they bond over, no. You can fuck off.

It honestly feels like a dude had a fantasy about all of these girls hooking up and decided to make it into a show. I'm too deep in at this point to back out, I might...as well watch the final episode.

The story consists of awkward pseudo-incest and non-consensual acts perpetrated by Mei onto Yuzu.

Yes there are a lot of problems in the world with sexual assault and rape, but I don't think this show is like that. There are a lot of things this show could have done better. But all in all it was a beautiful romance that I enjoyed watching.

Absolutely terrible.The anime is a romance anime apparently but my word the relationship building is embarrassingly poor, these characters have no actual reason to like each other and the attraction was started by what can only be called sexual assault...just awful, a heartless relationship with zero proper development except some weak attempts at emotional scenes which all fall flat because of the hollow nature of the relationship.The characters are terrible, the side characters especially are so poorly written and poorly related to the plot, they have basically no purpose. The main characters are just annoyingly stupid and poor at communication...in a very repetitive way, it is so dull.The animation is also not very good with several poorly done scenes and unnatural looking movements.There isn't enough comedy imo, good anime romance shows have lots of funny moments and hilarious side characters, just look at something like Horimiya or Domestic Girlfriend.It is a 1 out of 10, which may seem harsh but from episode 1 to episode 12 this show bored me to a new level and is quite frankly an embarrassing anime. in a very repetitive way, it is so dull.The animation is also not very good with several poorly done scenes and unnatural looking movements.There isn't enough comedy imo, good anime romance shows have lots of funny moments and hilarious side characters, just look at something like Horimiya or Domestic Girlfriend.It is a 1 out of 10, which may seem harsh but from episode 1 to episode 12 this show bored me to a new level and is quite frankly an embarrassing anime."", ""i'm not a big fan of yuri but since this is only ecchi and i was told there is good deal of jealousy involved i thought lets try something new for once so i checked this shit outif i say the plot is a Contrived mess mixed with asspulls i have not exaggeratedthe dialogues are horrible and emptier than the writer's skullthere are random scenes that don't contribute to the story at all for example the drama about the fucking grandpa didn't matter it was just a waste of timethe characters are so god damn empty, what is mei like? silent girl, that's it, introducing...her father didn't add any layer or depth to her character whatsoever, what is yuzu like? she is gay and that's that, and don't let me start on other characters beside yuzu and mei, her mom, her friends,... they had ZERO depth, not even a single decent dialogueevery girl in this anime is gay or bisexual like wtfthe plot is basically: Yuzu is gay so is Mei, they meet, mei kisses yuzu, yuzu shits herself, yuzu wants to confess but chickens out, Random Person Number 1 enters the scene and kisses mei right in front of yuzu, yuzu shits herself, Random Person Number 2 enters the scene and kisses yuzu right in front of mei, mei pretends to not give a fuck, Random Person Number 3 with her sister enters the scene and wants a threesome while blackmailing mei while licking her ears, both yuzu and mei kick her out, mei and yuzu kiss each other, yuzu shits herself, THE END (roll credits)it's unbelievable the most liked review for this anime is a recommended type and gives this series 8/10 while admitting all these flaws!!! we really are living in post-Truth era aren't we?literally everyone watched this anime for the lesbian action, but to my surprise there wasn't anything wild here, only simple kissesbtw the fact that mei totally losing her control while getting her ears touched right in front of her enemy was full retard modewatch it ,don't watch it , IDGAF her father didn't add any layer or depth to her character whatsoever, what is yuzu like? she is gay and that's that, and don't let me start on other characters beside yuzu and mei, her mom, her friends,... they had ZERO depth, not even a single decent dialogueevery girl in this anime is gay or bisexual like wtfthe plot is basically: Yuzu is gay so is Mei, they meet, mei kisses yuzu, yuzu shits herself, yuzu wants to confess but chickens out, Random Person Number 1 enters the scene and kisses mei right in front of yuzu, yuzu shits herself, Random Person Number 2 enters the scene and kisses yuzu right in front of mei, mei pretends to not give a fuck, Random Person Number 3 with her sister enters the scene and wants a threesome while blackmailing mei while licking her ears, both yuzu and mei kick her out, mei and yuzu kiss each other, yuzu shits herself, THE END (roll credits)it's unbelievable the most liked review for this anime is a recommended type and gives this series 8/10 while admitting all these flaws!!! we really are living in post-Truth era aren't we?literally everyone watched this anime for the lesbian action, but to my surprise there wasn't anything wild here, only simple kissesbtw the fact that mei totally losing her control while getting her ears touched right in front of her enemy was full retard modewatch it ,don't watch it , IDGAF"", 'Citrus was my ex-girlfriend\'s favorite anime and my god, does that explain a whole lot.Anyways I knew this anime was about some weird step-sister incest shit, but I still watched it because I just felt like watching something shitty. I was prepared for the incest shit, not for how rapey the show is. To be honest, this show could\'ve been at least decent without all the gross shit. God, I just want healthy lesbians relationships in anime, not gross, yuri shit, and THIS.First of all, Yuzu and Mei are sisters? What the fuck? Step-sisters but still sisters. ""Oh well it\'s not biological so it\'s fine.""...Legally? Technically in some states, yes. Morally? It\'s still gross in most cases. If they were raised as siblings, or see each other as siblings, then it\'s gross, because they still have a sibling relationship. Step-siblings are still siblings. I have step-siblings and since I saw them as my siblings the idea of dating one of them makes me wanna die. Yuzu and Mei weren\'t raised together, but they call each other their sister and stuff. And the show is all ""Oh! Look at these sisters making out. Isn\'t that so hot?"" It\'s like they wanted to write some gross incest crap but decided to use the ""Oh, well technically they\'re step-siblings!"" as an excuse.The incest isn\'t the only problem I have with this show. It\'s also super rapey. The characters sexually assault each other many times throughout the show and it\'s portrayed as sexy and romantic, and even brushed off as a joke. It seems that every time Mei kisses or touches Yuzu without consent (or vice versa) they get even closer. Ew. Sexual assault and abuse aren\'t romantic. Mei and Yuzu are such an unhealthy relationship. This is some Stockholm syndrome shit. Also didn\'t Yuzu, who is 16, go on a date with Matsuri, who is 13? Um? Also kinda gross.They could\'ve created a story similar to this without all the incest, sexual assault, etc. They were trying to go the whole \'forbidden love\' route when the step-sibling aspect wasn\'t needed. The fact that they\'re both girls could\'ve been forbidden love enough. Homophobia still exists. Make them not step-sisters, make the forbidden love aspect the fact that they\'re gay. And get rid of the weird rape shit. Boom. Fixed it, now it isn\'t gross. Or hell, if you wanted them to remain sisters, get rid of the romance and focus of their sisterly bonds or some shit. Just not this. We\'re really sick and tired of all the lesbian romances in anime being some weird, creepy shit. Legally? Technically in some states, yes. Morally? It\'s still gross in most cases.

Would it kill the authors to write a normal healthy romance between women instead of writing this \'I fell in love with a person only to find out that they\'re my step sibling\' trope??? This is basically Domestic Girlfriend, but worse. At least no one actually takes Domestic Girlfriend seriously, not even the anime itself. Sometimes it was so ridiculous and WRONG that it was just funny. Citrus on the other hand is almost unbearable to watch because it takes itself too seriously even though the premise is fking ridiculous and just BAD.If...you wanted to make a steamy step sisters hent@i you should have just done that. Why pose as something you\'re not? Why pretend to be this mature, emotional and vanilla love drama?? It doesn\'t help that the Mei girl is so ridiculously unlikable. Sometimes she seems to show character development only to go back to being a b\'tch the next moment. I get being introverted and having issues but like... man do you really have to be so cold and rude to others when they\'re being so nice to you??? Even more than the step-sisters love story, i hated the fact that the Blondie literally has no self respect. Mei treats her like sh*t and she just... accepts it??? Worse yet she keeps coming back to her.Those were my personal grudges, but this anime is objectively just... not good. Like at all. So many horrible characters simply never face any consequences for their actions, and they seem to suddenly turn into good people in the span of like 1 episode. Examples are the grandpa, the vice president who has an unhealthy obsession with mei, pink haired psycho who\'s obsessed with yuzu and mei\'s dad. The worst was pink haired girl. She was vile. Not only is she crazy and obsessive, she literally commits a crime by blackmailing mei and even setting her up for m0lestation. And you\'re telling me she doesn\'t face ANY consequences for these actions, and she even turns \'nice\' all of a sudden for like no fkin reason?? This anime is beyond stupid. Good characters are good for no other reason than because they\'re supposed to represent the \'I\'m such a nice person because I\'m an airhead... haha... even though everyone treats me like trash"" trope. The mom was pretty much a generic a$$ anime mom with no personality whatsoever. I don\'t fking get why she even married a man who literally is NEVER home. Like how do you love a person like that??? WHY do you like a person like that??? He\'s never there for his family. He\'s selfish. He cares only about himself. He never even raised his own daughter and left her to a life of misery. And instead of ridiculing him for his actions the anime glorifies him as this amazing model dad figure who was \'nice all along\'. Instead of making us not like him by pointing out the obvious flaws in his character, he is shown as this goody two-shoes person the moment he\'s actually introduced in the anime. I hated how Yuzu even defended this man.And this is not where the problematic aspects of this anime end, the romance is dogsh*t, it has no flavour and trust me at some point people get bored of the constant back and forth. And WHY do they have to romantize this relationship??? Not only is it pseudo incest but also just... not healthy. Mei constantly acts as if yuzu is the one dying to do stuff to her and she\'s doing a \'favour\' by playing into it. Even though internally she wants it just as much, but God forbid if she voices it. Also why does the anime never address the utterly wrong tradition of engaging young teenage girls to grown a$$ men???? Why was the whole plot point of that male teacher grooming mei brushed off so easily??? Jesus we could be here all day pointing out the many flaws this anime has. But I\'m gonna stop now cuz I can\'t bare to waste a second more thinking of this atrocity. I hope they start making more nice and healthy lesbian anime like Bloom Into You in the future and stop with these weird shows. you wanted to make a steamy step sisters hent@i you should have just done that.

There she enrolled to a all girl high school. While there, she met with the student Council president, Mei.

There is a lot of details put in through this anime. For instance, the way Yuzu run sounds different when Himeko run. There is some depths in it.Color and Animation - 7/10Although I have no background in this area, but i think this anime is a decent anime with a decent color palette. A soft, soothing color pallette. It's might not for everyone since it's more i  the calm side and more toward that choppy storybook looks like than a fluid animated drawing.Enjoyment - 9/10The pacing on this anime is honestly one of the biggest flaw for people who want a faster pacing but the characters development here is quite a good one. It has the premise to build their loves exquisitely. It's very smooth and it's not feel like it got dragged by the timeline.Overall it's a solid one for people who wants a slow pace yuri show.

And during the ""intimate"" between Yuzu and Mei, Mei is weirdly possessive...and forceful of Yuzu, which comes off as very weird, especially when you realise that the characters are still in high school, them both being 16, which makes the sexual nature of their relationship illegal in Japan apart from one prefecture.The bathing scene alone is what made me quit the anime, as it was incredibly gross for people their age, of their relationship, depicting wlw relationships this way; and with the lack of consent from Yuzu which was the part that really through me off*this depiction of wlw relationships, or any lgbt relationship is extremely harmful to the communities as they depict the relationships as taboo and a dirty little secret isn\'t as helpful as the people fetishizing them think it is. and forceful of Yuzu, which comes off as very weird, especially when you realise that the characters are still in high school, them both being 16, which makes the sexual nature of their relationship illegal in Japan apart from one prefecture.The bathing scene alone is what made me quit the anime, as it was incredibly gross for people their age, of their relationship, depicting wlw relationships this way; and with the lack of consent from Yuzu which was the part that really through me off*this depiction of wlw relationships, or any lgbt relationship is extremely harmful to the communities as they depict the relationships as taboo and a dirty little secret isn\'t as helpful as the people fetishizing them think it is.', 'this is pretty fucked up.I had never been happier to have finished an anime.

I have been waiting for a Yuri anime for a while and you can tell I\'m a fan of these if you look at the rating I gave Sakura Trick, which was also a 10.Now, I know that, if I were to rate this one (and Sakura Trick as well, for that matter), objectively, it would quite certainly not be a 10. I tried to be more objective when rating the story, art, sound and character design, though.In itself,...the story was a bit interesting. It isn\'t exactly your usual slice of life anime, where nothing too fascinating happens and it just exhibits regular life for a specific group of people. Rather, it\'s more on the romantic drama side.I had to rate the art a bit lower. It\'s definitely not one of those series that you\'ll just look at the art and it\'ll turn you off to the point where you just want to drop it, but they surely could have done a better job with it. An instance where I found the art lacking was when crowded areas were being presented. You could see the main characters moving around in the middle of lots of people, while all these people were frozen in place and nobody was moving. Obviously, they were part of the background, but it just felt completely unnatural.The sound was, in my opinion, pretty good. I don\'t really have much to say about it. As far as the soundtracks are concerned, I enjoyed the opening one to the point where I never actually skipped it, but that\'s just personal taste.The character design was also quite diverse. You have Yuzu, the main character of the show, who is generally an optimistic person and tries to always look at the bright side of things. She\'s one of those people that are usually excessively excited, but not to the point where it gets irritating and obnoxious (I\'m looking at you, Death March). To counter her personality, you get Mei, a more serious-minded and well-reserved person. She usually hides her feelings and isn\'t very open about them. There\'s also side-characters, like Harumin (Yuzu\'s friend) and the vice president, who either help the story progress or are just there for support.I gave this one an overall rating of 10 because, taking into account the amount of enjoyment I got from it personally, I just couldn\'t let myself give it anything lower than that. As I did mention, though, this is a biased score. The fact that there hasn\'t been many anime for a while now (or even generally), whose main focus is the romantic relationship between women, led me to rate it this high. A lot of series that I have watched do hint at such relationships, but they are never open about it, nor is that their basic focus.I would definitelly recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of the Yuri genre. I believe this one is similar to Sakura Trick, but actually has a plot this time instead of just being random scenes of girls making out.I would assume that, from a perspective of somebody who isn\'t big on this genre, this wouldn\'t be very interesting to watch. Yet, if you are into the romance genre and don\'t mind it being between girls, this can still be something that you\'d possibly like watching. If this series were to be briefly and very vaugely described, it would be something in the lines of ""an extrovert trying to get an introvert to open up to them"".I guess this is obvious, but do not attempt to watch this if you\'re not at least okay with romance between two girls. I\'m pointing this out because there were many people giving this show very low ratings due to the fact that it included such a thing. It should be understandable that it will, when you see the ""Yuri"" tag. There\'s no point in you watching it, unless you are okay with what that tag entails.To the people planning to watch this, have fun. It definitelly was one of the best series for me personally. In fact, I was looking forward to Sunday morning every time, because I\'d get to sit and watch a new episode of this. the story was a bit interesting.

You could see the main characters moving around in the middle of lots of people, while all these people were frozen in place and nobody was moving. Obviously, they were part of the background, but it just felt completely unnatural.The sound was, in my opinion, pretty good. I don\'t really have much to say about it. As far as the soundtracks are concerned, I enjoyed the opening one to the point where I never actually skipped it, but that\'s just personal taste.The character design was also quite diverse. You have Yuzu, the main character of the show, who is generally an optimistic person and tries to always look at the bright side of things. She\'s one of those people that are usually excessively excited, but not to the point where it gets irritating and obnoxious (I\'m looking at you, Death March). To counter her personality, you get Mei, a more serious-minded and well-reserved person. She usually hides her feelings and isn\'t very open about them. There\'s also side-characters, like Harumin (Yuzu\'s friend) and the vice president, who either help the story progress or are just there for support.I gave this one an overall rating of 10 because, taking into account the amount of enjoyment I got from it personally, I just couldn\'t let myself give it anything lower than that. As I did mention, though, this is a biased score. The fact that there hasn\'t been many anime for a while now (or even generally), whose main focus is the romantic relationship between women, led me to rate it this high. A lot of series that I have watched do hint at such relationships, but they are never open about it, nor is that their basic focus.I would definitelly recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of the Yuri genre. I believe this one is similar to Sakura Trick, but actually has a plot this time instead of just being random scenes of girls making out.I would assume that, from a perspective of somebody who isn\'t big on this genre, this wouldn\'t be very interesting to watch. Yet, if you are into the romance genre and don\'t mind it being between girls, this can still be something that you\'d possibly like watching. If this series were to be briefly and very vaugely described, it would be something in the lines of ""an extrovert trying to get an introvert to open up to them"".I guess this is obvious, but do not attempt to watch this if you\'re not at least okay with romance between two girls. I\'m pointing this out because there were many people giving this show very low ratings due to the fact that it included such a thing. It should be understandable that it will, when you see the ""Yuri"" tag. There\'s no point in you watching it, unless you are okay with what that tag entails.To the people planning to watch this, have fun. It definitelly was one of the best series for me personally. In fact, I was looking forward to Sunday morning every time, because I\'d get to sit and watch a new episode of this.', ""I won't go into political statements like other reviewers as it does not fit this anime whatsoever and frankly, it's unneeded.Citrus in a nutshell is a manga adaptation badly done, rushed and at times bland.It doesn't do anything too badly but doesn't do it right either. At the end of the show Mei is still a enigma, Yuzu doesn't go into depth as a character past the first impressions and everyone else seems to be there just for the ride. No doubt this is the result of a rushed adaptation.I can't recall a single song or OST that striked me as grandiose and...the animation/art is what you would expect in every single other show.This is the definition of an average anime that just so happens to be yuri, nothing more, nothing less. the animation/art is what you would expect in every single other show.This is the definition of an average anime that just so happens to be yuri, nothing more, nothing less."", 'Alright where do I start. I originally wanted to watch this because everyone said the manga was terrific. They were wrong. Not only was the plot garbage, but also it had absolutely NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. From episode one, Mei had the weirdest personality. She was condescending and cold for NO REASON to Yuzu. She kissed her without consent to get her to ""shut up"". I\'m sorry what? Yes you heard me right. She kissed her to get her to stop talking. The author probably has never been in a relationship and fantasizes about no consent relationships all day. Yuzu, unlike Mei, was a bubbly happy...retard who fell in LOVE with Mei the moment she was kissed without consent. Wth. She never doubted the creepiness of Mei\'s intrusive nature. Yuzu never really developed as a character from ep 1 to ep 12. The worst two characters by far are Matsuri and the curly haired failure that follows Mei everywhere. Matsuri was clearly raised by wolves. She tries to make moves on Yuzu and constantly calls her ""onee-chan"" in the most irritating and nauseating voice ever heard in the history of anime. She is about 14 years old and sexts old men to make money. Darling where are your parents? Author what are you trying to teach to young girls watching this anime? The anime literally could have done without her. Period. Now for the curly haired failure that followed Mei around like a puppy, she was just absurd and downright weird. Why is she so obsessed with Mei? Mei is an empty shell without a personality. Another thing that bothered me was the addition of Nina and her sister Sara in the last couple episodes. The author had to shove them in there because the story started to get repetitive and boring. The author also had to shove Matsuri in the anime because things started to get repetitive and boring. See the trend? Sara and Nina were both cookie cutter lame 3-year old acting girls who did not help the plot one bit. It was quite frankly nauseating watching them act like toddlers. This is what I hate about anime. They feel the need to shove toddler looking and acting girls into rom com and slice of life animes and claim that they are in high school. All in all, I thought this anime was a complete flop. A failure. A work of trash. A disgrace. The author could have written the story better and actually developed the characters ffs. But nooooo she had to lose all her brain cells before she wrote Citrus. Should have just made it a hentai. Nuff said. retard who fell in LOVE with Mei the moment she was kissed without consent. Wth.

Nuff said.', 'This show was quite deceptive, from its title I thought it was going to be about oranges or vitamin C, but oh boy was I wrong. Though with all seriousness, this show delves right into the sole reason of why you are actually watching it to begin with, which is LESBIAN LOVE! Oh Yea! The show is in no way apologetic about it and presents the viewer with what he or she wants right off the bat, with an opening that sets the tone for the rest of the show. Showing our two hot, non-blood related, incestuous love birds hitting it off with some tongue...action a couple of times throughout that minute and a half opening just to make sure you don’t skip it (I sure as hell didn’t, these scenes were the most enjoyable part of the show!).Hello and welcome, I am a unique MAL user here to bring you a unique and short review, because you don’t have the time to read and I don’t have to time to write (it’s mostly because of the latter though)!If you don’t feel like reading here is my TL;DR: You’ll get more satisfaction from watching a Yuri hentai than this.Story:The story is about this girl called Yuzu who moves to a new area and transfers to a new school because her mom had remarried a deadbeat dad who never seems to be around, erm sorry what I meant to say was a father who loves helping other children abroad, and in the process got herself a stepsister called Mei, whom she falls in love with right away because she sexually assaults her (I wish this would happen in real life, this way I would have had a harem by now...). Ever heard of love at first sight? Yea, here it’s love after a first kiss.I am going to be honest when saying that I went into the show not really expected much out of it, because all I really wanted was to watch some girls hit it off, but somehow despite this it managed to disappoint. Yuzu, who never seemed interested in girls, falls in love with Mei for no apparent reason asides from her forcefully imposing a kiss out of the blue. What followed after that was by no means romantic, it was molestation or perhaps even rape; for the next few episodes all we ever saw was forceful sexual harassment to the point where I felt that each of them was developing Stockholm’s syndrome. Things kept going this way even after a love triangle was established, with the new girl being as kinky, if not more, as they are. I mean yes sure seeing girls forcing themselves on each other was fun the first few times, but the joy of it wore off quicker than I thought it would. Though to be honest all this frustration was my fault, I thought that some Yuri would be enough for me to be satisfied with a show that I didn’t expect much out of anyways, but I was wrong. The worst part is that it had potential to touch upon the subject of incest in a serious way, since we saw some feelings of regret, hesitance, and doubt among both our main characters at the start. Both questioned the morality of their actions and their relationship for some time, which would have been interesting had it been well explored. I believe that the show should have focused on the stresses that they could have felt while hiding their love affair and could have explored their long-term goals and expectations of this romance knowing that they may not be able to take it to another level or may have to indefinitely keep it a secret. Another issue that the show, unfortunately, fails to capitalize upon the idea that a person’s environment can shape a person’s sexual orientation. I used to be in a school were the girls and boys where segregated, so I got to witness and experience some of the things that the show tried to portray, such as girls holding hands and acting like lovers, even though they were not supposedly gay.Instead of trying to focus on social issues such as those mentioned above, the show chooses a path of redundancy where events that we had previously seen and experienced kept being reiterated. For the first time in a long while I felt like my brain was on cruise control; something which I rarely experience when watching a show, which pretty much means that what is going on in my head is far more entertaining that what was playing on the screen.Characters:Somehow the show’s plot stands out more than its characters. From what I had experienced, this show simply consists of a group of sexually frustrated female high schoolers who all seem to want to find true love. Now this is not a bad thing on its own of course, but the way these characters were presented and the way they approach their supposed love interests are rather identical and nonsensical. The one character that stands out happens to be Matsuri, and not because she happens to be interesting, but because she has the squeakiest voice I have ever heard! I had to take a step back whenever I heard her speak, her voice was incredibly weird to listen to.Animation:The animations of the show do the trick, meaning that they are not particularly good or bad. However, the show did have some pretty weird and sometimes even awful CGI, especially when the cars were displayed. Though overall they were fine.Music:Similar to the animations, the music does the trick. The opening and ending of the show were fine and mildly entertaining, though will did not leave a lasting mark. The same thing applies to the OST of the show which, in general, never really stood out or distracted me, which means it was just fine, not bad or good enough to make my eyes pop wide-open O_O.Overall:I do not recommend you watch this because, even though I am no expert when it comes to romance, I am sure there are far more satisfying shows than this. action a couple of times throughout that minute and a half opening just to make sure you don’t skip it (I sure as hell didn’t, these scenes were the most enjoyable part of the show!).Hello and welcome, I am a unique MAL user here to bring you a unique and short review, because you don’t have the time to read and I don’t have to time to write (it’s mostly because of the latter though)!If you don’t feel like reading here is my TL;DR: You’ll get more satisfaction from watching a Yuri hentai than this.Story:The story is about this girl called Yuzu who moves to a new area and transfers to a new school because her mom had remarried a deadbeat dad who never seems to be around, erm sorry what I meant to say was a father who loves helping other children abroad, and in the process got herself a stepsister called Mei, whom she falls in love with right away because she sexually assaults her (I wish this would happen in real life, this way I would have had a harem by now...).

Your Partner Max', ""TLDR; This is an anime that I love to hate. The story is terrible, characters are shallow and fickle, and the pacing is atrocious. But I'm still going to finish it. Why? I have no idea, but it just a fun little anime.There's no denying that this anime is bad. The anime is a faithful representation to the manga, which was seemingly popular. But bad. Really bad.To me, it seems that the writers had tonnes of ideas for things they could do with this story, but didn't think too much about how to flesh out the characters or how to pace the story. So...in their rush to get to the parts they wanted to, character development and pacing went out the window.Spoilers ahead---------------------In the first two episodes, the main character (Yuzu) does a complete 180 degree turn in her stance on her new step-sister, Mei, who forced her tongue into her mouth for shits and giggles about 5 secconds after meeting her. Somehow, this leads Yuzu to fall helplessly in love with Mei, for reasons unknown.For the next 6 episodes, Yuzu is forced to deal with her feelings. Seems a bit much, a bit fast. But then Yuzu jumps through a stupid amount of hoops, constantly having her emotions toyed with by Mei, as she attempts to get closer to Mei so they can make out without Mei raping her for once. A love triangle is introduced, but literally only lasts about an episode, making it the most useless arc in anime history. Mei's father is introduced, then the problem is resolved within 2 minutes. ANOTHER useless arc.Yuzu then realises Mei needs a sister and not a lover. This is stupid.Mei was the person who first made their relationship sexual, and never tried to be a sister in the first episode. Why did she do that? No idea. And I don't think we will ever know. Now another love triangle has been introduced, and I don't think it will go anywhere either.The art style and character voices are both decent, and do as good a job possible with the two dimensional characters. Opening is decent, but forgettable.Look. This anime is bad. But you should consider watching it. Its something of a guilty pleasure. Think of it like one of those brainless soaps on the TV. They are stupid and drama filled, but you want to keep watching. in their rush to get to the parts they wanted to, character development and pacing went out the window.Spoilers ahead---------------------In the first two episodes, the main character (Yuzu) does a complete 180 degree turn in her stance on her new step-sister, Mei, who forced her tongue into her mouth for shits and giggles about 5 secconds after meeting her.

It wasn't entertaining the first time and it certainly isn't entertaining now.Keep making wlw romance, just stop it with all the rape please"", ""Although the finale presented some excitable moments, it's still felt anti-climactic for the best part of the episode.Obviously, romance themed anime in general tread a very bumpy road, it's Yuri equivalent fared no better and largely remained with those cringy awkward scenes where you question the likelihood of it actually happening in reality.Not the greatest anime, and I'd be lying if I said there was no part of me here for the exaggerated Yuri tropes.However, I do see it slated for a second season.Recently there's been a movie release dates Love, Simon which explores homsexuality; I haven't watched it but what I've heard and from...the clips I've seen is that of the closet mentality typical of people of that orientation and how to come to terms with it. This anime does not cover ihomosexuality from this perspective, which let me down; it's built a setting where towards those people around you it is a taboo, but when leaving that crowd it is a social norm i.e. the kisses that took place in public locations.Now, this isn't homophobia, but at this moment of time even though strides have been made in equality for different orientations it has not compleely integrated with society yet; which is a shame.Moving onto Japan, I've read up on Japan time and time again for various things (because of my interest in japan); historically, lords were allowed young boys (before maturity) as servants with which they could have intercourse with -however further research is pending, so don't take my word for it- what im getting at is this suggests sexual tolerance, but recent reports have suggested that there is a number of homosexuals in Japan who get into heterosexual relationships out of fear/humiliation/embarrassment.In any case, such symptoms are naturally more severe in younger individuals, particularly because of expectations from parents, guardians, elders etc. So yeah, whilst it may be a harmless anime, it had the potential of helping homosexuals adjust and empower them by going through the same circumstances -of which it failed to do.Apart from this rant, this anime in general had an average story but whatever me the most were that pedestrian themes of the anime had somehow elevated e.g. the glittery eyes, the flowing hair, the sadist, the dangerous rival, the silver haired wildcard...It had everything, and everything was enhanced by the artwork.From time to time. It was gripping. The suspense had my heart skip a beat. I made memes FFS. MEMES. And it was because I hated on the rival.Then there was the calm... The quiet... The intimacy between the two protagonists (yuzuha and Mei it seems).I'm a guy, not gonna lie, fingers crossed for some scenes to cross the threshold. Honestly, some scenes were on thin ice that I am not at fault. Some scenes were suggestive.To summarise, the romance story was generic... Who cares, anime's a tendency to do that; but if you like borderline suggestive Yuri, I don't see why not. the clips I've seen is that of the closet mentality typical of people of that orientation and how to come to terms with it. This anime does not cover ihomosexuality from this perspective, which let me down; it's built a setting where towards those people around you it is a taboo, but when leaving that crowd it is a social norm i.e. the kisses that took place in public locations.Now, this isn't homophobia, but at this moment of time even though strides have been made in equality for different orientations it has not compleely integrated with society yet; which is a shame.Moving onto Japan, I've read up on Japan time and time again for various things (because of my interest in japan); historically, lords were allowed young boys (before maturity) as servants with which they could have intercourse with -however further research is pending, so don't take my word for it- what im getting at is this suggests sexual tolerance, but recent reports have suggested that there is a number of homosexuals in Japan who get into heterosexual relationships out of fear/humiliation/embarrassment.In any case, such symptoms are naturally more severe in younger individuals, particularly because of expectations from parents, guardians, elders etc. So yeah, whilst it may be a harmless anime, it had the potential of helping homosexuals adjust and empower them by going through the same circumstances -of which it failed to do.Apart from this rant, this anime in general had an average story but whatever me the most were that pedestrian themes of the anime had somehow elevated e.g. the glittery eyes, the flowing hair, the sadist, the dangerous rival, the silver haired wildcard...It had everything, and everything was enhanced by the artwork.From time to time. It was gripping. The suspense had my heart skip a beat. I made memes FFS. MEMES. And it was because I hated on the rival.Then there was the calm... The quiet... The intimacy between the two protagonists (yuzuha and Mei it seems).I'm a guy, not gonna lie, fingers crossed for some scenes to cross the threshold. Honestly, some scenes were on thin ice that I am not at fault. Some scenes were suggestive.To summarise, the romance story was generic...

I don\'t watch these types of shows as it is, so take that for what it\'s worth.As a lesbian living in a straight man\'s body, I can definitely identify with some if the plots of this show.But...There\'s no originality here, take any porn plot that involves two step sisters, then make an anime about it. Everything was really predictable and honestly there were so many plot issues I couldn\'t find myself checking out to watch the show, I\'m not going to spoil anything, but let\'s just say it has to...do more with the characters family. I\'m not one of the people who really cares if the characters are lesbians/bi/gay/straight, but honestly it feels forced in this. If it was just a normal romance than fine, but I felt like every 5 seconds I heard the word ""sister"" or the phrase ""all girl"", yeah everyone gets it... it\'s a Yuri.... move on.The dialog was so terrible I ended up laughing through the parts that were suppose to be serious. Which I can say that was a perk. The intended humor parts were pretty funny too.Characters are bland, neither of the characters ever really develop outside of the stereotypes.Opening theme song is pretty good though... So yay?Overall if you like romance animes, might want to skip this, I don\'t feel like it\'ll offer anything that another one can\'t or at least ones I have seen. I wouldn\'t even really put it in that category because it\'s too gimmicky.I\'ll be your big sis and tell you not watch this unless you just tryna find a unsatisfying nut. do more with the characters family.

Consider reading this review only after you have finnished the anime/manga. It contains some spoilers, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE ENDING OF THE SHOW! Ill try to avoid as much as i can, and focus only on the development of the show, and how its handled. English isnt my native language, so im sorry in advance for any grammar errors. Also, i didnt read the manga, so the review is solely based on the anime.Taboo topics are hard to grasp and transfer into any form of a show. That's why there are not that many good yuri series. Throwing some kind of incest into the pot?...What could go wrong, right? Well.. alot. By creating an ambitious plot idea its easy to slip and fall dramatically, which sadly is the case with Citrus. There are alot of reviews of people who actually praise it for, apparently, good character design, intriguing plot, etc. I'll try to explain why i strongly disagree with any of that, especially within the Character, and Story score section of the review. It will be propably pretty lenghty, so bear with me.Art [5/10]The show immediately teases us with some really bright scenery and good looking, attractive characters. It's true, that art has some value here and there, but its very rare occurance the more you watch. The landscapes of the city that you're shown in the beginning are just forgotten after few episodes, because the show keeps you in the claustrophobic scenery for the most of the time. All you see is the same room, house, and school for around 6-8 episodes straight. That's a bad decision on the director's part, since the show has nothing to offer at the end. Why? Keep reading.As far as animation goes, it's pretty okay. Sometimes. When the shot's are close ups on the characters, they are looking gorgeous. But the further the camera is, the more awkward the animation and the art gets. Im sorry, but it gets so ridiculous sometimes with the facial expressions in the distance, that you're wondering if the character is sad, or needs to take a shit really bad. Colours are either badly composed, or too bright/sharp, very inconsistent. Nothing special most of the time, sometimes good, and VERY awkward, alot.Sound [3/10]There is nothing here to say about it for the most part. Music feels dull, and out of place sometimes, like it's from a Looney Tunes cartoon. Like, what? My ear didnt catch anything worth attention the whole story, except the main theme that plays when they kiss, etc. That's it.I liked a few voice actors, Yuzu's best friend had the best one in my opinion. The Yuzu and Mei voice actors were nothing special.Story [3/10]Alright.. here we go. Listen. You know when someone tries to do everything right too hard, and fails miserably in everything? It's really sad to see that. And im very sad that this happened to Citrus.We have a very good setup at first, the girl living with her mom, who found a new boyfriend who has a daughter, and she moves in to live with them. I leave their character design to the next section, but the plot looks kinda interesting, and it has some potential. Now here's the choice of the director. Do you want to make an anime about family drama? Or maybe about lesbian relationship drama? Maybe incest? Maybe a fucking soap opera with alot of fan service? Nah, lets just do it all at once. Look, im not saying that these cant exist together in a show, but you cant fit that many eggs in one basket and carry it without any difficulty ahead. I have a feeling that the director just threw some plots all together and mixed them without any reason. Lets talk about every option separately.Incest is hard to portrait, since its a taboo topic, that's not all that acceptable overall. I've heard it's a lighter topic in Japan, but im not sure if that's true, and im not gonna pretend i do know if it is. The anime Yosuga no Sora did handled it pretty well, not perfect but you know what was the conclusion at the end, whenever you accept it, or not. Sometimes you dont choose who you love, and with that said, there are alot of consequences, whenever you like it or not, if you decide to embrace your feelings. In the case of Citrus, all the incest plot was just so poor, and not neccesary. The struggles shown in the series felt fake, and weird, like it wasnt really a problem, but they tried to really make you believe it is.The second part, lesbian relationships. With romance there are few things to consider to make any decent story. Drama, and the feelings that people have for eachother, and the overall chemistry of the characters. If you want to throw some fan service there, go ahead, whatever. But the director in this case didnt decide what he wants to do with it. The drama was shallow, and obnoxious, alot of characters were purely plot devices (which i will come back to it later), and the story didnt mean anything at the end. Most of the kissing scenes were thrown without context or purpose, except one. They just fucking kissed, because. After i saw the third character was also a lesbian, i knew how its going to be till the end. Just alot of lesbians everywhere, because, and they want to kiss, and shit. The drama was just there to extend the show maybe, i dont know, really.The conclusion is, if you cant decide on something, its still better to pick only one, sacrifice and cut the idea abit and go with it. If you mix it all together without any thought its just a clusterfuck of everything that doesnt fit all together, and feels unfinnished, and not authentic.Character [4/10]This show has non existent chemistry between the main characters. I know they just met, and are forced to live together, and they develop some feelings along the way. But even at the end, you dont understand what is going on, what's the drive of their own decisions, and choices, especially in the case of Mei. The only likable character was Harumi, and i really wish she had any backstory to her character. Yuzu is obnoxious for the whole show, and Mei is just a stereotypical lifeless doll that doesnt speak much, has a cold personality, and does weird shit all day. At the end, you would expect a feeling that they're actually meant for each other, and feel the chemistry between them. Instead, they feel like strangers to each other, forever.About the backstory. Alot of characters dont have any backstory at all, or its so short, that you cant really tell who they are, or care about anyone. Examples are, Mei's father, grandfather, Matsuri and the twins at the end. Especially the twins. They appear at the end just for the sake of fueling the drama even more, so the main characters cant go together yet, because MORE USELESS DRAMA.Enjoyment [2/10]Overall [4/10]I've thrown enjoyment and overall conclusion together, because this review is fairly long, and there's no point of repeating what's already said.This show is dreadfuly boring, and tasteless. It's a jack-of-all-trades attempt, a pretty horrible one. This story could have some potential, but sadly, it was handled very poorly. The incest plot is unnecesary, and the mix of Yuri romance/Drama is the worst of its kind. Im giving it a 4, just because i really felt this show could be more. It had only a few good moments, and it makes me really sad.Dont waste your time on it, and i mean it. Thank you. What could go wrong, right? Well.. alot.

I\'m not particularly fond of it myself, I just find it a bit weird, I know that it floats some people\'s boat, but not mine. Because of this, the show had...this slightly weird feel to it. I probably would of liked the romantic angle of this show a lot more if I wasn\'t reminded every 5 minutes that they\'re sisters.One area where I think the show really did do well was in the visuals. the show looked really good and the animation was fluid and pleasing to the eye. it\'s definitely the best thing about Citrus.The sound was decent. I enjoyed the voice acting and there were a couple of stand out tracks from the soundtrack. However I wasn\'t particularly fond of either the opening or ending theme. I never usually skip opening themes but I found myself doing so on Citrus on more than one occasion.The characters in Citrus are a mixed bag. For example I really enjoyed Yuzu as a main character, she was fun and silly, but also had her share of emotional moments that I feel made her a well rounded character. She also had a great chemistry with her friend Harumin, who was always there to lighten the mood.Unfortunately, I can\'t really say the same for Yuzu\'s love interest, Mei. She seemed very one dimensional and often lacked any emotion. I know this is her character trait, but I didn\'t really feel any need to try and look deeper into her character that what was shown on the surface. I also don\'t particularly agree with her method of seduction but that\'s a whole different story.There were some genuinely good moments in the show. Times where the drama felt real and like it really mattered. The humour is good. It looks great and had a few likeable characters.However, there were a lot of moments that I felt just didn\'t really make sense or just were forgettable in general. The soundtrack was a mixed bag of good tracks and completely forgettable or overused tracks, and the whole show I feel was just tainted slightly by the slightly odd romantic incest angle.And really, that is Citrus in a nut shell. It has a few standout moments, but overall, it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.I give Citrus a 5/10. this slightly weird feel to it.

Take someone a little broken or empty, and it becomes hauntingly confusing and just a little too dark for anyone unfamiliar with the feeling. Citrus is an honest portrayal of this dark side to relationships. It's a tragedy, a crime even, to reduce its delicacy and sophistication to just a gratification story. The story is of two people growing as individuals and as a couple. The pace is slow and unsteady, and realistically so. Yuzu and Mei take their bittersweet time becoming closer, healing and understanding themselves and each other. The show deserves to be seen and understood beyond its...visual and shock factor. It's so much more than just two girls kissing because they feel like it; granted, they do kiss a lot.More than decent animation. Appropriate and truly exceptional background music. Striking opening and ending songs. Breathtaking settings. Immersive cinematography. The show makes use of elements that are notable on their own, but are directed and pieced together in a way that makes them infinitely more effective together than alone. What's most notable about Citrus is its direction. While the dialogue exchanges weren't the most memorable, they match the story and the characters' personalities so well it makes them relatable and impactful. The characters alone are interesting and emotive, but the dynamics created by these characters make the stellar storytelling. The coming together of its pictures and music in telling the story of its characters, is where Citrus shines best. However, Citrus is easy to mistake for its core and motivations. Whether this is a fault on the delivery of the story or a consequence of the story's complexity, is debatable. In that sense, its storytelling is simultaneously its strongest suit and potential deal-breaker.I watched the show on two occasions. The first time, I dropped the show on the third or so episode. Few years later, I gave it a second chance and understood it on an emotional level. And fell in love with it. Perhaps I was too young and sensitive the first time I came across the show. Perhaps I imagined the manga differently. That was when I realized I had to review this show, if only to contribute to the few who were moved by its beauty.

The animation is at times awkward. Some story arcs are lacking. Most importantly, its portrayal and dramatization can easily come across as fetishistic and/or romanticist.

This time, we're not so far behind (we're usually YEARS late) but fate makes up for it by the fact that this review will likely be on page 25 or further back of reviews, seen only by a single pair of mortal eyes and perhaps a bored Elder God or two. So hello fellow mortal and thanks for taking a moment to read this review! I will do my best to keep it up to the quality standards RTLR reviews are known for! I'll even discuss the RTLR wall of anime slobbery-kisses!Today we're going to...be talking about the oft-discussed anime Citrus. There seemed to be a lot of expectations surrounding this title (at least in the circles I move in) and there was a good bit of (mostly) unfair judgment against the show. At first blush, I also stuck my nose in the air, but after taking some time, and getting off my preconceptions, I watched the series again, and feel I can give it a much more honest grade. Of note, I am reviewing *only* the anime. I know the manga exists, and I know many readers find the manga to be far superior, and that it fills in some of the more puzzling aspects of the characters, but this isn't appearing on an 'overall media experience' page, its appearing on an 'anime review' page, so you will get just that because that is what my first hand experience covers.Story: 7I actually did enjoy the story in Citrus. There are some bumps and ruts that lower the score some, but overall they did a fair job of presenting the tale well. The synopsis explains the whole how blondie Yuzu and dark Mei come to be together, so check that for details. Blondie Yuzu is very honest in the story, and admits to having no experience in matters of love. Her story arc reflects this naivety perfectly, as she's easily confused and gets her feelings jumbled easily, just as one would expect. The dark headed Mei is even more interesting in that she has been jaded by past events and uses what she has as a weapon, even when she doesn't intend to do so. It's ingrained into her by her life. The big rub for many was that dark Mei's actions seemed out of place and out of character. Some claim she does the odd acts she does for nothing more than titillation value. I don't find that to be the case.What we have is a story of a girl (blonde Yuzu) who is wide open in her heart being brought together with a horribly scarred girl (dark headed Mei) who acts out on her feelings in ways she herself doesn't even understand. Coming together, blonde Yuzu being led so easily to true feelings for Mei, who is truly confused and just thrashing around, the pair work through all their issues and come to know true feelings. Dark Mei is very similar in theme to Shizuma from Strawberry Panic. They are both damaged girls who have learned to use sexuality as a defense, even as a weapon to protect their hearts. Mei's overtly sexual (well, kissing everyone that gets within arm's reach that is) actions actually have a well defined and explained reasoning behind them. Due to the trauma of her life, she becomes who she is. Many dismissed the anime because Mei seems so random, but I propose a more attentive viewing shows that Mei isn't just some crazy kissing lunatic, but instead a deeply hurt girl.The story of how both girls, on polar opposites of the spectrum, come to understand and accept real love is moving. I think a fair amount of people might not 'get' dark headed Mei's strange behavior because they have little experience with the kind of trauma that produces people like her. That's a good thing, obviously, in real life. Well, I've experienced and have people close to me that also experienced deep trauma, and I can say Mei acts in a manner that is authentic. The way blonde Yuzu works with Mei and handles Mei's meltdowns and such is very touching. Yuzu herself isn't sure about what is going on, or how her heart is telling her to react either, but she cares enough for Mei to keep working together with her to get past Mei's pain. Look at it for what it is, and that's a moving story. I can tell you from experience most people don't love deep enough to try to stay and help you through the difficulties that make you act out inappropriately.Now, why did I not score the story higher? Well, even though it hit me as very authentic, there are still parts that are handled poorly. I found the entire character of Matsuri who was brought in mid-way through as nothing more than a cop-out for true further emotional exploration. I also found the 'new' girlfriend brought in literally the last episodes to be completely rushed and not properly utilized.Another ding for me was a side character that is a long time friend of Mei's that is apparently interested in pursuing a relationship with her. She acts as a foil to blonde Yuzu for the opening handful of episodes. The idea of a 'normal' girl seeing damaged Mei and wanting to protect her is perfectly normal, to have her basically disappear after being romantically 'defeated' by Yuzu in the race for Mei's affections was just sloppy. Honestly, they could have also written that trauma in a manner that was more direct and could have been more easily related to by people that haven't had such dark experiences. I 'got' Mei because I know girls that have been hurt, and hurt badly, and could immediately see how Mei's behavior was that of a troubled kid. But most people don't have experience with such troubled little girls, and I think that made it harder for them to come to terms with why Mei was doing such odd things like she does. I think it caused confusion, and a story should always be written in a manner to eliminate confusion. Mystery in the plot is fine, but things that seem contrary or nonsensical are usually not good calls. I could see Mei being nonsensical (and heard as much from people) when viewed with a lens not fogged by personal trauma experience.Art: 10I LOVE the art in Citrus. Everything about how it is drawn and presented just wows me. I love the detail in the faces and eyes, love the choice of coloring. I adore Mei's purple eyes, and the small detail touches they put around in different places. I often find myself thinking as I was a new (to me at least) anime how well the art matches up to Citrus. I really do think of this series as a real standard to hold up. I can easily forget it is animation I am watching and I see the characters as real people. The backgrounds look good, the styling is smart, and the colors pop. Love love love it!Sound: 8The voices are well done. Mei's voice is very well matched to her personality. She has that dead calm, almost emotionless tone that the characters requires. Yuzu is very animated, and her voice is bubbly and fun. As the series progresses, the actress playing Yuzu does very well in accentuating the name 'Mei' every time she says it, giving the whole 'crush' on Mei a proper note in her vocals. It's like she gets a little breathless and dreamy every time she even says Mei's name. Very well acted. Harumin, who is Yuzu's best friend, is also well cast, sounds right. The mid-point antagonist Matsuri is also appropriately menacing-sounding, as much as a young Japanese girl can be (which is a LOT us anime fans know!) and over all everyone has great voices. The opening song is odd, but grew on me, and the ending is pretty and I think fits the show well enough. My ears were pleased, I think yours will be too.Character: 9Again, Yuzu's innocence and Mei's tragic past are both well written, well fleshed out. I would have given a full 10 if not for the fact that I think Mei isn't properly explained early enough for people without experience with troubled teen girls. Perhaps my own experience in knowing girls like that makes me think they assumed too much, I will admit. Guess that's why reviews are by nature subjective. I think they could have explained better for happy people, and happy people might think that Mei's trauma was explained perfectly when it needed to be. Hard to see things from the other side of the fence, you know? The girls' love for each other is handled well through their personal viewpoints, Yuzu with her sincerity, Mei with her brokenness, and the difficulty each has to go through to come to an honest account of how they feel and who they are is really well written into the characters themselves.While I do have a bit of issue with the mid-series antagonist, and the rival love interest tacked on in the last few episodes feels a bit inadequate, otherwise we're not so bad off when it comes to characters. Harumin is a wonderfully written best friend, supporting Yuzu and encouraging her when appropriate. Himeko is a bit over attached to Mei, but really does want what is best for Mei in her heart. She just happens to think it's her, and not Yuzu, of course. We don't deal in a whole lot of other characters, which I think is a pretty good call, story wise, to keep the focus a little tighter. In fact I would have pared down the last love interest, and had even fewer characters myself. There's a lot to unpack emotionally between these few characters, storywise. So thumbs up mostly for the characters too.Enjoyment: 7I did enjoy Citrus, a good bit. I found the innocent girl paired with the troubled girl very interesting, and I did root for Yuzu and Mei both to find a way to break out of their respective, limiting viewpoints and cross the divide to the feelings they obviously had for each other. I could have done with less pink haired girls, and no silver haired ones at all, but stories have to have some conflict somewhere I guess. I think for me the lower enjoyment score is purely because Mei reminded me of some women I dearly love that were just like her at that age, and were only so because they suffered some terrible things as kids. I think it was more that it brought back painful memories for me, and that of course is not the show's fault by any means, but yet again, it does factor into the overall experience. And I know I'm not the only family member or loved one of a damaged girl, and for all of you out there that might happen across this, be prepared to remember some rough times when you watch Mei and her behavior. We cannot separate our own life experiences from our opinions of things, so mine is colored by what I've lived, and those times were very much NOT 9's or 10's on the rating scale. That's why I lowered the overall slightly while still having much praise for the series.Mei is beautiful, she is tragic, and she is in pain, from the perspective where I sit. Yuzu is beautiful, and pure, and so upbeat and happy, from that same point. I found myself rooting for them to be together, Mei to find healing in Yuzu, and Yuzu to find maturity in Mei. And for them together to find a happiness that exceeds both of their shortcomings. I think I might pick up the manga for this series. When it comes to the RTLR wall of lonely hearts, I have one of Yuzu with her victory sign by her eyes (you'll know what i mean) and two of Yuzu and Mei kissing, because it has the basis of a beautiful relationship. Until next time, you guys! be talking about the oft-discussed anime Citrus. There seemed to be a lot of expectations surrounding this title (at least in the circles I move in) and there was a good bit of (mostly) unfair judgment against the show. At first blush, I also stuck my nose in the air, but after taking some time, and getting off my preconceptions, I watched the series again, and feel I can give it a much more honest grade. Of note, I am reviewing *only* the anime. I know the manga exists, and I know many readers find the manga to be far superior, and that it fills in some of the more puzzling aspects of the characters, but this isn't appearing on an 'overall media experience' page, its appearing on an 'anime review' page, so you will get just that because that is what my first hand experience covers.Story: 7I actually did enjoy the story in Citrus.

I know exactly how Yuzu feels after Mei kissed her and how shes never felt like that before. I love watching how Yuzu keeps finding excuses to be with Mei even though shes scared of her feelings. I cant wait for the rest of the series and even though its not done yet im really hoping there will be enough content for a season 2. Ive almost finished the manga and i have to say as...a fan of yuri i really cant wait for more of this. I also feel like that you can connect with the characters and their feelings such as a first love and that scary feeling of being close to them then when you eventually work up the courage it feels so great and liberating to finally get that off your chest. In conclusion i think all round this is by far my favorite anime in the romance category and one of my favorites all round if you havent watched it yet id totally recommend it to you a fan of yuri i really cant wait for more of this.

It’s definition of subtlety is listening to the Eminem Show on the stereo during a roll over car crash and because of that… it is a ton of fun to watch!Citrus is a very rare and special show that only comes around once every few years.  There are shows that are fantastic.  There are shows that are good and there are shows that are bad.  However, there are also shows like Citrus, which intentionally or unintentionally redefine the “it’s so...bad it’s good” genre.  Citrus chooses to approach this through absurdly fake characters and an inexplicably inept grasp on reality, all while unapologetically exploiting the Yuri romance genre.The first entertaining facet of Citrus are the fictitious characters, many of whom would never, under any circumstance, exist in our reality.  Yuzu is the star of the show as most every episode focuses on her and her emotions.  She is extremely obnoxious, care free, and grossly over the top to the point where everyone around her has to pay attention to her.  Much of the reason why she is so entertaining is because she is completely flanderized to the point where the show will disregard any realistic repercussions to her actions to accommodate her.  Much of the time, we see her skipping school, disrespecting superiors, and whining to others to get her points across.  However, much of the time the show considers her actions noble and justified adding to the hilarity of the show.  Much of the side cast is incredibly amusing as well.  Mei is a wildly entertaining depiction of a girl with sexual frustrations whose constant dead eyed expression and sand paper like dialogue produced many amusing “WTF?” moments.  Matsuri is a young high school girl who acts and talks like a porn star in her late 30s.  Many times the adults in the show are completely oblivious to anything happening in the lives of their young ones, which also adds to the fun because it allows the girls to work things out in their own over the top ways.  The character’s ridiculous personas are so unbashful and in your face; you cannot help but laugh throughout every episode.Another fun and ludicrous aspect of Citrus is the show’s… “Unique” grasp on reality.  Most of the time in other anime the character’s will have to change their personalities to accommodate for the challenges they have to face throughout the story.  However, as I touched on above, Citrus chooses to depict reality in an idiotic and nonsensical way to accommodate for the character’s outlandish personalities.  This means in Citrus’s reality, there are no such thing as consequences.  As with Yuzu, the other characters also choose to spit in the face of universal norms in incredibly distressing ways.  We see all of the girls, and I do mean ALL OF THE GIRLS choose to have illegal sexual relations with others, manipulate others through blackmail, and publicly disturb others by yelling and arguing with each other on more than eleven or so occasions.  However, the show decides to not only depict these acts as normal and justified but goes one step further by rewarding these characters for their criminal actions.  This depiction of reality to accommodate for the girl’s personalities and shockingly insane behavior was incredibly entertaining throughout the show.Finally, this show is a blatant exploitation of the Yuri romance genre.  As someone who rarely watches romance anime, I had no expectations for Citrus going in.  However, after the first few sexual scenes, that depicted Yuri romance as illegal sexual assault and then absurdly depicted these acts as normal and justified I was stunned.  The show bafflingly rewarded Yuzu and others when they attempted to assault Mei throughout the show.  This was even goofier because of how whimsical the writers attempted to depict these scenes.  The animation also added a strange aspect to these whimsical scenes, and by that, I mean that it is good.  In fact, the animation is almost too good to the point where much of the time the character’s expressions cannot keep up with the artwork during these scenes adding to the hilarity.  The character’s awkward expressions combined with the in your face dialogue were so insane and shameless, I couldn’t help but laugh out of being stunned over and over again at the show’s completely unapologetic attitude throughout the anime.Citrus should be avoided by the faint of heart or anyone seeking any sort of genuine romance anime.  However, its absurd reality and flagrant attitude make it a great addition to the “it’s so bad it’s good"" genre that should satisfy those looking for many awkward laughs. bad it’s good” genre.

Then I started watching it. The visual is nice, there nothing to say about that there. But the story... first, and the most important thing, this anime/manga ROMANTICIZE sexual agressions while it is far from acceptable. I’ve watched a lot of anime to know that rape culture is something too common in animes/mangas. And I’m tired of it. Romanticising sexual violence leads to people (and I think about young girls mostly) thinking it’s ok, that if it happens to them it is normal, that it...is nothing big and that it is fine to agress someone else. Well it is, and the way Mei, Yuzu and the others (even if there’s a part a love or whatsoever) do things without the other’s consent is wrong, and very annoying to watch. Big deception. Second, all this insest thing is quite disturbing but again too common and romanticised in animes etc.Anyway, that kind of anime’s/mangas, in times like these where there is too much sexual agressions/rape etc in the world, should seriously stop. How can someone even romanticise that when victims are destroyed in real life ? For god’s sake... so irritating is nothing big and that it is fine to agress someone else.

Perhaps it was just Yuzu's character design and the ever present blushes. I'm a cheap date apparently.Full of generic characters, and a nonsense story line it is really not worth your time....and if I could have mine back too, that'd be great.additional characters required...surely an anime like this doesn't required much typing to describe, rate and review. At best it is fluff and fantasy wish fulfillment, which isn't always a bad thing and the animation isnt really all that bad - high praise, I know. "", ""My first anime review, but I think I have some valuable thoughts.I wasn't sure I'd enjoy a Yuri anime, and this show isn't ashamed of what it's about. The girl-to-girl is somewhat aggressive especially in the beginning of the series and this may put off some, but if you don't dislike that type of anime in particular, I'd say try this series because the character development is interesting to watch. At first, Yuzu and Mei protagonists are cringe-worthy, but then the show tactically gets you to empathize with and root for them over time.The anime has a nice and modern art style and the...music is catchy. Everything kinda rolls up together making a nicely delivered modern-slice-of-life-anime package that emphasizes story-telling, character development, and plot twists.At the very least,  USE THE THREE-EPISODE RULE. I would even dare say it'll hook you later than that, maybe episode 4 or 5. But don't throw it out if you've only seen the first episode, because this is worth it to ride out if you give it a chance to change your mind. I stuck with it and am happy I did. music is catchy.

But this time, I want to do something different. Citrus is a anime I really don't like, but I have thought about why I don't like Citrus past season. And after a season of thinking and Citrus releasing its final episode, I have come up with the 2 big problems this anime has.Problem 1: The first impressions you get from this anime is badThe first four episodes are immediately the worst episodes of...Citrus. All of those episodes contained incest sexual assaults and awkward pacing. This in a weird contrast to the later eight episodes which are different, but also contain their own problems which I get into later. If you wanted to watch a drama with a lot of emotions, you will get turned of by the first four episodes.Problem 2: The relationship between Yuzu and Mei constantly gets resetThis needs a bit of explaining. Yuzu and Mei are the main characters of the story and the romance between them is the focus of the plot. ''So what is the plot?'' you may ask, well here it is: Mei or Yuzu get feelings for eachother, they get closer to eachother, Mei or Yuzu decides that this isn't good, distance herselve of the other and their relationship is back to square one. Repeat four times until the end. This excuse of a plot is not only lazy, but also frustrating. It feels like the author of Citrus didn't know how to make one string of building up a relatioship and just decided to build up the relationship four times.To be honest, this anime is not completely bad. The animation really fluid and the music is also pretty good, but everything else just frustrates me (including those two problems I mentioned). I do not recommend watching Citrus, but if you still want to watch it, then get ready for incest, blackmailing and rape. Citrus.

None of them feel like they have any reasoning behind what they do other than to just make things happen for the sake of it like a shitty sitcom. The sisters introduced later in the story are just wow...

THAT SAID, this series ended up being better than I thought it would.For some reason, every studio seemingly insists on hitting you hard with the overtly perverted vibes early on, which will probably be off-putting to anyone new to anime or to this type of genre. Underneath all of that, though, is something of a story about struggling to convey emotions and dealing with societal/family expectations. The writers ended it in a way that gave some closure, but left the story open for continuation. I wouldn't...be too surprised if we get a second season late next year.The opening theme is good, as was the score. There was occasional ugly animation, but that can be said most series, so we'll call it the norm. Overall, fairly pretty, and fairly enjoyable if you're into romantic dramas. If not, it's probably best to pass this one up. be too surprised if we get a second season late next year.The opening theme is good, as was the score.

The author uses it as a plot device several times without really exploring how serious the matter is. I wouldn't blame anyone for holding it against the anime as it's a dissappointing part of an otherwise enjoyable series.Animation - 7 - Citrus not bad but not great. The anime doesn't have amazing production values or an ambitious style. Citrus has neither but it's characters are attractive, distinct and well drawn, the environments are fine and the animation's smooth. It won't win any awards or catch people's attention on its own, but the overall production doesn't hold the anime back either.Sound - 7 - Music and effects are fine, though not particularly memorable, although the anime was never hinging on either as the hook.

However I think Saburouta kind of put it to waste when she start recycling jealousy drama... But that critc fits more the Manga, since the anime didn't went that far on the story.At first glance the Anime is visually beautiful, nice colors and character design that translate well Saburouta style, but at second glance, the amount of bad CG on the background is depressing.Op and Ed are great, one of my favorites of every Anime, can't get tired of listening to...it. On the other hand the background theme get repetitive sometimes and it is easy to noticed that they are trying to force a dramatic climax using the music.As I said the original story is great but kind of waste it's potential by repeating dumb jealousy drama, the anime adapted 3 of those repetitive arcs, but the first family conflict arc and the father arc are really good, and of the jealousy arcs the Matsuri is my favorite, because she is cute. Also the anime kind of disfigured some key plot points of the Manga, which was kind of upsetting, for exemple the scene where Yuzu give Kumagoro to Mei is switched for Mei's father giving it to her.Overall, it is an enjoyable Anime to watch if you don't want to think much about it. it.

Indeed, the relation between the 2 main characters remains modest and patient, nothing gets too quick. It is more about discovering, understanding each other slowly with passion.Nevertheless, what makes it special is that the love story happens between 2 girls (not uncommon and not forbidden where I live, so it did not shock me at all)... who are also sisters. Basically, Citrus brings both homosexuality & incest but in a soft way ; understand that it does not promote any sexual orientation but gives a kind of tolerance message to all viewers.Actually, everything opposes the 2 girls : one being a fancy lazy blonde and the other one being a serious cold-heart acting school girl with high responsibilites. This is at first a duel between 2 different classes and way of life. However this aspect quickly disappears to concentrate on the purest romance plot.The anime includes 2 triangles of love which will help both characters to highlight some of their personal aspects. I found them interesting and relevant but a bit poorly exploited. Actually, Citrus was a good show to watch but it did not bring me tears and torment my thoughts for days (unlike some stories like Nozoki Ana, which is an erotic romance / love story I loved ; you can find my review on my profile). Some viewers surely found it heartbreaking on some points or very arousing / attractive ; well I did not but it does not mean the whole show was bad.Indeed, our main characters' love story is not characterised by a single line where everything goes well, no no. Yeah, it should be drawn as russian moutains, with high deceptions but also joyful moments (with a happy expected ending, as you can guess watching the opening). Perhaps knowing from the start how it would end impeached me to fully enter the story. I also think the fact they intended to build relations with many characters (they all are secondary but still have a great role) created an interest for... too many characters in fact. To be honest, my attention was caught by the other girls lol, not saying that Yuzu & Mei were not well designed, eh.At the end, I am convinced the ending satisfied most viewers (an happy ending usually does so) but my hunger / interest was not repleted, however. In fact, I expected more, something like an 'after war' moment, where both girls act as a new created & official couple. Some might say the story leaves this upcoming (Citrus has done being aired or published, do not expect more) part to my own imagination... probably right, yeah.Well, it was still a pleasant 12-episode show to follow, even if it didn't reach my heart I enjoyed discovering a controversial love story.

There are clear influences of Freudian Theories on the overall story and can be used to explain the choices and characters in the story. For example, both the protagonists, Yuzu and Mei must be considered physical representations of the positive and negative Oedipal Complex concepts. In addition to this, the subtle nods to primitive psychology are present throughout the story. Clearly the Christmas cake scene and the behavior of the characters within the setting can be explained through...a deeper analysis of the more well placed details many viewers may ignore. The strawberry base of the Christmas Cake can be used to explain the behavior of the two titular characters through the fact that strawberry is a natural aphrodisiac and unleashes the primal yet provocative inner repressed natures of the two.

Can it be enjoyable at times? Sure. Are there decent yuri scenes? Sure. Is it a good show? I can see the appeal but in my opinion it\'s not a good romance and has extremely unrealistic characters and forced plot points.Story 3/10:The plot covers mostly the two main characters Yuzu and Mei and how their relationship develops. Their ""relationship"" abruptly starts with Yuzu being sexually assaulted by Mei in front of their school.......Yea sounds like a real great romance already I know. Later Yuzu finds out that Mei is now her step-sister and gets assaulted yet again.But the amazing thing about Citrus is that the sexual abuse isn\'t even the worst part. As the show progresses there\'s not one, not two, but THREE love triangles thrown into the midst. Personally, I loathe love triangles; they\'re rarely done well and are usually terrible and feel like forced plot points in order to create drama. Citrus is no exception to this, majority of the drama in this show comes from the uncertainty in Yuzu and Mei\'s relationship and the drama that the numerous love triangles provide. It\'s almost like the writer had no idea how to progress the relationship between Yuzu and Mei at all and decided to throw in the love triangles in order to progress the relationship and the story. It doesn\'t feel natural, it feels forced and unrealistic.So yeah, a romance that revolves around sexual abuse and love triangles is not a good one to me. There are some redeemable moments and a few times where the relationship actually progressed somewhat but those moments were overshadowed by the forced drama.Art / Sound 6/10:Animation and sound were average, nothing looked bad and there were even moments where the animation looked pretty solid which is why I\'m giving this a slightly above average score.Character 3/10:Most of my problems with the story are related to the characters themselves and the decisions that they make for the sake of advancing the story. Hence this gets the same score as the story, I\'ll cover a little bit more of why I disliked majority of the characters in Citrus. Yuzu and Harumi were probably the only 2 characters I didn\'t outright dislike in the show.First let\'s start out with Mei. Mei is your cold ""student council president"" type character. Throughout the story she has a problem with expressing her emotions and is both physically and emotionally abusive to Yuzu. She\'s overly cold and overall a shitty person. Personally I hated her, she was manipulative, abuse, and overly reacted when she didn\'t get her way.Next let\'s cover the three love triangle members, Matsuri, Himeko, and the Tachibana sisters. None of these characters added anything worthwhile and were in the story pretty much for the sole purpose of creating a love triangle in order to progress the story and  introduce drama. Matsuri was an evil (Not going to spoil what she does, but it\'s pretty appalling especially considering her age) middle schooler, Himeko was an uppity brat, and the Tachibana sisters felt like they were there because the writer had no idea how to close Yuzu and Mei\'s relationship issues.To summarize my thoughts on the characters: When 3/4 of your supporting characters are there simply for the sake of creating drama with love triangles it\'s going to be an absolute dumpster fire. None of these characters saw any meaningful development, the story progressed the same for all 3:Character introduced -> Love triangle causes relationship issues between Yuzu and Mei -> Triangle gets resolved and now said character supports Yuzu and Mei\'s relationship.Because of this and Mei being such a loathsome character I\'ll give the characters a 3/10.Enjoyment 5/10:I gave this a higher score because it was actually kind of entertaining. I didn\'t get bored of the show and while the plot points were pretty bad, I found myself interested in seeing what would happen next and if the show would somehow redeem itself or turn into even more of a dumpster fire.There were also some decent yuri scenes, and as a fan of the genre I appreciated that.Overall 4/10:Citrus is poor as far as romance goes - there\'s no way a romance based solely off of abuse and love triangles can be good. But at the same time the show remains somewhat entertaining despite being such a bad romance. If you decide to watch this show, don\'t expect a good romance / drama and you might come out enjoying it so some extent. That being said, I still wouldn\'t recommend this unless you can find enjoyment in watching trainwrecks or if you like yuri so much that the story doesn\'t matter at all.

The problem is that it takes up on homophobia and the taboo of girl liking girl. But it feels like they start this conversation towards the end and never finishes it. Indeed, multiple time we can hear the characters saying that it's weird for a girl to like a girl (hi internalize homophobia) and when Sara appears she says that she likes whoever she likes, boy or girl it doesn't matter. They...could have pass a great message. However what Sarah says doesn't hold much importance in the anime. There is one flashback to that, but the subject stays taboo and this is the only sentence stating that wlw relationship (women loving women) shouldn't be forbidden.Other than that Sara and Nina were not well included in the story, which makes them appear as filler. Matsuri could've been a really good character, but we don't see enough of her. What does she really do? What was she doing the first time we saw her? Other than that she is well made.This show questions love and relationship (what is really love?). And we can see Yuzu grow on that, she understands more and more what love is as the show goes. We also see a bit of family love with Mei and her relationship with her dad. However it was botched: we don't really see Mei and her stepmom interacting which is too bad and the talk Mei had with  her father is like a dot in Mei's story.And even if Yuzu's point on view on love has changed her relationship with Mei is just weird. First of all because they are related and live in the same house. Second of all because it's too pushed. Yuzu really insisted and you shouldn't harass someone to confess your love.In the end I think the anime was too short, it looks shoddy.

It was frustrating at times watching how Yuzu deals with her feelings though.Art was pretty good. Nothing negative to say about it at all.The sound was good, too. I'm not an expert when it comes to this. I mean I enjoyed the noises the girls made when engaging in... sexual activity? That was awesome!Characters... I think this is where the show somewhat suffered. There was nothing wrong with the characters, of course. Apart from Yuzu being a dumb ass at times. I just think there are some...characters that should have had more development. Fortunately, it seems Citrus might get a second season eventually... Since apparently, the manga is pretty long. Can only hope.I enjoyed it. It wasn't a masterpiece or anything like that, but it was pretty fun.

It starts off really interesting but like so many anime fails to deliver at the end.The story is weak, basically a lesbian relationship that gets stretched by challenges, it teases you with the promise of two people getting together which is common in other anime too.The thing is that there\'s not really a backstory to one of the main characters, leaving you to wonder why she is acting this way, and it\'s never explained apart from her saying that it\'s just how she is.There were parts where it got interesting, but it just went unexplained.Holes in...the story, that frustrate you.Characters that seem to know everything from another character when they just met.A highly unpredictable character that is unpredictable without reasons.So much more that\'s wrong with this anime.All to arrive at a ""they lived happily ever after story"".To be fair, there are things like the interactions that felt really realistic and they did a good job on those and i found it at least enjoyable to binge watch this, however it\'s only worth watching this when you like to be teased with relationships, and don\'t mind being disappointment in the end.Spoilers -->>The part with the pink haired juvenile wanna be pimp confuses me the most, how does she know just by looking at Mei that she\'d kiss just about anyone, and that she\'s twisted like that. And WHY in FREAKING hell does she just casually get away with blackmailing her into being a hooker and instantly gets forgiven by yuzu. ALSO we don\'t know how Mei dealt with her ""client"" either, no way in hell that he\'s just gonna walk away from free sex like that. the story, that frustrate you.Characters that seem to know everything from another character when they just met.A highly unpredictable character that is unpredictable without reasons.So much more that\'s wrong with this anime.All to arrive at a ""they lived happily ever after story"".To be fair, there are things like the interactions that felt really realistic and they did a good job on those and i found it at least enjoyable to binge watch this, however it\'s only worth watching this when you like to be teased with relationships, and don\'t mind being disappointment in the end.Spoilers -->>The part with the pink haired juvenile wanna be pimp confuses me the most, how does she know just by looking at Mei that she\'d kiss just about anyone, and that she\'s twisted like that.

Something lighthearted, with little to even no plot, just some amusing action and characters that make me smile. That\'s when Crunchyroll recommended me something that looked like a really average yuri, taking place in an all-girls school, with the main character realising her preference for girls in an unusual and a bit too stretched-out way.I clicked ""watch"", without giving myself a chance to second guess.What happened...next is a mess full of:- yelling at the screen on which characters argued for another time- blankly staring at the wall because I needed a breather- explaining to my friends why do I make such a big deal of some random anime that made me question my views on morality of relationships- and finally, those short moments of satisfaction, when the couple I (and I still feel a bit guilty about it) wanted to get together, got a moment for themselves.Seriously, while it seems like yet another show about girls falling in love in embarrassing circumstances, Citrus made me think about what is right and how far can we draw the line, the border, between the socially acceptable (at least in the ideal world) love, and this other confusing feeling that almost everyone experiences in one way or another - lust, awakened by accident, by someone we should not be sexually interested in.But what\'s more - we get real characters! Characters with personalities, unique traits, motivations... We believe in them. We relate to the confused Yuzu, who tries to understand sensations that Mei gives her, to Mei, who tries her best to act indifferent but it\'s hard when she is just so starved for any form of affection and acceptance. To Harumin, who wants the best for her friend. To Momokino, who only needs a tiny bit of attention from someone she cares for.We also have a chance to see a lot of differences from other usual romances. You can see how surprisingly many interactions between characters is consensual, how much you can hear about importance of your other halfs feelings and, what I think is the most valid lesson we can learn from this gem, how huge is the role of communication. Seriously, I even started doubting if I myself, am a good partner!Okay, I said a lot of good things but, unfortunately, I can\'t let you think that this emotional rollercoaster of anime series is perfect. Because it is not, in any way.I can easily blame the fact that there are only twelve episodes, and that\'s the whole reason for how rushed the plot seems to be sometimes, but it wouldn\'t be completely true. Unless I assume that the creators weren\'t aware of how many episodes they have to cover with some extremely well-written dialogues and an ILLEGAL amount of sexual tension (which is obviously NOT what happened), I have to admit that they\'ve messed up.A lot of smaller plots had to be opened in order to create a believable relationship between main characters but they never got the chance to be finished. Sure, we can imagine that every single obstacle that Mei and Yuzu overcome during they pursuit to find their real love, magically disappears after being ""defeated"". But that\'s just not how life works, I can name at least four characters and three shorter plots that were literally BEGGING to be explored. If you know you won\'t have time to finish them all in a satisfying way, why would you create them from the start?The visual side of Citrus is just good. Yuzu is definetely the best drawn character in the show, while others tend to melt together because of how similar they are. It\'s cool though, I believe that that is what the creators wanted.So in the end, even if it\'s not a must watch, neither is it an anime you watch with the primary purpose of watching this particular one, I highly recommend giving it a shot. Because there are some real emotions hidden in this little, but definetely not so cute, love story. next is a mess full of:- yelling at the screen on which characters argued for another time- blankly staring at the wall because I needed a breather- explaining to my friends why do I make such a big deal of some random anime that made me question my views on morality of relationships- and finally, those short moments of satisfaction, when the couple I (and I still feel a bit guilty about it) wanted to get together, got a moment for themselves.Seriously, while it seems like yet another show about girls falling in love in embarrassing circumstances, Citrus made me think about what is right and how far can we draw the line, the border, between the socially acceptable (at least in the ideal world) love, and this other confusing feeling that almost everyone experiences in one way or another - lust, awakened by accident, by someone we should not be sexually interested in.But what\'s more - we get real characters!

(Just made that up). Like it tries it\'s damnedest to be a genuine lesbian relationship series. But fails all the same.The way it starts is repulsive and I don\'t blame anyone for not watching it for that reason. It\'s ridiculously stupid in its writing at those points. In fact, it\'s writing overall is pretty bad. Excluding the Mitsuri Arc (which I actually really liked cause I\'m more so drawn to a good villain than a good hero), the writing is abysmal. Just bad. So herky jerky and...way too reactionary. Going all the lines of ""ok, what\'s the most dramatic thing that can happen right now"" and then doing it. It\'s ""drama"" is so forced and fabricated.The characters are plain dumb and make stupid decisions. Yuzu going back and forth so much causes major whiplash and makes next to no sense. Especially the last arc, the School Trip Arc, like ouch. Hit a dud with that one, and after such a good climb with Mitsuri. Smh. Mei is one of the most heartless characters I think I\'ve ever seen. Her in beginning episodes is just plain evil. Sexually assaults Yuzu more than a few times.But of course, Yuzu comes crawling back. (Back to the bad writing). The supporting cast is not too bad actually. Harumin is a sweetheart and a shining beacon of hope in the pile of crap. As I said, I actually liked Mitsuri, probably my favorite character cause she\'s such an evil bitch witch, and so hammy with it that I just have the biggest evil grim on my face when she\'s chewing scenes.However, speaking from a technical side of things. It\'s actually pretty solid over there. Like the newer studio Passione really nailed the animation and music. It\'s really well done. The opening and ending songs are really good, and the way the violin music is incorporated is flawless and definitely amplifies things when the soundtrack is in full swing.So overall, this is now the example for me of ""style over substance"". It fits that mold so well it\'s crazy. Bad writing and dumb characters. But some amazing music and good opening and ending songs. So I\'ll give it a 6/10. way too reactionary.

But definitely give this a try and dont miss the opportunity like Yuzu kept doing because in the end you will regret it when you find out what all youve missed because you were being a grinch.we binged this. and we did so without having an agenda, without relating this to the real world and seeing this as a hateful anime that is trying to justify stupid things that are actually bad. this is simply...an anime about real life. The other people who finds this pushes an agenda are the ones who are hypocritical in every way of their life, while doing nothing more than trying to act like something they are not for the world to see.This anime is good enough to have you feeling the feels, while loving and hating the characters at the same time. when they make a character so cruddy, and so evil that they make you hate them, is that really a bad character? NO, thats a damn good character. and the trash that happens in this anime is what happens on a day to day basis. Now in terms of love, sex is a thing. but what people explain happens in this anime isnt what happens. an anime about real life.

I mean, I started it as a joke, but it turned into something I started watching.Story: Citrus\' story is a bit out of place. It has a basic goal that has Yuzu trying to find out her feelings while also trying to mend/build up what she has with Mei, her step-sister. Although the premise seems easy to follow, the events seem like they\'re not planned that well. You have your events that occur throughout the year, but some that seem important are just left behind, never to be seen again. However, even with that, they did still manage...to keep some previous scenes relevant, like the Christmas episode. That episode was referenced multiple times, and became the basis of Yuzu\'s actions later on in the show. However, that isn\'t enough to save Citrus from its story flaws.Art: The art in Citrus is something I\'m not really used to, so it did come as a surprise. Characters just look more detailed, as more emphasis on what characters look like is needed for this show. This makes characters like Yuzu and Matsuri stand out, but some others are left in the dust, being applicable to Mei. She doesn\'t seem to change clothes themes, which makes her seem more forgetable when compared to her step-sister. Besides the characters, though, backgrounds were crucial for this show. Some were nicely detailed, but that didn\'t translate into some of the ""less important"" scenes. Most scenes were something that I could look at and see the detail, but there were some that didn\'t quite maintain the standard that this show had shown.Sound: I felt that sound was mostly solid, although a few characters felt a bit off with voice acting. Music was ok as well, but unlike Slice of Life series that I\'m used to like Oregairu, I don\'t really recall any of the background songs used in this show. However, I can say I grew fond of Azalea, the opening. Sound is overall good, but I did feel it could have improved.Character: Well, this is where I have the most problems. Character was hit or miss in this show. Mei was done the way she should have, but I do feel that her cold exterior interfered with my watching experience. She made some scenes that should have been resolved in one episode drag on for more, but that\'s not the worst. The worst for me was that they had characters with potential that they just seemed to throw away to the side. I mean, Matsuri was a character that became a main component to dissolving whatever Mei and Yuzu had as a relationship, and they just set her aside to give Yuzu inspiration. She could have been used for more, much like Himeko. They both may be side characters, but they had a big impact on the two\'s relationship. With that said, what did Citrus do right? Well, they did a few things that I found to be good. Yuzu\'s struggles with understanding Mei and her actions went on long, but they were done correctly. Her overall development from this event helped her in the long run, although affecting Mei in a different way as well.Enjoyment: Despite my criticisms, Citrus was enjoyable for me. I don\'t know what it was, but even with its flaws, I still came back every week to watch it.Overall: Citrus is not a perfect or the best showcase of what a yuri manga adaptation can be, not by any means. It has its flaws, but it also has some successes. Its writing can get weird at times, but it all ends up making sense and comes together later on in the series. If you\'re alright with yuri (why would you be on this if you weren\'t?), and you\'re alright with its story, give Citrus a go. However, if you\'re on the fence whether it be because of the story or yuri itself, I\'d advise you to set this series aside. to keep some previous scenes relevant, like the Christmas episode.

The anime wasn't that story based and it was more like she don't like her.. she like her.. now there is problem and we need to fix it. It was confusing but love is confusing sometimes. There was enough action to say it's not boring. I liked the elements of this show.. first drama then romance, fun.I mentioned manga. I must say it's really correct to original and they don't add any non-logical things addapted to it.Art style was really amazing. I liked how they...look, impression of first seen like their aura.Character were awesome. Again i can say by their look, charisma, acting, talking.Enjoyment was really good too. Changing from drama to romance to fun do action and again.. i enjoyed it.Overall by diameter 9.5It's my opinion from a guy who like yuri action drama.. so it will not be probably your cup of tea but whatever, you watched it because yuri right? / ok maybe something else ;) look, impression of first seen like their aura.Character were awesome.

If Im honest I found myself getting a headache once nearing the end..Story- The story itself was rather straight forward and if Im honest annoying, It had alot of repetitive content assaulted love that always ended with the other not being interested, Roles reverse then ends the same way other girl not interested all of the sudden..Girls become close only to have a third wheel come along and try to ruin it..So repetitive and really just a headache to watch in one sitting.Art- The art...was fine sure it had some stupid scenery and the same backround girls doing the exact same thing throughout the anime, walking..But nothing bad.Sound- I liked the music probably this animes strong suit the music added atmosphere to the whole anime.Characters- Now this is when it gets bad..One of the main girls  I could not stand she was annoying and just so confusion, I found myself sighing with each screentime she got..Considering she was one of the main girls it really wasn't good..Hard to enjoy an anime where a main character is just annoying and not fun to watch.. Not to mention the side characters where boring and a sore to watch also. The only character I liked was Yuzu who was pure until the end.Overall I'd say this is one of the better Yuri animes out there true it has alot of down points but for 12 episodes it did keep me hooked until the end, I wish I could of liked it more but yeah I cant see myself watching this again and if for some reason a season 2 does come out, I cant find myself watching it. was fine sure it had some stupid scenery and the same backround girls doing the exact same thing throughout the anime, walking..But nothing bad.Sound- I liked the music probably this animes strong suit the music added atmosphere to the whole anime.Characters- Now this is when it gets bad..One of the main girls  I could not stand she was annoying and just so confusion, I found myself sighing with each screentime she got..Considering she was one of the main girls it really wasn't good..Hard to enjoy an anime where a main character is just annoying and not fun to watch..

Yes, I know how it sounds like I hate this anime just by opening my review with that, but that isn't (entirely) the case. The truth is, my feelings towards Citrus are rather mixed. It didn't exactly offend me as much as other FAR worse shows have (referring to SAO, of course), but I just can't help but be disappointed by the overall show.One of my biggest gripes with the show is its writing. At times, the writing can be quite solid and give a lot of emotional depth...to the situation being presented. But most times, the melodrama is quite forced and eventually just gets tiring to keep up with.The one thing I hated the most about the writing (and about the whole show, actually) was the nonconsenual elements. These acts serve no purpose to the overall plot, and seem to have just been included to grab the auidence's attention. That being said, it makes the show (particulary the first half) so uncomfortable to watch. Had these elements not been present, I probably would've enjoyed Citrus a bit more.Another big issue I had with Citrus is its characters. I won't exactly get into detail with the side characters, but I will say that most of them were boring, and the ones that served as the antagonists for a brief while were quite annoying. The characters I will be discussing in further detail are the starlets of our show: Yuzu and Mei Aihara.Yuzu Aihara is probably one of the best protagonists I've encountered in the little amount of romance anime I've seen. Throughout many times in the shows, she proves herself to be an emphathetic character in how she interacts and cares for others. Despite this however, she also has her flaws, as she can be arrogant and a bit of a jerk at times. This actually made her more realistic and relatable to me, and I really liked her as a character. I just wish I could say the same for her goth girlfriend.Mei Aihara is a dull, and overall, unlikeable character. She barely has any personality aside from staring with a constant deadpan expression and an adherence to filial piety. The little personality she does have is that of an awful, manipulative molester. I was hoping that I would grow to like her as the story progressed, but I just ended more sick of her character by the end of twelve episodes.Even as someone who has taken half a year of chemistry in high school, I could tell that there was practically no chemistry between the two at all. Their whole relationship dynamic is unhealthy (as it all began with the aforementioned nonconsensual elements) and feels terribly forced. It's incredibly hard to care about a love story when one of the characters is unlikeable, and that is exactly the case with Mei Aihara. The only reason for them being an item is because the story says they have to be an item, without any justifiable (or healthy) cause. What does Yuzu see in this girl that makes her even worth pursuing? The obvious answer is nothing, and its a shame that Yuzu couldn't see that as well.Aside from my long and incoherent rambling on the story and characters, I would also like to briefly discuss the sound, art, and my enjoyment.The art is lovely. Even for all the girls in uniforms, each of the characters have a fair amount of design that distingusihes them from each other.The sound is fairly decent. I didn't care much for the opening, but I kind of like the ending theme.Overall, I have mixed feelings towards this show. I can't say that I liked it, but I won't exactly say I hated it either. (Though it may seem that way.) Had it done some things better (like a more even narrative and better characterization for the side characters and Mei) and done away with some others (removing the nonconsensual elements, for example), I would've enjoyed it a bit more.

I was hoping for girls consensually kissing, girls discovering their sexualities, family bonds being re-tied, reserved people making friends…but I clearly expected too much.The main reason that I rated Citrus higher than my review might suggest is because the art style’s beautiful and I was able to push aside a lot of the things that bothered me, to a certain extent. Citrus also has a lot of potential, which is why I’ll probably be reading the manga in hopes that it can offer me everything that the anime didn’t.Let’s start with the most obvious problem....Why the flipity fuck has Yuzu not met the man who her mother’s supposed to marry? I know this happens in a couple of anime, but it never fails to piss me off. Like, who was at the wedding? Did the mum just run off with some guy for a few months then come back married? I need a justification.That point aside, Citrus starts off with the potential for a very interesting plot line but then spirals down into a tedious, generic story.Mei has daddy issues, people try to get in the way of their relationship and that’s pretty much the entire plot.The first four (or was it six?) episodes are very enjoyable and they had me seriously anticipating the next stage- the moment when the plot was going to get real deep. It didn’t happen. Those first few episodes focus mostly on family dynamics, but the moment Yuzu realises her feelings for Mei, it becomes a case of other girls getting in the way. Over and over again, that’s all there is: two episodes centring around one girl who wants to separate them, then the next two centring around another girl who wants to keep them apart and the cycle’s never-ending.In some anime, sexual harassment’s not talked about as an issue. To enjoy these, there’s a need to acknowledge that what’s happening’s terrible but still look past it. I know. Not an easy thing. But it’s the case for Citrus. Mei, Yuzu, and multiple other girls touch and kiss each other without consent- when the person’s vocally and physically resisting their advances- and I was hoping that this anime would actually talk about it, seeing that it’s a recent one. But no. Shitty excuses are given and the affair’s never to be mentioned again. In fact, it’s kinda romanticised. Nevertheless, as much as it disgusted me, I managed to not let the sexual harassment bother my watching experience.There’s, ironically, a serious lack of discussion about sexuality. I first thought that Yuzu was straight- seeing the way she fawned over boys- and hoped to watch her discover her sexuality. Then, because she accepted her crush over Mei so fast, I assumed she was bi. But then, suddenly, in the later episodes, she pulls out the infamous line: “Liking girls isn’t normal.” Excuse me- what? Where did this come from? And the worst part’s that this statement never comes back again! I was so confused! Are you questioning your sexuality? Are you homophobic? Are you already bi?The characters truly are the saving grace of this anime. Well, their relationships are. The friendship dynamics are heart-warming (Harumi’s friendship goals, the girl seriously deserved more screen time) and the conversations are amusing enough. There’s just not enough of it. The series is so focussed on Mei and Yuzu that the interesting relationships I actually cared about were explored so little.Individually, the characters are well fleshed out, but again, just like this entire anime, not enough. I wanted to learn more about them as people, instead of how horny they were. Mei’s a meh main character; Yuzu, though, is a protagonist worth talking about…Yuzu’s the typical high school girl who loves fashion, going out with her friends and cooking (She’s actually referred to as “the perfect wife”- I shit you not- I wanted to throw up). Despite her slightly trope- filled personality, I enjoyed her character a lot, thanks to her daring attitude. However, that attitude quickly withers away as she spends most of the episodes, her head in her hands, whining about Mei, Mei and Mei. The latter’s the only thing on Yuzu’s mind, to the point that she could look at a fucking table, or a bright orange lamp and somehow draw a parallel to her sister. I’m not sure if it’s an illness or a superpower.Here are some un-canon things that Yuzu would surely say:“Oh look a floor- Mei walks on floors”“Hey there’s my old friend, I wish that Mei was my friend *cries*”“Let’s go to Karaoke- Mei doesn’t go to karaoke’s…”. Why the flipity fuck has Yuzu not met the man who her mother’s supposed to marry? I know this happens in a couple of anime, but it never fails to piss me off. Like, who was at the wedding?

The only way I can describe it is if Kill La Kill was a Slice of Life romance anime and the romance was between Satsuki and Ryuko. This show does not understand romance let alone Lesbian Romance. I only got to episode three but I can not continue this show, any pretense of a good romance are completely ruined for me by the show starting out with one of the two supposed romance characters sexually assaulting the other multiple times, with the text mistaking it for affection. I personally can only give this anime 1 star despite any other positive...qualities it may posses it's entirely ruined for me and is not worth watching on any grounds by the way it treats it's character's. qualities it may posses it's entirely ruined for me and is not worth watching on any grounds by the way it treats it's character's."", 'TL DR and lack of spoilers: It\'s cute and sweet but is far from an impressive piece of art. It\'s particular problems are a repitition of the same general conflict and the sexual-assaulty way Yuzu and Mei start off their relationship.How I got to this point:I finally got around to finishing this anime at the dawn of the new year mainly because of the manga. I got impatient with wanting to see what happened with the story as to was airing so I saught out the manga, caught up with what I had watched in anime form and quickly started to get annoyed at the...plot, and promptly dropped it (I\'ll explain why a bit later). I did finally pick it up again as I was busy with personal things but I also don\'t want a story to stay unfinished in my mind.The story:It\'s difficult to explain what I liked and disliked about a story without explaining the story, so I summed it up in the beginning if you want to avoid me spoiling it for you. This is also the lion-share of my review so you have been warned.The Citrus anime, imo both benefits and suffers from not adapting the entire manga. While I have not yet read the whole thing myself, the reason why I stopped is also the way I think the anime improves on its sourse material - too many girls are in love with Mei or Yuzu. I stopped reading the manga after the forth coflict in a row was revealed to be ""this girl is in love with one of the main couple"". I was like: ""Oh come on! DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"" The anime thankfully stops at the third one but I think the story would have been better for it if they had dropped one of the three - Himeko\'s being my choice.The story also has a problem right out of the gate as well. I mentioned at the start that I have some misgivings about how Mei and Yuzu start off their interactions and the topic is concent.Yuzu first encounters Mei on her first day at her new school when Yuzu unknowingly violates the dresscode and is confronted about it by members of the student council at the gate. Mei being the council president sees this and conducts a quick search of Yuzu\'s clothes for her smartphone as it is off limits to carry a phone into the school grounds and confiscates it. I didn\'t take this bit very seriously as I though the sensual way in which it was shown was intended to be taken as Yuzu\'s perspective and that she was just taking it as more sexual that it actually was (Mei was just looking for her phone after all) because she didn\'t realize she was into girls yet.The real problematic part is when they are at home and Mei, completely out of the blue pushes Yuzu on her back and gives her a very long kiss. This is another instance of sexual interactions under dubious concent, unfortunately common among yaoi works of fiction as well. It\'s rather hard to judge whether this was against Yuzu\'s will or not - at one point she starts kicking and knocks over a case of make up, on the other hand when the two of them finally part lips they are both visibly out of breath so it could be that Yuzu was only struggling because she was running low on air. The anime (and, if I\'m not misremembering, the manga as well) makes no attempt to clarify which is it and just leaves it up to interpretation. I\'d rather go with the lack of oxygen as it means that Yuzu isn\'t in love with a family member who sexually assaulted her.Their next ""romantic"" interaction comes up after they fall into a pool of water outside and need to take a shower together. Mei makes another unambiguously sexual advance on Yuzu who this time pushes her aways but doesn\'t bring up the issue of whether or not that kiss was consentual and instead only wants to ask about the mixed messages she\'s been getting from Mei. The story keeps side-stepping the issue instead of adressing it but I\'ve seen much more blatantly rapey interactions between romantic couples in anime so it\'s thankfully not that bad.The plot-point about Mei\'s grandfather was very good but I think it came much too early in the story. It\'s the first conflict after Yuzu and Mei meet and what flows it is 3 of the same conflict back to back, it would have been much better passing to have it happen in-between 2 of those, preferebly as the second-to-last conflict as it actually has by far the highest stakes.These last few have been factors it shares with the sourse material, but I do need to bring one particular scene in the manga as I think the show is worse off for not having it.The story opens with Yuzu chatting with some of her female friends about her transfer and in the manga she meets up with them again. At that point she\'s pretty sure she\'s in love with Mei and during that second conversation, the two girls she\'s talking to show that they have some pretty overtly homophobic views. This really hammers home the point that a lot of people would view even her interest in girls as unnatural much less her step-sister. I don\'t remember the manga very clearly, but I\'d be shocked and disappointed if this point in particular goes unadressed. It\'s a very real conflict with very real stakes no matter how it is dealt with.But I criticize because I care and I recognize that there is merit to the story the writer is trying to tell. At the core of it is the question ""What is love?"" not just ""Will they get together?"" as it usually is in this genre.The art:There isn\'t really much to talk about here. The animation is basic for the most part - nothing that will blow your mind, but nothing distractingly bad that I\'ve noticed. The animators did put in a bit more effort than the usual for an anime in the characters eyes. And any credit regarding the design of the characters themselves, with is good btw, would be due to the sourse material. There is a bit of same-face syndrome going on here with the girls, but that\'s all really.The sound:... Is not my forte of analysis, so I\'ll leave this one alone. I gave it a 5/10 because the tracks did stand out too much to me and I can\'t really say much about it.The characters:This links with my opinion of the story itself as while it does iritate me that so many characters are just third wheels (... or forth... or fifth) to the relatioship we follow, I will grant points here for at least making them feel like seporate characters that go about splitting the main pair in different ways and different reasons for liking the one that they do. This goes a long way to mitigate the problem with the same-y conflicts.My enjoyment:I found it an overall enjoyable show despite the times when it annoyed me and I didn\'t find the ambiguity of concent here as problematic as it could have been and it happened only at the start of the story and other interactions were much more clear cut with how consentual they were. plot, and promptly dropped it (I\'ll explain why a bit later).

The idea of “Citrus” is mostly unrealistic in it’s general concept and presentation of the series which touches on potentially sensitive subject matter, and without separating the show from reality, it may be troublesome for some viewers to comfortably sit through the series, never mind enjoy it.While this subject matter was not an issue to me, it most likely was to many viewers, hence the scoring being below a seven on MAL when most potentially “bad anime” to the general...population can generously receive a seven or higher. However, the use of this subject matter or the way it’s presented doesn’t reflect my score of “Citrus”, I just personally see many flaws in other parts of the show that made it exceptionally less enjoyable overall.“Citrus” by many of it’s top rated viewers praise the series on it’s strength in story progression and character development, which I personally saw little of. Though I am aware of it’s adaptation being a manga, and have not delved into the manga myself, this may have been the issue with the adaptation in terms of the lack of progression in story and characters. Potentially as by much of the audience who have read and watched the series said it adapted much of the mange “well” or “correctly”, it may have also adapted some of the manga’s issues, however I’m not too sure myself.The storyline in “Citrus” didn’t progress much farther off than the issue from the first episode: whether Yuzu or Mei would get together. And yes, while this is typically an okay concept for a twelve-episode anime to cover, the progression made it seem like as soon as they should be together, something (most commonly a character) got in their way and their feelings resulting emotion and overall progression of their relationship went back to square one, over and over again. I personally felt as if I watched the first and twelfth episodes of “Citrus” that would be the story, and everything in-between had minimal to no impact on the storyline after the “arc” was over and was like it hadn’t ever been an issue in the first place.Like the storyline, this is what created ineffective side characters in “Citrus” and though yes, side characters are often introduced to progress the plot, they never really did. I felt as if I could go into “Citrus” without meeting the majority of their side characters and that would completely be fine. One after another, a side character was introduced into the story as a block between Mei and Yuzu’s relationship, and once that was settled everything went back to normal, and they either a) never appear again, or b) remain supportive of Mei and Yuzu’s relationship like they just could’ve been to begin with. Even major characters such as Yuzu and Mei have minimal character development themselves until the last episode, while in-between after every conflict any progression we saw from either disappeared.So, while lack of storyline and characterization was an issue for me, one thing that kept me around in “Citrus” was the fanservice. And while many criticize its consistent use of it throughout the anime, I felt as the way it was presented was the only thing that kept me interested, as it was so raw and often did have reason through the plot.However, apart from this, there’s little I can praise of “Citrus”.If you watch anime purely for the enjoyment, while that be in “Citrus” through fanservice, a yuri relationship, or what have you, this anime will surely interest you, and I highly recommend as one of the “Guilty pleasure” watches. Otherwise it’s not positive you’ll find much enjoyment through this anime through the use of storytelling and plot development.However, by the end of “Citrus” I personally believe the entire audience may question why it’s called that in the first place. population can generously receive a seven or higher.

Avoid this show if you respect your free time. "", ""Seriously this is the best Yuri anime after strawberry panic, we need more Yuri series like this, that can make us feel all kind of feeling and can relate to the story, we don't need Yuri series where girls have bouncy boobs or whatever, this series and the manga are the best so far in my list, and I keep searching for similar series but unfortunately no other series can top citrus.let me know what you think and if you agree or disagree to my review.let me know if there is anymore anime or manga similar to citrus. "", 'Demo-D would be ashamed for this sorry excuse of a yuri show. First, I\'ll say that the show looks nice in my opinion at the very least but if you want to watch a good looking show, just go watch Violet Evergarden. I haven\'t personally watched it but at the very least I can guarantee that it would be a much better experience than what you would get here.On the other hand if you are like me and was mainly here for the yuri, I will say that this show is not worth it at all and there are far better yuri shows out...there like Sakura Trick which is basically a high-school yuri romance like this show but without all of the things that makes this show shit.As for everything else, this show is very uncomfortable to watch because it basically goes by the logic of ""It\'s not rape if they\'re both girls"". Even if you can get pass that what lies ahead is nothing but generic characters and the same boring ass romance plot that we have seen ten million times but the only difference is that they are girls.Overall, this show has many bad qualities that I likely haven\'t even covered and any good qualities that this show has are done much better in another show. I think I am being extremely generous to give this a 4/10. This has been my first review so I\'m sorry if this was unhelpful but I probably need to watch more shows to get a better understanding of how to do reviews.Update: Lowered the score to a 3/10 since it better describes how I feel about this show. there like Sakura Trick which is basically a high-school yuri romance like this show but without all of the things that makes this show shit.As for everything else, this show is very uncomfortable to watch because it basically goes by the logic of ""It\'s not rape if they\'re both girls"".

Mei is cold and calculating and will kiss anything on two legs ( sounds like scums wish) but then there is the aloof Yuzu who makes this anime fun and exciting.  So.... lets get to the nitty grittyStory: a 7 and here is why,The story is modern and we are a modern society and we have had so much of the same sex rammed down our throats it is sickening but where the plus in this story is the romance that develops or should I say feelings between Yuzu and Mei although in the beginning it is one sided and Mei does come around but where the story lacks is the development of Matsuri, Nina, and Sara in my eyes for the story to be a 10 all three girls should have been established early on.Art: 5 - nothing to really catch the eye for this anime. The CG is terrible not like any other anime i seen as of late If this were a Navel or a Okamoto style anime then the art would be more detailed.Sound: 8 - This has the good 70's and 80's music feel that I do like and it sounds clean and well polished but not at good as the music of ClannadCharacter - 5 here is whyThey spend way too miuch time on Mei and Yuzu when they could have developed other relationships around Yuzu or Mei, also they did not do Nina, Sara or Matsuri any justice either. I felt these characters came in way too late, we should have seen a budding relationship between Mei and Sara, and heck who knows Yuzu could have ran into a cute guy while at the mall in Tokyo, and any rate the characters are way underdeveloped and maybe a second season is needed to focus more on these characters one will never know unless the god of anime deem it so. My point is the characters towards the end lack development and need to be expounded on more to make the story one you cannot quit watching.ENJOYMENT - 8 - HERE IS WHYI enjoyed this anime it was fun and sometimes sad with a twist of romance of the same sex, The facial expressions are good and the sense that it had a story to tell was there the one of same sex unrequited love. so it was somewhat enjoyable to watch.Overall a 7Pros - a funny romance story featuring two step sisters and whole lot of extras. This could have been well thought out and more episodes needed to tell the story but I do believe it strays from the manga and rushes several characters. More episodes are needed to do this it should have been a 24 episode anime instead of 12 so that better character development can  take place I would watch this if you are sick of the main stream anime ( except Bleach) of course. So if this type of story does not offend you give a watch. not ask to be thrown together but this is what happens when mom marries dad if you will. Mei is cold and calculating and will kiss anything on two legs ( sounds like scums wish) but then there is the aloof Yuzu who makes this anime fun and exciting.  So.... lets get to the nitty grittyStory: a 7 and here is why,The story is modern and we are a modern society and we have had so much of the same sex rammed down our throats it is sickening but where the plus in this story is the romance that develops or should I say feelings between Yuzu and Mei although in the beginning it is one sided and Mei does come around but where the story lacks is the development of Matsuri, Nina, and Sara in my eyes for the story to be a 10 all three girls should have been established early on.Art: 5 - nothing to really catch the eye for this anime.

In many moments I felt that Yuzu was being stupid just for the plot, some reactions were too forced, Mei otherwise was too confidential about her emotions and the reason isn't something crazy like I thought before I knew about her reasons. The last point is the secondary characters except for Mei's dad, they are really empty and felt like filler that appeared when we needed the gears start rotating. About the art, is really awesome even though the manga's one is way better. one that we can understand completely her mindset.

The main character is basically just a thirsty high school anime girl that wants in her new stepsister\'s pantsu entirely because she stole her first kiss. Now i\'m all for ideas revolving around the fluid nature of human sexuality, but that sounds like a bit of a stretch. Especailly in almost every scene before the kiss, she\'s stupid boy crazy. Almost always complaining or asking about the lack of guys at her new all-girls school. Which would be fine, if yuzu was seen spending  more time mulling over her sexuality than...""I kissed a girl and I liked it"" so i\'m gay now. It just feels unrealistic to be honest. Though given that same token im a cis-het man so id say its more than fair that my opinions on that are less than adequately informed.However! Where this show truly fails is the aftermath of the kiss. Where the stepsister, consequently the actual most intruiging character in the show, is made to put up with typical harem trope bullshit from her sister and childhood best friend, (Up to and including attempted sexual assault by episode 5) that I really feel she should be the only character in this show. If this show followed a loner high school president with MASSIVE and I mean MASSIVE daddy issues who basically is forced to move from home to home throughout childhood due her papa-san\'s delinquency from responsibilities.

Although the material is there, after all, Yuzu does struggle with her feelings and identity, that's all there is to it.This is the typical pseudo-incest love story, which I have no issue with at all. The protagonist Yuzu is...likeable, she's aloof and reckless and for once found myself enjoying this personality type especially when in stark-contrast to her step-sister Mei. Mei is the girl of a few words, the silent type. But there's a fine line between writing an observant, introspective character and a bland,robot that is devoid of feelings or reason. This is where Citrus starts to falter.There's no communication between the characters, they are both supposed to understand each other's feelings via psychic abilities (which by the way, none of them have). Instead, we have a bunch of sexual harassment scenes which will might make the viewer uncomfortable or confused. In Citrus' defense that's how such a situation should feel, so it does that well.

Simply put, it\'s a not blood related sister lesbian show, and it focuses mainly on that romance. I could honestly put myself past that. I\'ve watched Oreimo and Eromanga Sensei, however, two things did it in for my enjoyment of the show.1. The sexual assault man. We all know anime that have them, and honestly we expect some at this point. But I felt like I needed to go back to confessional at the...end of some of these episodes. It\'s straight up borderline rape in some of these scenes. While another person might appreciate the ""forcefulness"" these characters have, I unfortunately cannot say the same.2. When I said ""soap opera"" like nature, it goes beyond the problem anime usually has. Most anime have some sort of ""rubber-banding"" where the main problem is almost solved but then back to almost square one. I\'d argue that many good shows avoid this, however it\'s an incessant problem in Citrus. You\'ll have characters not regressing to square one, but new ones come in out of the woodwork every single time to thwart the main romance. It\'s almost ridiculous how half of Tokyo is out to fuck one of these two sisters.I can\'t say that the animation or art style is completely garbage, because it was pretty decent.

', 'Caramba this show truly pissed me off. I love slash, femmeslash, yaoi and yuri it if done well like in ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"" but here? This is just bad. I really wanted to like this show but I gave up after watching five episodes and here is why. This is not a story about love but sexual assault. Both girls either assault or are being assaulted by someone else (a teacher, a ""best friend""). There isn\'t a single instance where any of the sex doesn\'t look like dub-con or flat-out rape (what Himeko does to Mei - that was rape. Mei didn\'t enjoy any of...it and was completely messed up after it). There is certainly no love anywhere. There is also no real story and not a single character that one can feel sympathetic for. Also, serious plot holes that make no sense. How the hell did the parents of those two girls end up married in the first place when Mei\'s father is constantly anywhere but in Japan? Did he advertise somewhere - ""need a mother for my teenage daughter, since I can\'t be arsed to take care of her myself""? This anime reminded me of ""Kuzu no Honkai"" which I tried reading but gave up after being utterly disgusted by all the characters.

For the most part, the characters were pointless. Harumi doesn't change and by the end doesn't seem at all important to me, Matsuri prevents plot development and is in general an unlikable character, and so do Nina and Sara prevent plot.

They had great moments built up very well. And the art was enjoyable too. They made the pacing go really well and had so much story invoked that I had to read the manga after catching up to the ongoing series. Honestly I really hope they make a season 2, as it gets better from the next chapters/arc that is happening in the manga right now. I rate this series an 8/10 because I felt like it could've had a bit...beter music/sound and while characters were all very interesting, sometimes they didn't have as much emotion in some scenes compared to their manga scenes. Overall though, I liked it! A very fun watch for yuri fans. I recommend people to give this series a try tbh. :) beter music/sound and while characters were all very interesting, sometimes they didn't have as much emotion in some scenes compared to their manga scenes.

With that being said, I’m a very simple person when it comes to anime, if the show is interesting, I’ll watch it through to the end. If at any point, I feel like the show isn’t going anywhere or I find the characters bland, I’ll drop it, however, this has only happened once.When it comes to Citrus, it was the first Yuri anime that I...have ever seen. Hell, I didn’t even know what the genre was until I found this anime. Yuri aside, I adore romance stories and I’ll be damned if this is not once of the best romance anime’s I’ve seen. The character’s personalities and emotions were so bold in every single episode, it left me wanting to see them grow more and more and understand their past experiences as an explaination for them. Yuzu’s and Mei’s story are extremely compelling and easily relatable and I think that’s why I loved this anime so much. These sisters are in an incredibly awkward position, loving each other not because they are sisters, but because they are exactly what the other person needs in a relationship. They are each other’s missing pieces to their own personal puzzle and its just so adorable.After I finished the anime, I was left wanting more, so this is the first time I actually purchased the manga. It was the best decision I have ever made because the manga goes SOOO much more in depth about our beloved main characters and the story continues onward! I can’t wait for the rest of the manga to be released now and I’m very much hoping that they come out with a season 2 for Citrus, it honestly deserves it.TLDR;Story: Pretty generic, step-siblings meet each other, fall in love and so fourth, however, the delivery of the story for this show was very unique which deserves Kudos. 7/10Art: Surprisingly very pretty. The color’s were amazing and everything in the show was visually appealing. 9/10Sound: Something that gets overlooked very often but this show does a pretty good job with sound queues. The background noise is always subtle and suitable for the enviorment, music was on point enhancing the emotion in each situation and the voice acting was amazing. 9/10Characters: Mei and Yuzu are two of my favorite characters in romance hands down. They both have their obvious problems and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them both grow as indivuals. The supporting cast was also spectacular, Harumin best girl.  9/10Enjoyment: Again, I can’t stress enough, I have never been more satisfied after watching a pure romance anime. If anyone wanted a recomendation for Romance, I’d recommend Citrus in a heartbeat. 10/10Overall: If you love great art style, charming character delivery, romance and that delicious yuri action, look no further than Citrus.

Every interaction is an emotional roller-coaster; you never know whats going to happen!! As each episode comes to an end you are basically forced to watch the next as the cliffhangers are phenomenally done. The art differs from mainstream anime in a way that can be appreciated. The character design is surprisingly unique and visually appealing. All the characters look remarkably different which just shows the attention to detail in this anime. Speaking of characters, each and every one serves a great...purpose to the plot and pushes it forward in a compelling way. The plot itself is quite possibly the best I've seen in any anime. It pulls you in right on the first episode and does not let you go until it has ended, leaving you stunned by its elegance.To conclude, this anime succeeds in every category. The excellent art, plot and characters lead to an overall delightful experience. All I can say now is that incest is wincest. 10/10 IGN purpose to the plot and pushes it forward in a compelling way.

It also has quite a bit of fan-service, yuri and a few 'love scenes' with rapey overtones.If you're still reading though, I found the characterisation to be spot on, and after a few episodes I was emphasising for the characters and sharing in their highs and commiserating with their lows.The story is nothing out of the ordinary, with no real twists and turns. The art is nicely done. But it's just nice to watch characters you care about through their misunderstandings and trials through to a happy ending....Enjoyable rubbish I have no regrets about watching.

The characters are VERY VERY VERY exagerated but that's expected but I think what really makes the protagonists (semi) compeling is the conflict about expressing their feelings or not and that is writen well enough that you can get invested although I believe the show focuses to much on...the protagonist and her lover when the could/should have explored the surrounding characters tieing it into the main plot but that's just me, 12 episodes doesn't leave a lot of room for that. I don't criticise art or sound because it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the show and gets the point across.Overall, I would recomend this to someone that likes romance anime and that can look past a lot of the shows short comings, doesn't mind a lot of lesbian fan service (or just embraces it ... that also works) and that has a lot of time (because don't be dumb like me and make time to watch this show) the protagonist and her lover when the could/should have explored the surrounding characters tieing it into the main plot but that's just me, 12 episodes doesn't leave a lot of room for that.

first yuri types show that i ahve watch since im still somewhat new to the anime world.Story is kinda a generalized types romance with a pinch of dark side i hear a lot of people say that series or the author misunderstand between romance for rape. from what see i don't quite agree with others saying that the character or the scene displaying forceful rape. my understanding of rape is that one person is forcing sex on to the other and committing intercourse for where as i see i can confer that it is displaying of sexual harassment...but the problem you can really call that either because the character yuzu  has been confused of the sexual identity or have never thought of a women in that way. back on track here is that the story goes along with these to character yuza and mei are learning a lot about themselves and each other  i find that it was very good in the sense of character developmentCharacter there not really much to say here for as it a bit genericYuzu i like yuzu to a point she can be a bit much at time and other times you would tend to like her because you cans see her develop and growing up as a person seeing thing from  different prospective and learning other feeling especially understanding meiMei now i really like this character for as she is a unique character some of you may not think so but she a quite girl who kinda tend to keep to herself and yes there a bit of daddy issue but in this case it works i mean Mei is a very caring person but h as a hard time expressing herself and she does some odd thing that would make you think like  why would she do something like that or other time you be like wow she amazing and strong will character. i found myself rooting for Mei a lot throughout the series because i feel that she just wanted to be loved and accepted for who she is that wanted to be depended on.Art/sound the art is actually pretty good  i like the overall character designed although and it may just be me but yuzu  character for odd reasoning her kness is heavy pink kind throw me off sometimes i just thought it was weird for me to look or you may not have a problem but the show is show watchable and the other character design are great and as far for the music goes it was generic and no real feel to it or give the series an emphasis that it may need but it still okay for what it is.overall i did enjoy watching this series even when yuzu can be a straining at times but Mei it what keep me through to the end and i guess i care about there character development and relationship growing strong together as the series went on i am satisfy with the ending and you may feel the same about it as welli would recommend this   if your into a good character development or a interesting romance that doesn't quite follow the

When I watched it my first time honestly I was just watching to pass the time but after ep 1 when a certain incident happened I felt my eyes slowly glue to the screen. Not only that but every time one of my family members passed...by me they would take a picture and when I finished citrus they would show me pictures of me crying but I never noticed them taking the pics or me crying till it was all over.

My rating is a 10 out of 10."", 'When life gives you a rising demand for yuri and a presumably meager budget to capitalize on it, you make Citrus.I can\'t help but begin by addressing the one widespread criticism of Citrus, the whole idea of \'romanticizing\' or \'normalizing\' sexual assault. Unless I missed it, there was never a disclaimer at the bottom of my screen telling me that \'there is nothing wrong with sexual assault\' and \'is it really a big deal at all?\'. There\'s some fundamental misunderstanding going on here, and repeatedly, the subject of this, in the world of entertainment, is at least related to sexual assault. You don\'t really see...anyone criticize superhero movies for \'advocating vigilantism\'.  It\'s easy to see how dumb the argument looks when you say it about violence or any other crime but when it\'s sexual assault, it becomes so much less obvious to some people.The truth is, the show never tells us whether any of the actions of any character are good or bad. That\'s not, in my mind, something a good show ought to be doing at all. The purpose of the show is to tell a story, and it\'s the duty of the viewer to come to conclusions about the actions of its characters.Moving on to an actual review of the show, Citrus was a pretty interesting show. It\'s biggest flaw was that some parts felt very inconsequential to the overall story, added just to drag the show a couple episodes longer. It could\'ve scored an 9 simply by omission, perhaps something that could be said about many an anime series, but I digress.Story:  Apart from what I just wrote, there was absolutely nothing special about it. But it didn\'t have to be. A show can be good despite its ending being set in stone for the viewer, and I think Citrus did a pretty good job of that. ""Yeah that was obviously going to happen"" was never really a complaint of mine because Citrus did a pretty good job of keeping these moments interesting enough.Art & Sound: The art was okay at best, and the cgi lacking. The sound however, in retrospect, despite initially never striking me as particularly good, was the key constituent of the heavy atmosphere Citrus excelled in creating.Characters: Varied widely, but Mei definitely the best. Much more than any typical, overdone archetype; she was unique. She comes off as somewhat of a psychopath, but without it feeling like a forced negative trait, unsure of how to express herself, confused about her own feelings, with a lack of respect for either her nor Yuzu\'s body. Yuzu herself, while not being a very unique character initially, certainly experienced an adequate amount of growth and development. The supporting characters were by and large, very lacking in all aspects, but massive props to any anime that has two main characters anywhere as near good as these Citrus does.To sum it up, this show isn\'t just some guilty pleasure for any softcore yuri fans that it\'s widely made out to be, nor is it some flawless masterpiece of the genre. Citrus certainly does some things right, and I only wish it was better, because it certainly could\'ve been. anyone criticize superhero movies for \'advocating vigilantism\'.

I've watched Sakura Trick, Bloom into You, and Adachi and Shimamura. Of all the three shoujo ai anime I watch, none of the are the same. All of them have their own charm, their own interesting plots and characters, as well as visual works. For example, Sakura Trick does not have fancy animation or really detailed drawing, and it basically has no plot, but the comedy is really good. Bloom into You has little to no comedy, but the story is very well written. Adachi and Shimamura combines both elements, with plot not less heavier than Bloom into...You, but has a bit of comedy here and there, however no kissing scenes. Now that I finally had the time to watch Citrus, I can finally say what it is, what it isn't, and why it isn't as horrible as people make it out to be. So let's get into it.Story.The story is centered around Aihara Yuzu (Yuzu for short) and Aihara Mei (Mei for short) who recently become siblings, due to their parents remarriage. Yuzu is a basically a gal, heavy make ups, stylish uniform, as well as blonde hair (dyed, obviously). Mei, on the other hand, is a diligent student, admired by everyone in the school as well as the president of the student council. The way Yuzu acts and dresses really bother Mei, because Yuzu is breaking the school rules with how she dresses. Long story short, the two become siblings.You get the idea. Two high school girls standing on the opposite sides of the poles living together under the same roof as siblings. The whole premise of the show can be summed up this way: Yuzu acts nice towards Mei, Mei ignores her, Yuzu feels sad, Mei suddenly, out of nowhere springs and kisses Yuzu, Yuzu gets pumped up, Mei says she will not do it again. That's what you'll get from watching the whole 12 episodes of this series. There's almost no progress on their relationship, because whenever something that can improve their relationship shows up, the show always manages to take two steps back, so what you get is this back and forth between problems without anything being solved.Most, if not all, the conflicts on this show is due to Mei being ignorant and arrogant towards Yuzu's kindness and affection towards her. Even on the very first episode, Yuzu is trying to be nice to Mei, and what did Mei do in return? She kisses Yuzu out of nowhere, which serves as the main reason all the conflicts will show up in later episodes. I don't think such trigger is bad, no problem here.The only problem I have with the story is how every episode ends with a cliff hanger, even when it's not necessary. The way the characters solve the issues they encounter always takes too long, even though the solution is very simple if they just talk to each other. That's how they solve all issues here; they make everything overly complicated and convoluted, while you know exactly that that's not the case at all. I hate when an anime does this because making simple problems overly complicated is horrible, especially when the viewers know it. That's the only problem I have with the story.Art.The art is nothing but gorgeous. The characters, backgrounds, animation and everything are top notch. A lot of things can be said about Citrus, but let it not be said that it has ugly designs. Amongst the Shoujo ai anime I've mentioned previously, this easily surpasses every single one of them. The design of the characters are unique, and you can clearly tell that.Just form one single glance at Yuzu, you will know that she's a gal, likes parties, wears make ups, and doesn't do well with strict rules. You look at Mei now, you can tell in a second that she's a diligent however doesn't speak a lot type of girl. I'm going to talk more about the characters later on. The scenery on this show is top notch, too. The only little issue I have with it is how empty all the places are. I get that they're trying to make Yuzu and her friends as the focus, but I hope they'd add more people just to make them less empty. Even Yuzu and Mei's room look empty. They may have a slightly larger room than most high school students, but it really feels just too big. Other than that, it's all good.Kissing scene is where Citrus really shines at. Honestly speaking, Citrus has the best kissing scenes amongst all Shoujo ai anime I've watched up until now. You can say anything you want, but the kiss scenes are out of this world.Sound.Nothing outstanding from the sound in this show. The voice actress for Yuzu is Taketatsu Ayana (an amazing voice actress, one of my favorites) so you can picture how she sounds like. I think it's very fitting for Taketatsu Ayana to voice her, because I can't think of any other voice actress who fits for the job. Mei's voice, however, is very... low. I don't mean that she has a deep voice. I mean she speaks so low I can barely hear what she's saying most of the time. The side characters, other than Harumi, nothing really out of this world. There's one character whose voice is very annoying, but she doesn't have that many screen time so I'll let it slide.The opening though, is different. Citrus has one of the best opening songs I've ever heard. The lyrics really match the concept of the anime really well. Even if you don't know what the lyrics are, you'll still know that it slaps very hard.Character.Now this is where I think the show goes downhill. We have Yuzu, a very lovely and caring older sister of Mei, who's just there to make Yuzu's life a living hell. When I first saw Yuzu for the first time, I thought she was going to be tsundere, loud, unreasonable and childish one, but boy was I wrong. Yuzu is the older sister and she shows it to us in every episode. There is not a single episode goes by without Yuzu being wholesome and affectionate towards her friends, and Mei. I think she's the nicest older sister anyone can hope for.Mei, though, I hate her. I hate her with every single inch of my body. I told you that Mei makes the living hell out of Yuzu's life, didn't I? That is not an exaggeration. Mei really does love torturing her older sister mentally. I talked about this a little bit in the story section, but all Mei does is reject any help Yuzu proposes to her. Not a single help from Yuzu that Mei honestly accepts without making songs and dances about her trivial stupid issues. I know that the point of her character is to be this cold hearted, example for everyone type of girl but on the inside she has a fragile heart, and is in need of lots love. That would make sense, if Mei does not refuse/stomp Yuzu's love towards her to the ground. For this reason, I declare I really dislike her.I'm not going to go too detailed explaining the side characters. Harumi is basically the best and the only legit wingman of the show. She listens to Yuzu's problems and actually gives proper advice on how to solve them. Basically she will go extra miles if it's for Yuzu. Matsuri is the most annoying character in the series. She acts cutesy in front of Yuzu, when in reality she has these devilish plans under her sleeve just to drive Mei away from her beloved Yuzu even if it means of hurting Yuzu in the process. It's like her only reason for being there is just to grind your gears and makes it seems that Mei has a rival. Himeko, I have nothing to say about her. She's the childhood friend of Mei and that's it. Other things she does include the following: driving Yuzu away from the president, driving Yuzu away from the president, driving Yuzu away from the president, and being annoying while she's at it. That's all I have to say about the characters.Enjoyment.While this series is full of annoying characters, has a weak plot and dumb problems, I have to say that it's actually enjoyable. I watch one episode per day, to be exact, just before going to sleep. I did not want to binge it and have a half-assed opinion on it. The thing I very much enjoy in this series are the kissing scenes. The studio really knows how to make hot, girl-to-girl kissing scenes.Conclusion.In closing, I would like to have my final review on the show as a whole. Citrus is far from the word perfection. It has many flaws here and there, but is an entertaining series as a whole. If you're expecting deep, complicated story about siblings falling for each other, then this is not for you. If you want to watch Citrus, just make sure that this show is not any of that. The drama is not great, the story is not great, the only redeeming characters of the series are just Yuzu and Harumi, and other flaws I've mentioned in previous points. However, this show is even farther from being called trash. I think people expected some very serious drama and deep explanation behind Citrus, and were disappointed because it failed to be what they wanted it to be. I get that. That being said though, changing the way how you view the show will help make the show more bearable to watch, or more interesting at the very least.So, the question is: is Citrus worth watching? Yes, it really is. You, but has a bit of comedy here and there, however no kissing scenes. Now that I finally had the time to watch Citrus, I can finally say what it is, what it isn't, and why it isn't as horrible as people make it out to be. So let's get into it.Story.The story is centered around Aihara Yuzu (Yuzu for short) and Aihara Mei (Mei for short) who recently become siblings, due to their parents remarriage.

There's almost no progress on their relationship, because whenever something that can improve their relationship shows up, the show always manages to take two steps back, so what you get is this back and forth between problems without anything being solved.Most, if not all, the conflicts on this show is due to Mei being ignorant and arrogant towards Yuzu's kindness and affection towards her. Even on the very first episode, Yuzu is trying to be nice to Mei, and what did Mei do in return? She kisses Yuzu out of nowhere, which serves as the main reason all the conflicts will show up in later episodes. I don't think such trigger is bad, no problem here.The only problem I have with the story is how every episode ends with a cliff hanger, even when it's not necessary. The way the characters solve the issues they encounter always takes too long, even though the solution is very simple if they just talk to each other. That's how they solve all issues here; they make everything overly complicated and convoluted, while you know exactly that that's not the case at all. I hate when an anime does this because making simple problems overly complicated is horrible, especially when the viewers know it. That's the only problem I have with the story.Art.The art is nothing but gorgeous. The characters, backgrounds, animation and everything are top notch. A lot of things can be said about Citrus, but let it not be said that it has ugly designs. Amongst the Shoujo ai anime I've mentioned previously, this easily surpasses every single one of them. The design of the characters are unique, and you can clearly tell that.Just form one single glance at Yuzu, you will know that she's a gal, likes parties, wears make ups, and doesn't do well with strict rules. You look at Mei now, you can tell in a second that she's a diligent however doesn't speak a lot type of girl. I'm going to talk more about the characters later on. The scenery on this show is top notch, too. The only little issue I have with it is how empty all the places are. I get that they're trying to make Yuzu and her friends as the focus, but I hope they'd add more people just to make them less empty. Even Yuzu and Mei's room look empty. They may have a slightly larger room than most high school students, but it really feels just too big. Other than that, it's all good.Kissing scene is where Citrus really shines at. Honestly speaking, Citrus has the best kissing scenes amongst all Shoujo ai anime I've watched up until now. You can say anything you want, but the kiss scenes are out of this world.Sound.Nothing outstanding from the sound in this show. The voice actress for Yuzu is Taketatsu Ayana (an amazing voice actress, one of my favorites) so you can picture how she sounds like. I think it's very fitting for Taketatsu Ayana to voice her, because I can't think of any other voice actress who fits for the job. Mei's voice, however, is very... low. I don't mean that she has a deep voice. I mean she speaks so low I can barely hear what she's saying most of the time. The side characters, other than Harumi, nothing really out of this world. There's one character whose voice is very annoying, but she doesn't have that many screen time so I'll let it slide.The opening though, is different. Citrus has one of the best opening songs I've ever heard. The lyrics really match the concept of the anime really well. Even if you don't know what the lyrics are, you'll still know that it slaps very hard.Character.Now this is where I think the show goes downhill. We have Yuzu, a very lovely and caring older sister of Mei, who's just there to make Yuzu's life a living hell. When I first saw Yuzu for the first time, I thought she was going to be tsundere, loud, unreasonable and childish one, but boy was I wrong. Yuzu is the older sister and she shows it to us in every episode. There is not a single episode goes by without Yuzu being wholesome and affectionate towards her friends, and Mei. I think she's the nicest older sister anyone can hope for.Mei, though, I hate her. I hate her with every single inch of my body. I told you that Mei makes the living hell out of Yuzu's life, didn't I? That is not an exaggeration. Mei really does love torturing her older sister mentally. I talked about this a little bit in the story section, but all Mei does is reject any help Yuzu proposes to her. Not a single help from Yuzu that Mei honestly accepts without making songs and dances about her trivial stupid issues. I know that the point of her character is to be this cold hearted, example for everyone type of girl but on the inside she has a fragile heart, and is in need of lots love. That would make sense, if Mei does not refuse/stomp Yuzu's love towards her to the ground. For this reason, I declare I really dislike her.I'm not going to go too detailed explaining the side characters. Harumi is basically the best and the only legit wingman of the show. She listens to Yuzu's problems and actually gives proper advice on how to solve them. Basically she will go extra miles if it's for Yuzu. Matsuri is the most annoying character in the series. She acts cutesy in front of Yuzu, when in reality she has these devilish plans under her sleeve just to drive Mei away from her beloved Yuzu even if it means of hurting Yuzu in the process. It's like her only reason for being there is just to grind your gears and makes it seems that Mei has a rival. Himeko, I have nothing to say about her. She's the childhood friend of Mei and that's it. Other things she does include the following: driving Yuzu away from the president, driving Yuzu away from the president, driving Yuzu away from the president, and being annoying while she's at it. That's all I have to say about the characters.Enjoyment.While this series is full of annoying characters, has a weak plot and dumb problems, I have to say that it's actually enjoyable. I watch one episode per day, to be exact, just before going to sleep. I did not want to binge it and have a half-assed opinion on it. The thing I very much enjoy in this series are the kissing scenes. The studio really knows how to make hot, girl-to-girl kissing scenes.Conclusion.In closing, I would like to have my final review on the show as a whole. Citrus is far from the word perfection. It has many flaws here and there, but is an entertaining series as a whole. If you're expecting deep, complicated story about siblings falling for each other, then this is not for you. If you want to watch Citrus, just make sure that this show is not any of that. The drama is not great, the story is not great, the only redeeming characters of the series are just Yuzu and Harumi, and other flaws I've mentioned in previous points. However, this show is even farther from being called trash. I think people expected some very serious drama and deep explanation behind Citrus, and were disappointed because it failed to be what they wanted it to be. I get that. That being said though, changing the way how you view the show will help make the show more bearable to watch, or more interesting at the very least.So, the question is: is Citrus worth watching? Yes, it really is."", 'this is my opinion this anime is great i love it! to people who do not like citrus or yuri anime please read the story or watch the trailer before you watch it for to be sure you want to watch it. meny citrus fans out there wanted a season 2 due to low rating it is impossible to have season 2 i already read the manga its very sad that a season 2 has not yet renewed but us citrus fans will not give up we will still wait for season 2. well the characters are very great also the animation to the chracters...there is a vibe a cold person and a energetic one i love the characters there is a vibe a cold person and a energetic one i love the characters', 'my review: 7/10I\'ll rate the anime in these categories:1. gayness 2. complexity of the main characters 3.relationship4.overall feel1.VERY GAY, gayness everywhere. good representation, characters obviously know that love between two girls isn\'t the ""norm"", but other than that it was just a series about regular drama surrounding love, just like it would look like if they were heterosexual.2.I this the characters were definitely complex, but the main character, Yuzu, lacks interests and any other ""life"" accept for the romance. Mei on the other hand is a very complicated person, with a life goal, supported by a backstory and contradicting feelings-like a real person.3. I...personally don\'t really dig the romance between them. at first i think they enter this sort of grey area, as it would be if they were step sisters, but soon after that i find Mei\'s behavior annoying, because it was the same thing over and over, yet Yuzu\'s reactions were normal and understandable, considering Mei\'s actions. Just when they both get the chance to explore relationships with another person, it pained me that Yuzu didn\'t even consider that option and put her admirer aside! That is a great plotpoint the creators missed, because without it, the existence of that character was actually unnecessary and didn\'t add anything to the main plotline accept for the fact that Mei got a little jealous one time. Shame!4. Overall it was a show based on the trope ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING STEP BRO?"".

This series may be the most debated over yuri anime of all time (Candy Boy is worse but lesser known). It is known for being controversial due to it being stepsisters who have just met along with some nonconsensual advances. Not every anime series especially yuri has to have characters without flaws. I am not condoning what happens in Citrus, but any of the major criticism online stops at those points.I think everyone approaches this with well this is not a healthy relationship or representation, the show is awful. I think people who have not read the manga and went in blind...were expecting it to be a wholesome show and are upset that it is not what they wanted a yuri anime to be. Yes, the anime community is starved for girls love, but not all of it is going to be amazing, perfect love stories.Now let's get down to the anime content and quality itself. The art and soundtrack are really stunning. They are some of the best seen from a yuri series. My main issue is with how rushed the series was. Squeezing it into twelve episodes was not beneficial.

Anyways, when I found Citrus and watched the first episode I was over the moon happy because I thought that I finally had found an anime I really could relate to on a personal level. Because of that I developed fond feelings for it as I watched the next 2 episodes. But after a while, I started to realize that Citrus really didn\'t make sense for me. I thought...it was a little bit confusing how they decided to portray love with the scenes they included.It was almost like they mixed up love with assault? They continued with this until the very end of the story. Don\'t get me wrong, I like when you show love through action and all that stuff, but throughout this anime it was almost like there only was action and no sincere words from the main characters towards each other that usually makes the watchers hearts melt in another way.Also, I don\'t think you ever had a chance to get to know Mei enough. Even in the end of it, I still didn\'t get why Mei did certain stuff at certain points. Like for example at the end when she did some questionable things, they never explained anything that could have traumatized her to make her do such weird things (her being so obsessed with sex and ""love""). The only reason I could find was her having a form of detachment disorder because of her dad, and now being obsessed with having someone fill in the gap that her dad left out (but I really don\'t know). Also following the other main Yuzu, you never got to know too much about her as a person either. Just about her problems with her sexuality, which can be good in someways but not if you want to do a series. I think in my opinion a series can\'t build up on one certain emotion (movies are better for such things).The anime was also all about Yuzu and Mei which kinda is understandable since they\'re the mains, but I found it really sad since the other characters only existed for the sake of Yuzu\'s and Mei\'s relationship to develop. Like Yuzu\'s friend Harumi. I felt bad for her throughout the whole series and thought it was bad that they mistreated her all the time since she was so nice and Yuzu always seemed to complain about her feelings for Mei. It almost seemed like Yuzu\'s and Sara\'s friendship grew closer than Yuzu\'s and Harumi\'s which also felt bad since Yuzu only had known Sara for a few hours before they started to call each other ""best friends"" etc. This leads to my opinions circling Sara. In my opinion, she was the best character out there. Even though you didn\'t get to know a lot about her she always seemed so humble and nice all the time. You kind of misunderstand her though since stuff towards the end happens (SPOILERS: between her and Mei).You always seemed to misunderstand the characters who interrupting Yuzu\'s and Mei\'s ""thing"" going on. Like how the presented Matsuri and Himeko felt really bad too. All they wanted was love but ended up being painted as creeps or really bad human beings. (Which you end up finding out in the end is false).Although, I\'d still say that I liked the ending (even though it seemed very rushed). As you watched it, it was really hard keeping track of the time since Sara (SPOILER) ended up expressing that she knew a lot about Mei after only dating her for what seemed for the viewers as (a day?).So the things I did like a lot was probably the animation, the way of relating to Yuzu (if you\'ve ever been a questioning gay girl hehe) and the ending. Hands down talking about the animation, I think it was really beautiful and also the main reason to why I continued to watch the whole thing.I also I would\'ve liked the anime better if the series was longer and gave us some more insight in the characters and more variation in the plot, or a movie that in some way both focused on the relationship but varied too. I really don\'t think I would recommend it if you really don\'t like that fanfic kind of vibe, cause that really was the vibe I was given while watching it. Also if you like the yuri theme or a pretty animated anime, I\'d also recommend it. it was a little bit confusing how they decided to portray love with the scenes they included.It was almost like they mixed up love with assault?

Don\'t get me wrong, I like when you show love through action and all that stuff, but throughout this anime it was almost like there only was action and no sincere words from the main characters towards each other that usually makes the watchers hearts melt in another way.Also, I don\'t think you ever had a chance to get to know Mei enough. Even in the end of it, I still didn\'t get why Mei did certain stuff at certain points. Like for example at the end when she did some questionable things, they never explained anything that could have traumatized her to make her do such weird things (her being so obsessed with sex and ""love""). The only reason I could find was her having a form of detachment disorder because of her dad, and now being obsessed with having someone fill in the gap that her dad left out (but I really don\'t know). Also following the other main Yuzu, you never got to know too much about her as a person either. Just about her problems with her sexuality, which can be good in someways but not if you want to do a series. I think in my opinion a series can\'t build up on one certain emotion (movies are better for such things).The anime was also all about Yuzu and Mei which kinda is understandable since they\'re the mains, but I found it really sad since the other characters only existed for the sake of Yuzu\'s and Mei\'s relationship to develop. Like Yuzu\'s friend Harumi. I felt bad for her throughout the whole series and thought it was bad that they mistreated her all the time since she was so nice and Yuzu always seemed to complain about her feelings for Mei. It almost seemed like Yuzu\'s and Sara\'s friendship grew closer than Yuzu\'s and Harumi\'s which also felt bad since Yuzu only had known Sara for a few hours before they started to call each other ""best friends"" etc. This leads to my opinions circling Sara. In my opinion, she was the best character out there. Even though you didn\'t get to know a lot about her she always seemed so humble and nice all the time. You kind of misunderstand her though since stuff towards the end happens (SPOILERS: between her and Mei).You always seemed to misunderstand the characters who interrupting Yuzu\'s and Mei\'s ""thing"" going on. Like how the presented Matsuri and Himeko felt really bad too. All they wanted was love but ended up being painted as creeps or really bad human beings. (Which you end up finding out in the end is false).Although, I\'d still say that I liked the ending (even though it seemed very rushed). As you watched it, it was really hard keeping track of the time since Sara (SPOILER) ended up expressing that she knew a lot about Mei after only dating her for what seemed for the viewers as (a day?).So the things I did like a lot was probably the animation, the way of relating to Yuzu (if you\'ve ever been a questioning gay girl hehe) and the ending. Hands down talking about the animation, I think it was really beautiful and also the main reason to why I continued to watch the whole thing.I also I would\'ve liked the anime better if the series was longer and gave us some more insight in the characters and more variation in the plot, or a movie that in some way both focused on the relationship but varied too. I really don\'t think I would recommend it if you really don\'t like that fanfic kind of vibe, cause that really was the vibe I was given while watching it. Also if you like the yuri theme or a pretty animated anime, I\'d also recommend it.', ""To be honest, I have a kind of love / hate here, because when I saw the series for the first time, I loved it, but after watching it carefully several more times, I realized that it was not what it seemed to me before, for example one of the things that I realized that made me doubt the series was going and putting characters that literally did NOT add ANYTHING to the plot, it's like it had become a typical harem but without grace, especially in the In the end it was what shocked me the most, even when I saw her for the...first time, as for the couple, I felt that I lacked more development, I did not feel that they were fully understood to start a relationship, and the main problem here is Mei, I mean I think they should have made a special chapter where she goes to the psychologist because she has serious problems that are nowhere to be fixed and we must pretend that everything is fine from one day to the next.

Or at least in the top 5 worst things I have ever watched. If after 6 episodes into a 12-episode anime you find that you hate every single character in the show, my advice is to quit watching it.Here's the setup:Yuzu's mom marries a guy that Yuzu has never met and who is travelling in some other part of the world. How they met and got married is never explained. Why Yuzu wasn't at their wedding isn't explained. But apparently Yuzu accepts all of this as if it's normal. It is not....Yuzu is taken out of her school and moved to another city to a new apartment and sent off to what turns out to be a quasi-fascist all-girls academy with strict dress codes and all kinds of stupid rules. Something Yuzu's mom never bothered to prepare Yuzu for, before sending her off in the morning in her regular clothes instead of the school uniform that everyone else is wearing. But apparently Yuzu accepts all of this as if it's normal. It is not.At this new school, Yuzu is confronted by the Fascist student council and their Fascist leader Mei. Later, after Yuzu comes home, Mei suddenly turns up at the apartment and Yuzu's mom tells her that, oh by the way this is her new stepsis. The only one surprised by this is Yuzu, who again was not told about any of this by her mom who, I guess, must be functionally braindead. I don't know. None of it makes any sense whatsoever. Safe to say, Yuzu's mom must be the most clueless person on the planet.Anyways, Yuzu's new stepsis, Mei, is a passive-aggressive dysfunctional mess with zero sense of humor, personality or charm. Yet the writers of this show desperately wants you to like her and feel sorry for her, even while she's treating Yuzu as her doormat and then, for reasons unexplained, sexually assaults her and turns her into a lesbian.We all know that's how gay stuff works.For even more reasons unexplained, Yuzu then falls in love with this narcissistic basket case, and the show really wants very much for you to get invested in the drama that ensues, pretty please! However, this is very hard when you simultaneously loathe the romantic interest of our protagonist, and come to loathe the protagonist as well, for being completely without backbone as she's pathetically chasing after the affections of this emotionally stunted malcontent who has done nothing but behave like an abusive sociopath towards her so far.But Yuzu is in love with Mei because she keeps telling us that she is. We do not know why. I'm not sure anyone knows why. There's nothing in the way Mei behaves that would make anyone fall in love with her. But Yuzu does because the writers want her to. We will just have to accept it, because why bother with reasons or progress?And that's just the first 6 episodes recapped. The whole thing is a grotesque mess that makes no sense, does not reflect how actual humans act or react, feel or behave in any shape or form whatsoever.I have not read the manga and surely not going to after watching this atrocious garbage. I can only assume that whoever wrote it never actually interacted with a real human being, never met a gay person and never experienced love. Because the characters in Citrus are about as two-dimensional as cardboard cutouts and even less interesting. It's like watching a hikikomori making his anime figurines kiss each other.

Characters development did not occur in great scale because it has only 12 episodes . The main focus is on emotions and relationship between people. It has a lots of mature scenes (at least 15+) which can relate to more mature audience. I dont think everyone can get this anime. Message is based on current problems in society.Although plot is not  creative, message behind is solid.Animation is on point, so is art. Sound was good.The real question is, why did i rate it 6/10, it is because...it has ALOT of unnecessary scenes at least for me.In the end i was very very disturbed by the realism, i could not sleep 2 hours constantly thinking about anime. it has ALOT of unnecessary scenes at least for me.In the end i was very very disturbed by the realism, i could not sleep 2 hours constantly thinking about anime.', ""It was okay half of the people who watched this didn't like it and the other half wishes there will be a season 2. I honestly enjoyed the manga way better. The anime was entertaining I think that even if you hated the anime you probably still felt like you needed to finish it because every moment something is going on and it is really quite exciting to watch! It was cool to see some of the moments animated! But overall the animation felt pretty cheap and dry, unlike the manga. The anime ended right when stuff was getting good too so that sorta sucked....But overall entertaining to watch but not really outstanding in anything else had a very solid storyline but it was something for sure. But overall entertaining to watch but not really outstanding in anything else had a very solid storyline but it was something for sure."", 'Spoilers below.You have been warned.There was many things about this series, that before it aired were hyped up so much, yet here we are at the end of it all with a terrible showing of a series. I am honestly disappointed in the series, which initially was looking to be fairly decent. I\'ll split this into segments to better explain why Citrus became such a disappointment for me.Let\'s start off with the story itself which I will rate a 1/10.So this series started off with what appeared to be a well handled story and plot, but got derailed and crashed near the midway point of...the series. From my initial take of the series\' first 4 episodes it was on the right track. The introduction of Mei\'s father and suddenly disappearing after 1 episode was a little like ""What\'s the point?"" Also during this time and throughout the rest of the series Mei somehow transformed into cardboard, but I\'ll get to that later. When we were introduced to Matsuri, in my opinion is when the series started getting terrible. Appeared to be just a forced character to fuel more Yuri bait and get some feathers ruffled. Her inclusion in the series honestly was not needed, it felt out of place and down right intrusive. I\'ll get into details with this character later though. As we continued on to the final episodes even more forced characters just appeared out of the wood work. The ""twins"" (Character designers this is not how twins are...) made the last 3 episodes of Citrus so bad. The lines they delivered really got under my skin. It\'s as if we were expected to believe that people dating for 1 night can suddenly know everything about them! Right. Well the twins didn\'t help much in story advancement to begin with and never really helped during the time they were on screen. The last half of episode 12 should have been tacked onto episode 4 and delete the rest, there half way decent story.I also want to talk about the down right disgusting ecchi aspect of this series. Honestly the ecchi appeared to become the main aspect of the series around episode 4. It\'s as if at a meeting ""How often can we make these girls make out? And get into lewd situations and positions with each!"" As a guy I can say I enjoy ecchi, as long as it\'s not becoming the sole reason for being used in the series. Citrus cannot say that. Most of this series suddenly seemed like ecchi was used to move the story along. Sorry I am not here to watch a Hentai. Thanks.Let\'s get onto the Characters of this series. I gave this a 2/10.I\'ll start with the good and decent characters (with a fair amount of screen time sorry mama and papa Aihara.)  So Yuzu and Harumi are in my eyes one of the small few things of the series that actually aren\'t piss poor bad. Both girls at least had a design that didn\'t appear to be a copy paste from a learn to draw book. Plus they had personality, beyond that of just your normal Mary Sue. Now in spite of still being half decent they have flaws too. Sadly for Harumi her flaw was the lack of screen time, not your fault girl, what ya going to do. Yuzu to me seemed to be on a string and just pulled along from one event to the other, she didn\'t have an initiative to do anything on her own, someone always had to push her or pull her towards the next event. All of the flaws aside, Yuzu and Harumi at least had a bit of brightness.Now terrible characters, there is always one... Too bad we have multiples. I\'ll start with Cardboard Lady. Cough. Mei. Her character design is simple, which is not bad. That sadly is her best quality. Her personality is as bad as wet cardboard. Much as Yuzu seemed to be dragged by a string from event to event, Mei was very much the same. But too bad for Mei is she had nothing else going for her in terms of character development. Her emotions and actions only seemed to mirror the other characters she was on screen with. She wasn\'t her own character, she was everyone else\'s side kick. Another character I\'ll talk about that shared the same, only her design was good, would be Matsuri. Her character design was unique and actually stood out. Sadly her personality was more than just annoying, it was brain shattering annoying. She\'s the screaming 8 year old that couldn\'t get his toy at the mall. Her character was forgetful, I had to look up her name to remember it when writing this.Now let\'s get to the last 2 characters I will talk about. The wonder twins. How in the world are identical twins so different in height? Like a few cm(inches) I\'d be okay to turn a blind eye. But we\'re talking almost 2 feet. What? The inclusion of these girls just seemed so forced and out of place. Like really, the last 3 episodes. Really? And to mention they are supposed to play such a large role in the plot. But having 3 days in the series, and 3 or 4(I forgot) episodes, you just can\'t expect me to buy that. These twins wouldn\'t have been so bad if they were designed more similar in size and actually had more time to be characters in the series. Not just tossed in at the end as fan service.But here we arrive to the Sound and Art department. Hurray we are almost done. I gave both the sounds and animation a 6.At times the series seemed to be lazy in both animation and sounds delivered to the viewers. But other times they were appealing. The opening theme was nice at least.Lastly my enjoyment and closing thoughts.So I overall gave this series a 2. The flaws were just to drastic to even consider this anything better than dreadful. The phrase ""sex sells"" applies to this series so well. The ecchi scenes just seemed to take on more of an important roll than the actual story line did. Such a hyped series leading up to it\'s release only to disappoint so bad. the series. From my initial take of the series\' first 4 episodes it was on the right track.

Moving on...This show is absolutely gorgeous in a niche way. It celebrates Gyaru and high fashion. Everything has an over the top, warm sheen to it. I don’t know how else to describe it. Think Roppongi or Otemachi. It’s not even Harajuku, it’s classier than that. The art work reminds me of Peach Girl in that the characters all have style and everything is detailed in a way that must have been expensive to produce because there isn’t a “set”...way for characters to look; they’re different every episode.I’m not impressed with the storyline. From time to time you get a reason to keep watching. I was about to give up by the episode in which Yuzu invites Mei to visit her father, but it was such a great outcome. Which Yuzu predictably ruins by turning it into an excuse to go on a date with Mei. She is obsessed with Mei to the point that there is no other character development for her. She talks about how much she loves Mei, and everyone around her makes comments about the kind of person she is (caring/loving/selfless/great sister, etc.). It’s a cheap way to get out of actual character development. “If I tell you the character is like this, then we don’t actually have to do the thing.” It almost reminds me of the travesty that is Amnesia, where minor characters point something out that the viewers are never really exposed to. Most conversations in this anime involve Yuzu blushing hysterically, gushing about her feelings (or not feelings) for Mei, then Mei glaring/staring blankly/crying. Then the two trade very short lived ecchi moments before moving on to hurt each other again. It’s a headache.Nothing special about the sound. Yuzu sounds annoyed and frustrated every time she opens her mouth. I think the show could have been drastically improved by edgy, cool music in the same tone as the art. But it wasn’t.Nothing special here at all, unfortunately.

It was extremely well-written, the characters were well-thought out and it was thoroughly enjoyable.  Then came episode 7.  Oh, dear.Why do so many Japanese writers suffer from an uncontrollable urge to add an annoying nuisance character half way through and ruin all their hard work?  We've seen it so many times.  Well, Citrus does this in some considerable style.  The last six episodes were about as enjoyable as sandpapering your buttocks.  A younger character with...a vile personality joins the show in episode seven and serves no purpose other than to get in the way.  She's so irritating, I lost all interest in the show and getting to the end was a struggle.   After such an excellent start, my rating dropped from a ten to a six.  Ten for the first half of the anime, two for the second half; averaging out at six.Would I recommend this show to anyone?  Put it this way, I'd recommend watching the first six episodes; after which, you might as well bin it. a vile personality joins the show in episode seven and serves no purpose other than to get in the way.

Put it this way, I'd recommend watching the first six episodes; after which, you might as well bin it."", 'In my search for more school-romance anime, I stumbled upon Citrus, and oh boy, do we have a doozy.Story: Citrus\' setup is that we have our protagonist, Yuzu, transferring to an all-girls school after her mom remarried.  She dreams of what life will be at this new school, including getting a boyfriend.  Things get off to a rocky start for Yuzu, as she cannot be her carefree self because her new school has rules that she has to abide by.  Her troubles reaches the ears of the student president, Mei, who harshly scolds her early on.  We learn shortly after that...the man that Yuzu\'s mom remarried is actually Mei\'s birth-father.  As a result, Mei and Yuzu will need to live together.  As Mei and Yuzu go about their school and brand new home life, they slowly begin to be romantically attracted to each other.This kind of thing obviously comes with some controversy, but one thing that makes this slightly less controversial is that neither of them share a same birth parent.  That being said, I understand why people don\'t like it.  It\'s unusual, for sure, especially with some what we see happen with Mei in the first few episodes.  But it\'s got both dramatic and touching moments, sometimes, both at the same time.  I really enjoyed the story, even though it had parts that were strange.  Our two characters need to learn to both live together, but also cover up each other\'s insecurities.  It makes for a fascinating tale.Through the course of the series, we learn a great deal about Mei and her past, are likely the most interesting moments.  Behind the façade of being perfect, Mei does have vulnerabilities and we realize that Yuzu is really good at finding what they are - not so she can necessarily exploit them, but so she can help Mei along.  The interactions between the two girls are definitely what you\'ll be watching this for, and I honestly do hope they decide to later continue the story, even if there is harsh backlash on the other side. (9/10)Characters: I actually really like Yuzu and Mei.  They have very defined personalities and it remains consistent throughout the series.  Yuzu\'s obviously very outgoing and isn\'t afraid of ""anything"".  Her ""go and get them"" attitude is literally what drives the entire series and, for better or worse, keeps us watching.  She\'s really caring, even when not given the benefit of the doubt.  It\'s what makes her a solid protagonist.  That personality does tapper off a bit in the back half of the series when she gets more serious, but it never spoils the character.  Mei, on the other hand, holds back a lot, even considering her somewhat withheld personality.  It\'s the quiet ones you need to be careful of because there\'s always something to hide, and we find those.  The dynamics between these two create fantastic moments.There are some good side characters in Harumi and Himeko, but many of the other side characters are forgettable or are really only there to move the plot forward to a fairly small degree.  The arc with Sara near the end does have a fantastic ending, but Nina really made me not want to watch it.  Having a strong story with subpar side characters \'can\' create a good anime, and because Yuzu or Mei are in most every shot, Citrus succeeds here. (7/10)Art: The art direction is mostly nice or above so in today\'s standards.  Unlike most other ""busier"" anime, this one didn\'t really require high end graphics, but they do a nice job here.  Seeing so many shots of the girl\'s school and apartment got old pretty quick so you might\'ve liked different transitions, but not much else to complain about here.  (7/10)Sound: A lot of the OST was fine here.  Nothing really wow\'ed me away and the OP and ED were also fine.  This easily could have been an anime where they used some sillier sounds, but I\'m glad they held off on the urge.  Megan Shipman (Yuzu) continues to impress me with the wide variety of emotions that Yuzu projects.  Amber Lee Connors (Mei) does a good job with Mei, though she wasn\'t required to project more dramatically nearly as much.  Most of the rest of the cast are smaller names - though Felecia Angelle (Sara) does get points from me for her performance.  Overall, solid sound without ever being exceptional.  (7/10)Overall enjoyment: Despite the controversial topic, Citrus is honestly a decent anime.  I\'ve attempted to find some other school-romance (some shoujo-ai, some not) and you could do much worse than Citrus.  The story obviously carries this and it\'s not like we haven\'t seen controversy in anime before.  Some of the side characters do hold it back a little, but anything focusing on Yuzu and Mei is well worth paying attention to.  I have a hard time saying whether it\'s better than your average romance anime because I simply haven\'t seen many, but I did enjoy watching this one and would return should a sequel air.

(7/10)', 'Citrus was an anime that I heard about before it was released, as being ""that yuri anime"". I don\'t watch much anime so I completely forgot about it until recently when I watched my friends play some anime music quiz game and the opener for this anime came on and a discussion followed.I did watch this anime in 2 sessions, but thankfully the first half of the anime feels pretty separate from the second half. I don\'t know what much I expected out of this besides ""haha yuri scenes lewd"" and yes, this anime does have several kissing scenes, and several scenes that almost...imply going further, before the action stops due to one of the characters.On the whole, I didn\'t feel that much emotional impact or investment into the characters. The dialogue at times I thought was poorly written, or confusing. I would have to rewind some scenes several times because I couldn\'t make sense of what the dialogue meant that the character was thinking. I could read the words and understand what they meant, but I had no idea why the character said them and how it impacted their next action. There were times when I thought that the dialogue was cringey, which you could argue is fine because the characters are in high school, but I felt that the dialogue was a different kind of cringe.The story goes from ""yuri"" into ""daddy issues"" and then all of a sudden into ""2 episode \'villain\' arcs"" that I feel nothing really gets developed until the end. All the character development from the first half isn\'t really mentioned much in the second half. Most of the investment I had for Mei\'s character in the 2nd half felt like it happened in the last episode. I can\'t recall much of the first half right now, but in the second half Mei doesn\'t really do much. She is the cause of all the action, but it\'s always what happens to her. At the same time, Mei and Yuzu both felt like they were flip-flopping around every episode. Sure you can argue that it\'s because they\'re confused about their feelings, but after awhile it started to annoy me.There were also several scenes with ""non-consensual"" undertones that were hard to watch. I\'m not sure what else to say about those.The art seemed ok to me, there were only a few scenes where I felt that the quality degraded. At the same time, there were no visuals that really stood out to me. The music became kinda trite near the end, as there\'s one motif for when romantic action is occurring and then another for when drama is occurring, and that\'s basically it. It cheapens the impact of scenes later on when I heard the music, because then I just thought, ""oh there it is. The director wants me to feel the drama now"" or something.Overall I thought Citrus was ""meh"" at best and ""bad"" or ""confusing"" at worst. I felt like most of the anime is just jerking me around between a ""will they or won\'t they"" until the last episode. Watch it for the yuri scenes if you want, but there aren\'t that many overall and they are mostly on the tamer side. But in that case, you may as well watch a youtube compilation instead of all 12 episodes. imply going further, before the action stops due to one of the characters.On the whole, I didn\'t feel that much emotional impact or investment into the characters.

Citrus has a horrible plot and one-dimensional characters. It's bad. Like really bad. But it's pleasant to the eyes and entertaining.I've never seen an anime go from one scene to another this quickly. It seems the whole purpose of each passing scene is to just get to the next sexual scene as quickly as possible, while still maintaining a semblance of story telling. Mei is an extremely annoying character who's 100% unlikable. Yuzu is dumb as it gets. Most characters really are pathetic. One exception is Matsuri, unfortunately she's quickly set aside in...favor of two sisters who don't bring anything to the story.The art and animation are at times great, but devolve into an inconsistent pile of crap as the anime advances. The animation and camera spans in ep 12 are hideous, but they make the episode very funny to watch. Music is good I suppose, I didn't care much for it.Of all the ways Citrus could have been good, the way in which it was produced is far from it. It's a deception, a shame, and it should serve as a good example of what NOT to do. People should openly shame Citrus as degeneracy that shall not be encouraged. Melodramatic stories are engaging and addictive, sure, but an anime of such low objective quality shouldn't exist.That being said, I've enjoyed it. I laughed my ass off at how crappy and inconsistent everything was. The Yuri scenes were good, if not cringy. Matsuri was a real breath of dramatic fresh air, as she had me hope that things would take a tragic twist.Citrus is a lot more bad than good, but one can't dispute it does have some twisted qualities.

The storyline as a whole isn't bad, the characters remain interesting, and the artwork is also good. However, many parts of this anime are very uncomfortable honestly. The story is of two step-sisters falling in love, and there are many scenes where consent is completely disregarded. A lot of the beginning interactions with the two sisters are sexual assault, on top of the fact it romanticizes incest. I think had it been a story between two girls that were not sisters...and the actions were consensual, it would have been great. and the actions were consensual, it would have been great."", 'citrus was definitely an experience. i decided to watch it because i’m a fan of yuri and literally everyone’s first recommendation is citrus when it comes to it. i’ve heard many mixed reviews about it, and i didn’t understand the negativity until i watched it myself. yikes. honestly, i don’t have much good to say about this. yuzu was a great character, and i honestly found myself feeling bad for her. her and mei’s relationship was exhausting to watch, a constant battle of tug and pull. they ended up pretty much back where they had originally started by the end, and it was really frustrating....not even the opening excited me much, which was pretty much how i knew what kind of an experience i was going to have.if you’re looking for an anime with good yuri relationships, i probably wouldn’t watch this one. yeah, it’s got pretty funny moments, but it’s nothing remarkable. the art is pretty, and some of the characters are genuinely interesting. that’s about all i can say about it. not even the opening excited me much, which was pretty much how i knew what kind of an experience i was going to have.if you’re looking for an anime with good yuri relationships, i probably wouldn’t watch this one. yeah, it’s got pretty funny moments, but it’s nothing remarkable. the art is pretty, and some of the characters are genuinely interesting. that’s about all i can say about it.', 'I don\'t know how to write a review so...Well as a person who read the manga before watching the anime this was a misunderstanding..That\'s actually sad because if the author explained the fact that they are not sister at the begining this would be the best Yuri in my list or even for everyone.I repeat again that they\'re not sister at all before somebody gets upset by reading that..Characters -Yuzu is like a sunshine but ehhh don\'t take your relationship with your sister as incest please. She actually accept the fact that she\'s probably doing incest shit...Mei is intelligent but so boring and never know...what to do.

As I was watching Kuzu no Honkai (that I didn’t really like...that time but this is good shit I wanna cry god) I was asking me that a more chiller anime will be okay and that time I decided to just let go off all my stupid ideas on homosexuality for the first time and just like a good anime with two girls.And god citrus changed me forever.Citrus is a beautiful history, with sometimes good ideas of plans but like it’s not very well animated, like a lot of romcom these times, just not too less so it’s looking good but no more. But the history is one of the first that hit me in the heart so hard. A tragic and humoristic story about how a girl who has lost everything and gain then a family, and a girl that is just lost in her false idea of sexuality and who is hiding behind a heterosexuality that is not her. And a chara development (which is better in the manga huh) but which touch us where it should: every episodes in the Matsuri’s arc was a pain to me because I just hated this little bad girl who try to break my best ship of all time, and just like when she actually knew that what she was doing is like reaallllly bad, every characters helped her. It’s beautiful as fuck.Musics are beautiful, like just go listen to the opening, Azalea, best song of nano.ripe in my opinion, there is also the best OST of all time (nope) Pity in her eyes, which is like damn fucking hard to listen to me bc I wanna cry everytime.Moreover all I can say, I think that Citrus is an experience, maybe not the one that will hurt you but it’s a beautiful introspection about how people can grow and gain maturity without having to be someone they aren’t.So just go watch Citrus, just try it, but you can’t just say that u didn’t even try the first episode, it’s too cruel for an anime of that quality in his writing. that time but this is good shit I wanna cry god) I was asking me that a more chiller anime will be okay and that time I decided to just let go off all my stupid ideas on homosexuality for the first time and just like a good anime with two girls.And god citrus changed me forever.Citrus is a beautiful history, with sometimes good ideas of plans but like it’s not very well animated, like a lot of romcom these times, just not too less so it’s looking good but no more.

There are a lot of moments where Mei and (especially) Yuzu were really unsure about how to convey their feelings to each other. So much so that even Matsuri had to give advice on how Yuzu can make her...moves with Mei and how to really approach her (Mei).But then again, Yuzu really hasn't experienced love so I guess I can kind of understand where she is coming from with having to have a crush on a person that is also a girl. moves with Mei and how to really approach her (Mei).But then again, Yuzu really hasn't experienced love so I guess I can kind of understand where she is coming from with having to have a crush on a person that is also a girl."", 'mixed feelings….story line good, characters are cool but why are they sisters….. like THEY SIMPLY COULD IF MADE THEM ROOMMATES?? or like IDK? and also i dont think its very ethical to assult your sister like that 🤨🤨🤨 not very fantastic. its a shame tho cause the art style when they kiss is amazing, its very detailed but… they are sisters 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨 eeerrmmmmm brahlowkey a bummer as i said cause the characters are really cool and different, like the main character yuzu shes very different to most characters i see in wlw that ive watched at least. it was a very cool character. same with...mei, a tough character hard to get into yk that was also cool. but once again all of this lovely stuff gets shattered by the fact that they literally sexually assault one another although they are litwally sisters 🤓🤓🤓 mei, a tough character hard to get into yk that was also cool. but once again all of this lovely stuff gets shattered by the fact that they literally sexually assault one another although they are litwally sisters 🤓🤓🤓', ""I bought Citrus out of curiosity from the trailer, and it was a short series.I'm fairly new to anime and manga (in my late 50s) and have been struck by the social nuances of superior entries such as 'A Silent Voice', 'your name', 'Komi Can't Communicate' and 'The Gods Lie' etc. I thought the trailer presented an interesting relationship and wondered how it would be resolved.It does seem that the anime series is a much truncated version of the 10 Volume manga, and I feel - even if only having the first manga Volume - that whole chunks of the narrative and character backstories have...either been drastically abridged or just left out. Yes, some back stories ARE there, but my feeling at the end was that something BIG was missing.There also seemed to be a rather fixed focus on ALL of the potential relationships being yuri. Yes it is largely set in an all-girls school (I happen to work at one in the UK, and this was something else that drew me to the series). Is Mei *really* that attractive as a person, not just in looks? She does appear to have a kinder side (note Sara, or is that another one-sided attraction?) but her perpetually 'sad/lonely' scowl and cold aloof attitude make her the most unappealing of characters, regardless of how she came to be like that. The only men to feature are Mei's fiance, Mei's father, and Mei/Yuzu's stern grandfather - al of whom are written out all too quickly when they could have provided some balance to views.The series, as usual, is beautifully designed and animated but the characters and overall narrative are somewhat flawed, and it ends where it perhaps could have begun. There's a feeling of having to wrap up the loose ends (through the closing titles of episode 12!?) because either it was cancelled, or no more of the manga could be adapted?

I say trashy, but it's like a classy kind of trash. Trash that's been spit-shined and polished to be nearly presentable. The kind of trash you might even put out on display on your mantel to show the world. I think I'm losing the metaphor, the point is that I'd have to be awfully cynical to dismiss this show as having nothing of value in it.I think it's funny how in yuri works like this it's rarely even a consideration...that they're both girls once they've decided they like each other. What I mean is that the supposed taboo here is not so much the fact that it's a girl on girl relationship, but the fact that they're step-siblings. I mean I guess either would be pretty spicy on its own, but I just felt more emphasis was given to the whole incest angle being bad. Is it really that much of a foregone conclusion as all girl high schools that some of those girls are going to hook up with each other? I don't know.I guess I don't really have any deep analysis or profound insights to give. I found myself not all that interested in the plot around the time I watched this. I'll admit the only reason I watched it in the first place is because of the yuri and my head space at the time was just wanting to watch some girls kissing girls. It delivers on that aspect at least, but when your in it for just that the drama feels like its just getting in the way and pointlessly drawing out the run time. So I was bored, mostly. Perhaps I'll give the series another go some time in the future but I really have no desire to at the moment. I give it a 6/10 that they're both girls once they've decided they like each other.

It's one of those series where you will personally have to like it for it to make an impact on you. If not, then it can be hit or miss.I have not read the manga for this one, so the rating is solely off of watching this series. It is really well crafted, honestly. The animation, characters, score, it's all really great. It is a bit slow and it is on the soft and romantic side but it is a good watch.There were one or two parts that crossed over into odd (fetish-esque) territory, but it was always...pulled back into a normal and sweet version of reality.

My second piece of texual evidence was from the christmas when Mei tried to s8x with YuzuBitch but to my displeasement they did not have fuck so Im not...sure if they are lesbians at this point.Counter Claim: Some may argue that they are in fact lesbians but according to my calculations it does not seem this way because they did not have fuk.Overall: I will have to write this anime a 2/10 because i am clueless as to whewther they are gay or what.Highly Recommand.Reviewer’s Rating: 1PS Kaachon wrote that with the last 2 remaining brain cells they had before gaining another chromosome ;p sure if they are lesbians at this point.Counter Claim: Some may argue that they are in fact lesbians but according to my calculations it does not seem this way because they did not have fuk.Overall: I will have to write this anime a 2/10 because i am clueless as to whewther they are gay or what.Highly Recommand.Reviewer’s Rating: 1PS Kaachon wrote that with the last 2 remaining brain cells they had before gaining another chromosome ;p', 'Citrus is an absolute garbage fire of a cartoon.That being said, I did enjoy it in spite of that. It was at least good enough to make me elicit emotions beyond cringe.Despite what most people think, I honestly don’t really consider this an overly smutty or horny anime. Mostly because there actually isn’t much fan service. Honestly the whole show seems more like some melodramatic daytime soap opera than anything. It isn’t really a “fluffy” or “wholesome” yuri the same way some of the other ones I’ve watched are, but it’s fine I guess.The protagonist Yuzu is a decent one, but sadly the love-interest/Deuteragonist Mei...is a bit..... flat (not a boob joke I swear). Mei’s basically the stereotypical ice queen character who expresses very little and doesn’t open up about her feelings, combined with that Yuri trope where the deuteragonistic love interest is a dark-haired girl with excessive emotional baggage from their past. Some of the other characters though, are kind of gonna get a “yikes” from me. Namely the MIDDLE SCHOOLER. like seriously, there’s a middle schooler character who’s a dead ringer for Miku from 5toubun (seriously, similar hairstyle and eye color, hair color similar too, wears headphones) who is one of the antagonists and she is just.... YIKES. She does some really questionable stuff. There’s also a girl with twin tails and they give her big eyebrows so the audience can tell she’s not supposed to be likable.The story is rather overt in just how dramatic and depressing it wants to be. Like there’s just a ton of conflict, and it can be a bit much.One issue I do have is how the show, despite being a depressing drama about stepsisters, constantly uses those typical anime sparkles/chibi/moe expressions like super deformed. It’s funny, but it doesn’t gel with the down-to-earth feel of the rest of the show, and can be a bit of a mood whiplash. Ffs, there’s literally one character who exists solely for a gag with Yuzu being late who has a giant hairstyle like a mushroom, and she only appears once at the beginning and one more time near the end.Ultimately I’d say citrus is.... fine I guess. Just not something everyone can enjoy. And there’s a lot of moments that are just... Absolutely yikes. is a bit..... flat (not a boob joke I swear).

Entretanto, Yuzu e Mei não são irmãs de sangue e não foram criadas juntas, então não é incesto.Há também muitas críticas sobre os comentários que a própria Yuzu faz durante a série, se perguntando como uma irmã deveria se portar e imediatamente depois flertando ou mesmo PEGANDO a Mei. Mas, honestamente, acredito que era só a forma que a Yuzu, enquanto aluna de ensino médio e completamente inocente e inexperiente no amor, estava usando para tentar encontrar respostas para seus sentimentos e ideias de abordagem.Além do mais,...Yuzu é filha única, então ela nem sabe o que é ser criada com irmãos desde pequena: a única pessoa que se assemelha a essa relação é a Matsuri, e a Yuzu claramente não sente e nem consegue sentir nada pela Matsuri. De forma geral, acredito que dá pra dizer que a Yuzu só esbarrou num nicho muito problemático e polêmico enquanto explorava seus próprios sentimentos.A Mei é uma cabeça-dura, teimosa e irritante, mas com o tempo dá para se apaixonar por ela também, tanto quanto dá para se apaixonar pela Yuzu. Dá pra ver que, no começo, ela estava só brincando com a Yuzu, provavelmente por já estar noiva e querer aproveitar o tempo que ainda tinha. Após Yuzu ajudá-la com seu pai, Mei desenvolveu sentimentos de forma tão repentina que nem soube o que fazer com eles e seguiu tentando abordagens inadequadas (e até desrespeitosas) com a Yuzu. A dinâmica é muito doida, mas interessante e cativante. Fell first x fell harder.Muito doido que essa situationship tinha tudo pra dar errado. Yuzu carregou esse relacionamento nas costas e merece fisioterapia para qualquer dor na coluna depois disso.Recomendo ler o mangá para continuar de onde o anime parou.Nota 10 porque amo muito essas duas, muito mesmo.

The first page review by Altoroark or whatever his name is gives a really insightful analysis of the show so I would recommend you to read that review after this if you believe you might watch, as it tells the true nature of the show rather than examining it at surface level like most of the idiot reviewers like the most recent one prior to mine.This show is the definition of hit-or-miss. I'm not into yuri but I was getting a lot...of recs for this show so i'll try and break it down without too much analysis because I am 100% sure that this show is highly, highly subjective. Sexual Assault. Grooming. You get all of it in the first 3 episodes. If that offends you, don't watch, you won't like it. This show requires you to look deeper into characters and understand why they act the way they do. While it isn't clear, every character does have a logical reason for why they do things, even if the action itself isn't logical. There are a lot of characters and they keep getting piled on. Love triangles? You get them in abundance. Plot? mc is trying to find love. Characters? Ok here is the meat of the review, this show is primarily about character development and the various connections among the characters. I liked the show because I felt the main character is likeable and i understood where mei (the other mc) came from, watching their development was quite nice for me and well done. Music? I thought it was great, especially in terms of timing, helped out the suspense and drama. Animation? Lowkey trash, but ok if you factor in budget but it still isn't good. Overall? I enjoyed watching it even though it was so unbearably cringe at times. It is important that I mention the entire cast always does braindead overly dramatic things in public and the reactions of the people around them are included in the scenes so if you get secondhand embarassment easily, this might be annoying for you. I had to take my headphones out and wince while watching some scenes. Like I said, this will be highly subjective, I recommend watching not one but two episodes and then decide if you want to continue from there if you find it interesting, the sexual assault doesn't really get worse (yes I know its bad) than the first episode. 7/10 thanks for reading, -nashy of recs for this show so i'll try and break it down without too much analysis because I am 100% sure that this show is highly, highly subjective.

Half of the anime, it\'s bullcrap love triangles that all go like""oH I lOVE _____ i\'m gonna ruin your relationship with ____ so you can be with MEEEEE"".It just wasn\'t interesting, time to look for other Yuri anime.Oh, the art just looked...gross. Their blush and eyes did not need to be so over exaggerated. gross. Their blush and eyes did not need to be so over exaggerated.', 'I\'ll make this short and spoiler-free.I had started watching Citrus a while back (the first few episodes) and having an interest in the story, decided to read the manga and compare both. To my great demise, I am utterly disappointed in the fact that there are only about 16 out of the 50 chapters of the manga that were adapted. I found the manga intriguing, exciting and had quite an emotional time binge-reading all of it. I personally found the pacing adequate and the ending relatively believable and satisfying.I then decided to continue watching the Anime adaptation, and to my surprise, there\'s simply a fat...chunk of the story that\'s been completely left out and wasn\'t adapted. I was looking forward to watching it animated, anticipating what kind of music or atmosphere would be used to depict the scenes I had such a great time imagining and picturing in my mind. Alas, my hopes were unfulfilled and crushed as I watched, episode after episode, telling myself time and time again ""only a couple episodes left, no way they adapted everything.. I hope they did though.."". So, I\'m very disappointed about that, and that\'s what impacted my enjoyment the most. Nonetheless, the adaptation was good in my opinion, the art and characters reflect what I had imagined whilst reading the manga. And the story pretty much follows the chapters in order, but there\'s like 70% of it missing, so yeah. I didn\'t really get emotional whilst watching, even though I did when reading, and I\'m usually the kind of person that gets teary eyes easily when watching romance/drama.The only redeeming qualities of this adaptation are the Art, the animation fluidity and the OP that\'s pretty great, in my opinion. Otherwise, what a waste of an opportunity to adapt a good manga. It needed a 24 episode season at the very least.If you want to know how it (truly) ends, you have to read the manga. Actually, just read the manga, it\'s better that way, you get the full story and the same great art, minus the animation/music/sounds. Anyway, since I doubt there\'s going to be a sequel to this adaptation, I\'m going to cherish the memories I\'ve made within myself when reading the manga and imagining what it\'d actually look like animated. chunk of the story that\'s been completely left out and wasn\'t adapted.

I never wanna touch this anime again. The plot is something out of a porno; in fact, the only good parts of this anime were the sexual interactions the characters partook in and that was even cringe since the development was poorly executed and characters were poorly developed and progressed. The only good episode was episode 5 cuz it was pretty wholesome at the end and ep 6. I only wish Mei's character was more complex and interesting. Shes pretty much a kuudere cookie-mother-fucking-cutter (what a gawd damn shame since we saw from glimpses in previous episodes, like episode 6, that...she was more complex, traumatized, darker, and scummier than upon first examination). Also, the characters are one dimensional and not believable at all due to poor development. There are seemingly shallow and unenjoyable concomitant charters whom does a poor job at advancing the narrative.In short, I cringed so fucking hard so many times I cant even count dawg.Just do not watch. she was more complex, traumatized, darker, and scummier than upon first examination).

This anime has taken the breath out of my body like none other have done before. I\'ve found myself inside of the show many times and I would just love to say, this is more than just a haha lesbian incest. When I first got into Citrus, I was expecting to clown on it fully. Funnily enough I was very impressed with everything. So first let\'s talk about the animation. The style these characters are put in really matches the kind of esque I think they are going for. I think the characters were drawn very smoothly, and...weirdly enough I caught myself looking at people\'s hair a lot just because of the amazing texture. Now onto characters, personally my favorite is Mei. I\'m always a big fan for characters who have stuff hiding. Mei while being incredibly talented and even being the president of the student council president has her flaws. Mei is very clingy and from what I assume will take affection from many. Yuzu has developed a lot throughout the story. As she started off not really liking Mei into completely loving her. (In family and significantly) I think a big theme in their relationship is that ""Opposites Attract."" Now before I get into the semi-side characters I would just like to say I love how Citrus doesn\'t shove characters into our faces non-stop like other anime. Now for the others, I kind of wish Mama and Papa got a little bit more screen-time. As Mom came in whenever she pleased (which isn\'t a lot) and Father came in for one episode, Which is a shame because he seemed like he could be a cool character. Matsuri... Oh Matsuri. Never liked her and never will. She\'s WAAAAAY to obsessive and even blackmailed Mei to take Yuzu for herself. Selfish pink-haired poopy head. Taniguchi is the funny big tittie anime girl, but honestly she\'s more than just that. A comic relief character is exactly what this show needed and we ate good. Momokino, I honestly wish this character got more screen-time. Although she seemed very mean, I think she could have gone somewhere as a character and not a side project. Sara and Nina, They were very obscure but honestly left an impact because Sara was the first to confess to Mei. Now, I had a lot of trouble with what I call the ""Love Pentagon of Citrus."" This contains Yuzu, Mei, Momokino, Matsuri, and Sara. Like listen girls, I know Mei is hot and all but 3 girls on Mei and 1 on Yuzu. It just seems odd how connected these characters are. Now onto scenery, who ever drew these backgrounds. They deserve a reward but god damn reward, I cannot fathom how beautiful some scenes are so you\'ll need to watch it yourself. Now onto a huge part, the story and lore is not to be understated. I\'ll be honest, It started as lesbian incest but somehow evolved into something greater. An obscure bond between two sisters trying to get to know eachother better into a great love saga. I came in with a weird mindset and left with the biggest smile on my face. Now of course this show is good as one thing that scared me. It made me feel, especially in a certain area. I\'m the guy who has practically never gotten hard at anime and well. Citrus changed me in a way I don\'t understand. Also, many blue-ball moments went down but I respect it. If there were to many kiss scenes, people would only watch for that and not the great GREAT story. Out of 10 I give it a 9.9/10, because I had some tiny tiny gruffs.

So it's a 7, because it's good.Let's put things in perspective. This is a slice of life, yuri. Art and music are not the priority, they are more than good enough.The two main characters are still in the spectrum of normal people, in my opinion. This is somehow ignored by many reviews I saw here, but it shouldn't be. They are not the classic tsundere or the super cute kawai girl, they could actually exist.The characters development is there, but it could have been better.I have only one problem with the...story, towards the end some events/encounters are too rushed.

Unfortunately this is common of the genre and of slice of life as a whole.Overall i would suggest it to anyone unless your line of thought is like one of the examples below.- Too many kisses. There's no such thing. If you compare it to the average romance anime where after 7 years together the main accomplishment is holding hands, then yes, too many. If you've ever been adolescent, how many kisses would you expect between two high school teens in some kind of a relationship?

I can assure any of you that avoiding to filter anything you see by your biases (obsessions) makes everything better.- Rape. There's no rape.

This is a very subjective review, so take it with a grain of salt.Also note that I started watching this show off of a whim, and had never heard of it beforehand.I just finished watching it, honestly, it had a good start. The main thing that caught my eye initially was the yuri aspect of the anime. As somebody who watches romcoms often, and hasn\'t ever looked into any sort of yuri, it found it pretty interesting, yet also kind of relatable in some aspects. That\'s why I found myself pretty disappointed in how the story folded out. I would have to...say that the biggest issue I had with the anime were the characters. In the beginning of the anime, I found them to be somewhat relatable (albeit I\'m a straight male). As the story folded out, it got better up until the 7th episode. The story and characters became quite predictable, which was somewhat annoying. It  kind of reminded me of Bunnygirl-Senpai, in how there were multiple (two in this case) story arcs with similar ideas. Here being a sort of love triangle with an outsider interfering, however here it just didn\'t work, it felt repetitive. The characters begin to act in ways that honestly didn\'t even strike me as things normal people would do. One character I hate and love is Matsuri, she had me so angry throughout the time she was in the spotlight, which was enjoyable in retrospect, as the second love triangle was honestly a big boring. At that point I was able to predict about everything pretty easily.  By the end of the series, I wanted to punch every character in the throat, aside from Harumi.To be honest, it\'s one of those show\'s that I\'m really disappointed about, since it started out quite well, and turned out a bit boring.Something else I didn\'t really think about initially while watching was how consent is disregarded many times per episode. There were many moments where I was thinking "" these people don\'t care about boundaries at all"". I was astonished that there wasn\'t a single scene where Matsuri was punched. I think what really pissed me off the most was how many of the character had no problem being intrusive to a sickening point. It was in this point where the characters felt the least relatable.In conclusion, This is basically a yuri version of Domestic Girlfriend, if it was done poorly.

Character depiction is mostly ehhhhh, and disappointingly does not improve upon the tropes. The opaque soundtrack is mostly basic and nothing that will blow you away.

Often these arcs are at least decent in premise, and the first one is actually very good. But the producers didn\'t know what to do in order to flush out these arcs. The result is characters with unexplained actions, rapidly changing stances, and a sense of distance from the audience. It\'s not necessarily boring, but this anime could have been so much better if they focused on one arc.The art and sound are decent, although one of the musical licks sounds like the soundtrack to ""Your Name"" to me....If they actually are ripping off Shinkai, I guess it\'s better to copy good things.All in all, this anime qualifies as a decent time passer, especially if you\'re looking for a yuri show. It\'s not much more than that though.

It\'s not much more than that though.', 'After watching Citrus, I think I can understand why several people think this isn\'t a good anime. However, I personally believe it\'s actually very good, aside a few parts of it.The story sets off and proceeds rather smoothly. Yes, it was a cliche direction, but it was mostly natural-feeling nevertheless - aside from Mei\'s unusual sexual assaults of Yuzu in the beginning, which could very easily be interpreted as fetishized fanservice (which I believe COULD be that, but is really mostly involving Mei\'s oddness instead). The progress of the girls\' relationship after that is nicely paced as well, unlike many other romance anime paces out...there - one of the things I appreciate and love most about Citrus. After a while, though, the story started adding what felt like unnecessary love rival (or what I like to refer to as ""cockblock"") arcs. Not to mention, the entire anime - from beginning to near end - is overall clogged with an unnecessary amount of sexual assaults and kisses (likely the main factor that causes several people to dislike Citrus). Sure, they don\'t happen 24/7, but- They still happen frequently enough to where it can easily grow a bit uncomfortable for those who don\'t find pleasure in watching sexual assaults or incest in anime like most hentai watchers do. There\'s also how the unmorality of stepsister romance wasn\'t brought up enough for some reason - almost as though people in the anime generally thinks it\'s ok while the irl general society actually doesn\'t think so. It WAS brought up a few times, though, so I guess that\'s alright. No hate towards the incest, though- I just like a bit of realism being shown regarding it. Still a 7/10 for the story, though.The art is also actually quite good. Even though it\'s still kinda lacking in expressiveness, Citrus did a bit of a better job in conveying emotions and makeup in the characters\' visages than most other animes do. It\'s surprising to find expressions with visible subtle emotions and makeup, honestly. Like- with slightly sad expressions in Citrus, not much change is made to them. Yet, you can TELL that there\'s some hidden sadness within them. Makeup is actually there without looking weird, too. Thank goodness for that, since it would be weird to go through another anime that claims some characters wear makeup and some don\'t when they both don\'t/do seem to have any on. The main characters do actually look quite pretty as well, and the hair\'s nice to stare at. The art can sometimes be slightly unpleasant to look at, though, simply due to my personal preferences. Overall, 8/10.I also think the sound effects were done quite well, though the music is alright. I mean, the quality of the music is fine, but the music is not that much to my taste. Still a 7/10 for me, though, since I still like it alright.The characters were also what I enjoyed most from this anime. They really make up for the ok plot, and are essentially why the general story was rather good. Yuzu, for one, is a refreshing change from the anime protagonists I\'m used to seeing. She\'s really just a normal, preppy girl who at first wants a boyfriend. That part of her was nicely demonstrated; not too exaggerated and shown nor too pushed away. Even better, Yuzu has a realistic mix of outgoingness, kindness, denseness, insecurities, understandingness, impulsiveness, and impatience. I mean.. aside from how ridiculously dense she was being during Matsuri\'s arc, and how slightly too dense Yuzu was during Sara\'s arc (even though it\'s completely forgivable) anyway. Mei has a nice and complicated personality, too, involving emotions and thoughts swirling within her that speak more than a ""cold, cool"" personality. Mei DOES feel a bit too ""cold/cool"" and unpredictable, though. The other characters are pretty good, too, including Matsuri - whose existence I honestly hated at first until I realized how deep her characterization actually was. It\'s too bad the anime didn\'t show the characterization more clearly, though. 8/10 for characters.Overall, I rather enjoyed this anime. Not by much, but I still enjoyed it. I doubt I would ever re-watch this due to the annoying ""cockblock"" arcs (and how I rarely rewatch any anime series in the first place), but I\'ll still definitely consider going to the manga and manga sequel Citrus+.So would I generally recommend this anime? Sadly no, purely due to the excessive amount of sexual assaults and kisses in it. However, Citrus is still a very good anime to check out if you like yuri with proper development (excluding, well, yeah, even though they\'re not that bad) and characters. The manga might be a better place to go to, though, since its rating is better and might follow the trend of source-being-better-than-anime-adaption. there - one of the things I appreciate and love most about Citrus.

For me, the show also never had one of those super nice romantic moments which is somewhat dissapointing although I can see why.Super Positive- Doesnt have the whole stupid assumption-based 2+ episode drama plot that make you facepalm the whole time since all the drama and...misunderstandings actually make sense and are pretty relatable.Char Design- The character design was spectacular with every character looking vibrant and well designed. Expecially with makeup on anime characters, it can sometimes be way too overdone and distracting making them look ridiculous but they have just enough color to show its there without it seeming way too overdone and clownish.Plot- The story is pretty by the book, although the plot not just devolving at any point is a huge plus since this seems to happen too much in many romance anime I watch.Art/Sound- Arts really good, nothing too special but its more than enough for what they are showing and can make things look very appealing. Same thing with the sound too. misunderstandings actually make sense and are pretty relatable.Char Design- The character design was spectacular with every character looking vibrant and well designed.

It follows the story of two girls who attend an all girls school and it revolves around the feelings they give each other - obviously. It sounds simple yet Citrus is a very misunderstood anime.If you take care you very often see the bigger picture behind some scenes and some dialogues which others just see as ""forced and annoying"". I must admit while watching Citrus the second time I noticed there WERE forced scenes that really weren\'t necessary (for example LOTS OF KISSES).But even if this anime has his ups and down it\'s...overall a great anime. If you like (or have no problem with) Yuri, like ""intense"" scenes but still want to laugh now and then, then you\'ll enjoy this anime. No doubt.If you are very interested in this story then I\'d even recommend the manga because I personally think it visualised some scenes better and the story feels ""slower"". overall a great anime.

All I have to say is: Thank you for Studio Passione for the making the most out of the source materials available.

The relationship between Mei and Yuzu is so good(in a toxic way) and I forever defend the anime adaptation. The pacing is solid with consistent fan service and lovers quarrels to keep viewers engaged. The character cast is fine, albeit underdeveloped (besides Yuzu and Mei). Yuzu is extremely well developed and her mission to understand her and Mei\'s feelings is very genuine an beautiful. Mei is a bit more linear, being the 2nd protagonist, but this is not to say she does not make significant changes over the course of the show. The first ""antagonist"" is meh...but not great and the 2nd one is downright filler and is only their to force a divide in the romance. The show is strongest when its focusing on the romance and not external situations. Many discuss the ethics and morality of Yuzu and Mei\'s relationship, and while I understand the thought, this is a show meant to portray an unrealistic and taboo love. Attempting to morally condemn the show is a misunderstanding of the point. To conclude, this show just does everything for me, and while I understand the hate, I just cannot bring myself to not love this one. Overall: not for everyone, but a favorite of mine. but not great and the 2nd one is downright filler and is only their to force a divide in the romance.

Why, you may ask? I don't know. The series never really explored this. We never discover why the Kampfers are fighting in the first place and this season only reminds us of things we already know.The first episode only barely moves the story forward, while...the second is just a one-off story that sees Natsuru getting a part-time job because her breasts have become too big and she needs bras. *sigh* That's it. That's all the story this season gives us. There is no meaningful narrative progression whatsoever and the heroines are no closer to stopping whatever Sakura has planned than they were at the beginning. Also, why are we even calling them heroines? They are more interested in taking Natsuru's virginity than stopping the bad guys. This story is a complete and absolute disaster. (2/10)CharactersNatsuru continues to be a pathetic and useless moron who just stands around and lets others do all the heavy-lifting for him/her. At no point does he/she ever try to be useful to his/her team. He/she is one of the worst protagonists in anime history, and the other girls are hardly any better.Mikoto and Akane are more interested in hooking up with Natsuru than, say, stopping Sakura. Shizuku is still the finest character in the show. She is the only with the greatest dedication at stopping Sakura, and I admit I find it amusing how easily she can run circles around Natsuru. She's the only character of this show with any semblance of dignity. Unfortunately, one good character is not enough to redeem such a worthless cast. (3/10)ArtMuch like the first series, this season doesn't exactly impress in terms of visual quality. The character designs look mediocre and done with the lowest effort humanly possible and the fight scenes aren't something to write home about, either. The only times the animation holds up is during the fanservice scenes, because the only thing Kampfer is interested in is titillating male viewers. With animation this terrible, it almost looks like the animators wanted this show to fail! (4/10)SoundThe soundtrack isn't bad, but not impressive either. The voice acting, on the other hand, is wonderful! Seriously, the voice actors cannot earn enough praise for rising above the material they're given and do their absolute best, even when their characters are not worthy of their talents. When a character is bad, I normally try to not hold it against the actor voicing them. They are just people doing their jobs and collecting paychecks, after all. I'm glad to know that whatever work these actors get, their talents will never be wasted.OverallAt long last, my agony is at an end. I have completed Kampfer's two seasons and I say this with the utmost sincerity: do not watch this show. I certainly do not want to watch it ever again. Kampfer is one of the worst times I've ever had watching an anime. It has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not worth watching, even if it's by sheer morbid curiosity.

He/she is one of the worst protagonists in anime history, and the other girls are hardly any better.Mikoto and Akane are more interested in hooking up with Natsuru than, say, stopping Sakura. Shizuku is still the finest character in the show. She is the only with the greatest dedication at stopping Sakura, and I admit I find it amusing how easily she can run circles around Natsuru. She's the only character of this show with any semblance of dignity. Unfortunately, one good character is not enough to redeem such a worthless cast. (3/10)ArtMuch like the first series, this season doesn't exactly impress in terms of visual quality. The character designs look mediocre and done with the lowest effort humanly possible and the fight scenes aren't something to write home about, either. The only times the animation holds up is during the fanservice scenes, because the only thing Kampfer is interested in is titillating male viewers. With animation this terrible, it almost looks like the animators wanted this show to fail! (4/10)SoundThe soundtrack isn't bad, but not impressive either. The voice acting, on the other hand, is wonderful! Seriously, the voice actors cannot earn enough praise for rising above the material they're given and do their absolute best, even when their characters are not worthy of their talents. When a character is bad, I normally try to not hold it against the actor voicing them. They are just people doing their jobs and collecting paychecks, after all. I'm glad to know that whatever work these actors get, their talents will never be wasted.OverallAt long last, my agony is at an end. I have completed Kampfer's two seasons and I say this with the utmost sincerity: do not watch this show. I certainly do not want to watch it ever again. Kampfer is one of the worst times I've ever had watching an anime. It has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not worth watching, even if it's by sheer morbid curiosity. I regret having watched this show, especially because that was time I'm not getting back. Still, if my reviews of the Kampfer series prevent at least one person from watching it, then it's all worth it. That's it, that's all. Thanks for your time. the second is just a one-off story that sees Natsuru getting a part-time job because her breasts have become too big and she needs bras. *sigh* That's it. That's all the story this season gives us. There is no meaningful narrative progression whatsoever and the heroines are no closer to stopping whatever Sakura has planned than they were at the beginning. Also, why are we even calling them heroines? They are more interested in taking Natsuru's virginity than stopping the bad guys. This story is a complete and absolute disaster.

I have completed Kampfer's two seasons and I say this with the utmost sincerity: do not watch this show. I certainly do not want to watch it ever again. Kampfer is one of the worst times I've ever had watching an anime. It has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not worth watching, even if it's by sheer morbid curiosity. I regret having watched this show, especially because that was time I'm not getting back. Still, if my reviews of the Kampfer series prevent at least one person from watching it, then it's all worth it. That's it, that's all. Thanks for your time. the second is just a one-off story that sees Natsuru getting a part-time job because her breasts have become too big and she needs bras. *sigh* That's it. That's all the story this season gives us. There is no meaningful narrative progression whatsoever and the heroines are no closer to stopping whatever Sakura has planned than they were at the beginning. Also, why are we even calling them heroines? They are more interested in taking Natsuru's virginity than stopping the bad guys. This story is a complete and absolute disaster.

Shizuku is still the finest character in the show. She is the only with the greatest dedication at stopping Sakura, and I admit I find it amusing how easily she can run circles around Natsuru.

Shizuku is still the finest character in the show. She is the only with the greatest dedication at stopping Sakura, and I admit I find it amusing how easily she can run circles around Natsuru. She's the only character of this show with any semblance of dignity. Unfortunately, one good character is not enough to redeem such a worthless cast. (3/10)ArtMuch like the first series, this season doesn't exactly impress in terms of visual quality. The character designs look mediocre and done with the lowest effort humanly possible and the fight scenes aren't something to write home about, either. The only times the animation holds up is during the fanservice scenes, because the only thing Kampfer is interested in is titillating male viewers. With animation this terrible, it almost looks like the animators wanted this show to fail! (4/10)SoundThe soundtrack isn't bad, but not impressive either. The voice acting, on the other hand, is wonderful! Seriously, the voice actors cannot earn enough praise for rising above the material they're given and do their absolute best, even when their characters are not worthy of their talents. When a character is bad, I normally try to not hold it against the actor voicing them. They are just people doing their jobs and collecting paychecks, after all. I'm glad to know that whatever work these actors get, their talents will never be wasted.OverallAt long last, my agony is at an end. I have completed Kampfer's two seasons and I say this with the utmost sincerity: do not watch this show. I certainly do not want to watch it ever again. Kampfer is one of the worst times I've ever had watching an anime. It has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not worth watching, even if it's by sheer morbid curiosity. I regret having watched this show, especially because that was time I'm not getting back.

There is no meaningful narrative progression whatsoever and the heroines are no closer to stopping whatever Sakura has planned than they were at the beginning.

Shizuku is still the finest character in the show. She is the only with the greatest dedication at stopping Sakura, and I admit I find it amusing how easily she can run circles around Natsuru. She's the only character of this show with any semblance of dignity. Unfortunately, one good character is not enough to redeem such a worthless cast. (3/10)ArtMuch like the first series, this season doesn't exactly impress in terms of visual quality. The character designs look mediocre and done with the lowest effort humanly possible and the fight scenes aren't something to write home about, either.

Seriously, the voice actors cannot earn enough praise for rising above the material they're given and do their absolute best, even when their characters are not worthy of their talents.

Why, you may ask? I don't know. The series never really explored this. We never discover why the Kampfers are fighting in the first place and this season only reminds us of things we already know.The first episode only barely moves the story forward, while...the second is just a one-off story that sees Natsuru getting a part-time job because her breasts have become too big and she needs bras. *sigh* That's it. That's all the story this season gives us. There is no meaningful narrative progression whatsoever and the heroines are no closer to stopping whatever Sakura has planned than they were at the beginning. Also, why are we even calling them heroines? They are more interested in taking Natsuru's virginity than stopping the bad guys. This story is a complete and absolute disaster. (2/10)CharactersNatsuru continues to be a pathetic and useless moron who just stands around and lets others do all the heavy-lifting for him/her. At no point does he/she ever try to be useful to his/her team. He/she is one of the worst protagonists in anime history, and the other girls are hardly any better.Mikoto and Akane are more interested in hooking up with Natsuru than, say, stopping Sakura. Shizuku is still the finest character in the show. She is the only with the greatest dedication at stopping Sakura, and I admit I find it amusing how easily she can run circles around Natsuru. She's the only character of this show with any semblance of dignity. Unfortunately, one good character is not enough to redeem such a worthless cast. (3/10)ArtMuch like the first series, this season doesn't exactly impress in terms of visual quality. The character designs look mediocre and done with the lowest effort humanly possible and the fight scenes aren't something to write home about, either. The only times the animation holds up is during the fanservice scenes, because the only thing Kampfer is interested in is titillating male viewers. With animation this terrible, it almost looks like the animators wanted this show to fail! (4/10)SoundThe soundtrack isn't bad, but not impressive either. The voice acting, on the other hand, is wonderful! Seriously, the voice actors cannot earn enough praise for rising above the material they're given and do their absolute best, even when their characters are not worthy of their talents. When a character is bad, I normally try to not hold it against the actor voicing them. They are just people doing their jobs and collecting paychecks, after all. I'm glad to know that whatever work these actors get, their talents will never be wasted.OverallAt long last, my agony is at an end. I have completed Kampfer's two seasons and I say this with the utmost sincerity: do not watch this show. I certainly do not want to watch it ever again. Kampfer is one of the worst times I've ever had watching an anime. It has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not worth watching, even if it's by sheer morbid curiosity.

We never discover why the Kampfers are fighting in the first place and this season only reminds us of things we already know.The first episode only barely moves the story forward, while...the second is just a one-off story that sees Natsuru getting a part-time job because her breasts have become too big and she needs bras. *sigh* That's it. That's all the story this season gives us. There is no meaningful narrative progression whatsoever and the heroines are no closer to stopping whatever Sakura has planned than they were at the beginning. Also, why are we even calling them heroines? They are more interested in taking Natsuru's virginity than stopping the bad guys. This story is a complete and absolute disaster. (2/10)CharactersNatsuru continues to be a pathetic and useless moron who just stands around and lets others do all the heavy-lifting for him/her. At no point does he/she ever try to be useful to his/her team. He/she is one of the worst protagonists in anime history, and the other girls are hardly any better.Mikoto and Akane are more interested in hooking up with Natsuru than, say, stopping Sakura. Shizuku is still the finest character in the show. She is the only with the greatest dedication at stopping Sakura, and I admit I find it amusing how easily she can run circles around Natsuru. She's the only character of this show with any semblance of dignity. Unfortunately, one good character is not enough to redeem such a worthless cast. (3/10)ArtMuch like the first series, this season doesn't exactly impress in terms of visual quality. The character designs look mediocre and done with the lowest effort humanly possible and the fight scenes aren't something to write home about, either. The only times the animation holds up is during the fanservice scenes, because the only thing Kampfer is interested in is titillating male viewers. With animation this terrible, it almost looks like the animators wanted this show to fail! (4/10)SoundThe soundtrack isn't bad, but not impressive either. The voice acting, on the other hand, is wonderful! Seriously, the voice actors cannot earn enough praise for rising above the material they're given and do their absolute best, even when their characters are not worthy of their talents. When a character is bad, I normally try to not hold it against the actor voicing them. They are just people doing their jobs and collecting paychecks, after all. I'm glad to know that whatever work these actors get, their talents will never be wasted.OverallAt long last, my agony is at an end. I have completed Kampfer's two seasons and I say this with the utmost sincerity: do not watch this show. I certainly do not want to watch it ever again. Kampfer is one of the worst times I've ever had watching an anime. It has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not worth watching, even if it's by sheer morbid curiosity. I regret having watched this show, especially because that was time I'm not getting back. Still, if my reviews of the Kampfer series prevent at least one person from watching it, then it's all worth it. That's it, that's all.

She's the only character of this show with any semblance of dignity. Unfortunately, one good character is not enough to redeem such a worthless cast. (3/10)ArtMuch like the first series, this season doesn't exactly impress in terms of visual quality. The character designs look mediocre and done with the lowest effort humanly possible and the fight scenes aren't something to write home about, either.

With animation this terrible, it almost looks like the animators wanted this show to fail! (4/10)SoundThe soundtrack isn't bad, but not impressive either. The voice acting, on the other hand, is wonderful! Seriously, the voice actors cannot earn enough praise for rising above the material they're given and do their absolute best, even when their characters are not worthy of their talents. When a character is bad, I normally try to not hold it against the actor voicing them. They are just people doing their jobs and collecting paychecks, after all. I'm glad to know that whatever work these actors get, their talents will never be wasted.OverallAt long last, my agony is at an end. I have completed Kampfer's two seasons and I say this with the utmost sincerity: do not watch this show. I certainly do not want to watch it ever again. Kampfer is one of the worst times I've ever had watching an anime. It has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not worth watching, even if it's by sheer morbid curiosity. I regret having watched this show, especially because that was time I'm not getting back. Still, if my reviews of the Kampfer series prevent at least one person from watching it, then it's all worth it. That's it, that's all. Thanks for your time. the second is just a one-off story that sees Natsuru getting a part-time job because her breasts have become too big and she needs bras. *sigh* That's it. That's all the story this season gives us. There is no meaningful narrative progression whatsoever and the heroines are no closer to stopping whatever Sakura has planned than they were at the beginning. Also, why are we even calling them heroines? They are more interested in taking Natsuru's virginity than stopping the bad guys. This story is a complete and absolute disaster.

I have completed Kampfer's two seasons and I say this with the utmost sincerity: do not watch this show. I certainly do not want to watch it ever again. Kampfer is one of the worst times I've ever had watching an anime. It has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not worth watching, even if it's by sheer morbid curiosity. I regret having watched this show, especially because that was time I'm not getting back. Still, if my reviews of the Kampfer series prevent at least one person from watching it, then it's all worth it. That's it, that's all. Thanks for your time. the second is just a one-off story that sees Natsuru getting a part-time job because her breasts have become too big and she needs bras. *sigh* That's it. That's all the story this season gives us. There is no meaningful narrative progression whatsoever and the heroines are no closer to stopping whatever Sakura has planned than they were at the beginning. Also, why are we even calling them heroines? They are more interested in taking Natsuru's virginity than stopping the bad guys. This story is a complete and absolute disaster.

Shizuku is still the finest character in the show. She is the only with the greatest dedication at stopping Sakura, and I admit I find it amusing how easily she can run circles around Natsuru.

Shizuku is still the finest character in the show. She is the only with the greatest dedication at stopping Sakura, and I admit I find it amusing how easily she can run circles around Natsuru. She's the only character of this show with any semblance of dignity. Unfortunately, one good character is not enough to redeem such a worthless cast. (3/10)ArtMuch like the first series, this season doesn't exactly impress in terms of visual quality. The character designs look mediocre and done with the lowest effort humanly possible and the fight scenes aren't something to write home about, either. The only times the animation holds up is during the fanservice scenes, because the only thing Kampfer is interested in is titillating male viewers. With animation this terrible, it almost looks like the animators wanted this show to fail! (4/10)SoundThe soundtrack isn't bad, but not impressive either. The voice acting, on the other hand, is wonderful! Seriously, the voice actors cannot earn enough praise for rising above the material they're given and do their absolute best, even when their characters are not worthy of their talents. When a character is bad, I normally try to not hold it against the actor voicing them. They are just people doing their jobs and collecting paychecks, after all. I'm glad to know that whatever work these actors get, their talents will never be wasted.OverallAt long last, my agony is at an end. I have completed Kampfer's two seasons and I say this with the utmost sincerity: do not watch this show. I certainly do not want to watch it ever again. Kampfer is one of the worst times I've ever had watching an anime. It has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not worth watching, even if it's by sheer morbid curiosity. I regret having watched this show, especially because that was time I'm not getting back.

Thanks for your time."", ""A small continuation to the original 12 episodes. It's good and apparently contains a lot more fanservice scenes than usual. This will not disappoint Kampfer viewers at all. There's no ending to the series but who cares. I honestly would like more Kampfer episodes. "", ""These are not so much OVA's as the end of the main series.  OVA 1 should have literally been the last episode of the main series.  While episode 12 of the main should have been OVA 1.  AKA the correct order to watch these is Series episodes 1-11, OVA 1, (OVA 2, EP 12).  OVA 2, and episode 12 could be slipped into the middle of the series without  much trouble, though OVA 2 does seem to work better as a postscript.Even with the OVA's and watching in the correct order it's a series with a non ending. Not...a cliffhanger just a non ending. You are pretty much stopped in the middle with most of the questions unresolved.The story goes no place. The characters are at best weak.  Natsura may well be the most clueless man in the history of Anime. We are talking about a guy who needs a minder to cross a street.  The girls are mostly described as at best flat. This really weakens the comedy.Verdict: It's a meh. a cliffhanger just a non ending. You are pretty much stopped in the middle with most of the questions unresolved.The story goes no place.

I just want to get this over with.StoryThis new season continues right after the first season left off, with Natsuru and his/her friends discovering that Sakura has been working with the Moderators to keep all Kampfers under their thrall. Why, you may ask? I don't know. The series never really explored this. We never discover why the Kampfers are fighting in the first place and this season only reminds us of things we already know.The first episode only barely moves the story forward, while...the second is just a one-off story that sees Natsuru getting a part-time job because her breasts have become too big and she needs bras. *sigh* That's it. That's all the story this season gives us. There is no meaningful narrative progression whatsoever and the heroines are no closer to stopping whatever Sakura has planned than they were at the beginning. Also, why are we even calling them heroines? They are more interested in taking Natsuru's virginity than stopping the bad guys. This story is a complete and absolute disaster. (2/10)CharactersNatsuru continues to be a pathetic and useless moron who just stands around and lets others do all the heavy-lifting for him/her. At no point does he/she ever try to be useful to his/her team. He/she is one of the worst protagonists in anime history, and the other girls are hardly any better.Mikoto and Akane are more interested in hooking up with Natsuru than, say, stopping Sakura. Shizuku is still the finest character in the show. She is the only with the greatest dedication at stopping Sakura, and I admit I find it amusing how easily she can run circles around Natsuru. She's the only character of this show with any semblance of dignity. Unfortunately, one good character is not enough to redeem such a worthless cast. (3/10)ArtMuch like the first series, this season doesn't exactly impress in terms of visual quality. The character designs look mediocre and done with the lowest effort humanly possible and the fight scenes aren't something to write home about, either. The only times the animation holds up is during the fanservice scenes, because the only thing Kampfer is interested in is titillating male viewers. With animation this terrible, it almost looks like the animators wanted this show to fail! (4/10)SoundThe soundtrack isn't bad, but not impressive either. The voice acting, on the other hand, is wonderful! Seriously, the voice actors cannot earn enough praise for rising above the material they're given and do their absolute best, even when their characters are not worthy of their talents. When a character is bad, I normally try to not hold it against the actor voicing them. They are just people doing their jobs and collecting paychecks, after all. I'm glad to know that whatever work these actors get, their talents will never be wasted.OverallAt long last, my agony is at an end. I have completed Kampfer's two seasons and I say this with the utmost sincerity: do not watch this show. I certainly do not want to watch it ever again. Kampfer is one of the worst times I've ever had watching an anime. It has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not worth watching, even if it's by sheer morbid curiosity.
