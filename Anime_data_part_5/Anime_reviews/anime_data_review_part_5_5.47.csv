Duan Nao,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28673/Duan_Nao,"['I gave Die Now all around 10s because it\'s a show that can never be truly rated. The pacing is terrible, the characters make no sense, the plot twists are meaningless, everything about Die Now is a dumpster fire.However, as 2016 was progressing Die Now was the show I was most excited for. More than Konosuba, Erased and Re:Zero. Die Now had me hooked. It was a surprise each time a new episode was aired and the show was impossible to predict.Die Now is one thing and one thing only, a testament to humanity. A work truly creative and unique. Seeing is believing...and you won\'t believe what you see. A world where absurdity reigns supreme and anything can happen. The show is a comedy in the perfect sense. There was nothing but pure entertainment as I watched it.I suggest this show to anyone who can kick back and ""Just accept it and move on with your life."" Grab a couple friends and watch Die Now. People who won\'t care if the story moves lightning fast and you can\'t keep up. Rewatch the crazy scene I\'m loathe to spoil in episode 2 trying to figure out why the the protagonist knows the first 10 digits of 1/19 or why 1/19 is relevant in the first place. and you won\'t believe what you see.

At the time of creation of the anime, the manhua off which this is based was considered one of the ""big three"" shounen-type pieces on u17 (alongside Chu Feng and Zhen Hun Jie). Out of these three, Die Now is the only anime that has stuck to the original storyline with only minor alterations.The premise of this story is quite simple. Once you look past the initial layer of suspense, the series becomes about a...virtual reality gaming platform with high stakes. This makes the show very plot-driven, dedicating a lot of screen time to the game rules and gaming content. Thus, if you love seeing a highly competent male lead solve puzzles and play mafia-type games with inhuman wit and intelligence (kind of like Sora from No Game No Life but with a damsel-in-distress girlfriend instead of a cute sister), then this series is definitely recommended for you.Apart from the plot, the show does a fairly good job with suspense-building, as is expected from works by the original manhua author. So the first few episodes especially will leave you on-edge with unanswered questions. This was what drew me to the show initially and prompted me to binge watch everything in one sitting. Unfortunately, the original author is not just known for his suspense building. He is also notorious for his treatment of female characters and slightly perverted sense of humor. Fortunately, though, these factors are not too prevalent in the anime. However, I understand that viewers might not be very happy with the characterization of females. There is also a rather perverted older male character, which you will either really like or really hate.In terms of sound and animation quality, both are pretty decent. There aren\'t any stunning illustrations or music that tugs at your heartstrings, but it\'s certainly up-to-par with your average Japanese anime, so no criticism there. The voice actors...eh...I guess it all depends on whether you\'re used to listening to your typical group of mandarin voice actors or not. But I\'d say it\'s fairly decent.A final warning is that I haven\'t watched the series since 2015, so my impression of details are purely from memory. I was upset at how few comprehensive reviews this show has on this site, though, so I just had to write one as soon as possible. virtual reality gaming platform with high stakes.

The story is nothing like this. It's about a boy who is a part of a school detective club who goes in search of his missing girlfriend and stumbles across the equivalent of an underground gaming community.A high, tech, merderous, gaming community where people are pitched into some alternate scenarios/ environments.What I liked about the show was the gaming parts. Interesting. The main character is shown to be intelligent, just very stupid when he comes to to his girlfriend but then again, I think he's still in school....The girls in the anime are kind of unfairly treated at times, but that for the viewer to decide. Just kept wondering why the boys got full on gear while the grils got short skirts that did not protect their legs. (fan service)Here's the thing. It's not until the last episode that the reason for the games are shown, somewhat and the story comes to an end without a conclusion. Is there a season 2?Would I watch this agian. No. But if you are an anime fan who is looking for a some 15 min episodes that involve stepping into a game, here you are. Only, I think a few games like Overlord etc did that concept better.

It is like a mix of the Hunger Games and Death Note, where any ""friend"" can betray you in the blink of an eye, and you never know what a character is truly thinking until the very end when all is revealed.The whole show is very unpredictable, shrouded in mysteries which seem at first impossible to solve but all makes sense in the end, which is incredibly satisfying. The plot twists, puzzles, psychological elements and characters are brilliant, and the hardly comprehensible synopsis and the low ratings do not...do it any justice at all. This will be of great interest to anyone that enjoys detective stories, intellectual puzzles or even solving math problems.This anime is about an university lad that risks his life to find his girlfriend in what seems like an alternate universe which (trying to avoid spoilers here) might not be so alternate after all. There, he goes through a series of dangerous real-life puzzle games versus other contestants, usually strangers, in order to advance through this strange new world. These games test not only mental agility but physical ability - failure to run fast enough, shoot accurately or use a weapon efficiently will mean certain loss. Players exist in both worlds, so drama can ensue not just in the game but in either universe. Each player is ranked on a points based system, so dying in a game may not mean certain death in the real world, but having a negative score will.His girlfriend is a bit of a sap, but other than that all the characters are very intelligent, focused and relatable to some degree. Each episode challenges you to think and the way that the characters, especially the main character, solves the problems never fails to impress.My only complaint is that some (only a few) of the deductions made by characters can seem a little far fetched, however this doesn\'t confuse the storyline. As of yet after reading the manga I haven\'t detected any unfilled plot holes.If you like drama, life and death suspense situations, clever puzzles and plot twists and shocking betrayals, then this is the anime for you. do it any justice at all.

Code-E,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2564/Code-E,"[""Code-E is a fun but short anime that brings mixed bag of opinions. From the start the show throws the user a pretty deep question, &quot;How would you live your life if you can't touch practically anything?&quot;Story (Good)That is the problem our main character faces on a daily basis. Set in the not too distant future where more people are more reliant on electronics and automation, Chinami Ebihara is a perfect example of a victim of circumstance (with the help of stereotypical moe). Well you see, Chinami can't touch anything electrical because she emits EMP waves from her body. And thats not a fun...power to have in the information age. This show pretty much follows her around and shows how a woman like herself would live such a difficult life. The story may sound a little off the wall but you will most likely actually feel sorry for Chinami and get more interested in her life. That is untill you meet her friends...Character (Decent)The Ebihara is a perfect example of a typical family, mom and dad work, they drink beer and they love each other. Reminds me of my own family practically. Chinami's chemistry to her family is executed perfectly in my opinion. Perfectly as in you can actually feel sorry for them and see that they actually care for each other even though they all live busy lives. But as i stated before, her 'friends' kind of break up that perfect harmony. Well she starts off without having any, then she befriends the cute girl that sits in front of her (love her twin tails btw). That is all fine and dandy then, some guy named Kotaro Kannagi enters to the fray. How they meet isn't that important but one cant realize how this stupid, arrogant, and borderline stalker becomes Chinami's friend and appears throughout the whole series. On top of that this stalker has a very cute and nice (and rich) girlfriend named Sonomi Kujo. The further you progress in the story it becomes more apparent that this mix of friends is what brings down this show in terms of common sense and ridiculousness. Also I'm not a real fan of the main male role being stupid as hell. I really liked the Chinami family but for the most part, everything else was very poor. There are more characters but its up to you to think they're that important to the show or not.Sound (Fair)The sound is pretty mediocre as well. The seiyu's do their duty and pull off perfect voice acting (as usual) where they all act their part fine and there are not problems with them. But everything else is average. With the exception of school room chatter, environmental sounds was very lacking. A lot of nature scenes, but not a lot of  nature sounds, a lot of city scenes, but not a lot of city noise. Theres nothing terrible about the sound, air brakes of the bus hiss and pop like normal, static crackles and zaps, etc. But nothing makes the sound spectacular or to write about with the exception of the voice cast. Even the opening and closing songs are actually pretty bad, but I'll leave it at that.Art (Very Good)The art and animation is probably the shows saving grace. If you don't care about most of the characters as much (like me), then you will be at least intrigued by the 'not too distant future' they tried to make up. Theres automated buses, video billboards, everyone has cellphones that can do anything, and they even has a few DoCoMo ads for good measure. My favorite part of the technology where the school blackboards were essentially a refined version of a Microsoft Surface (google it). Since technology is also about small things some great detail were given to some scenes. All the technology was fun to look at but they even took the time to show a lot of nature and non technological areas to show that the WHOLE world isn't that engrossed in technology yet. The art itself is pretty much standard fare for a 2008 anime. Crisp, clean, colorful, and moderately detailed. Its not gonna win anything for the art but then again it doesn't look like Speed Racer either.Enjoyment (Good)Overall, the show shows a lot of promise and the Code-E universe was so intriguing that I couldn't stop watching. No matter how much I hate Kannagi I can't help but look forward to the next season. I hope they make even more convincing inventions the next time around.Verdict (6.4) power to have in the information age.

Then there\'s the science geek and surprise surprise the childhood friend of the geek...Oh yes there\'s also the cold,distant outsider..So there you go,cookie cutter characters in every possible way imaginable.Don\'t get me wrong the anime industry is awash with generic characters but when the entire series lacks any character development whatsoever then what\'s the point?So throughout the entirety of the series there\'s no character development even for the laugh of it and by the end of the series i didn\'t see any development in their interactions as well.One would have thought it\'s a common knowledge that in Drama/comedy anime to include actual characterisation and comedy.This feels contrived and like it was botched together by fish.So the characters are unquestionably the worst the world has to offer,what about the plotline?Well there\'s nothing to report on that front too..There\'s something there about finding out what Chinami’s ability is,but by the end of the series we learn nothing new or crucial.Midway through we are introduced to a spy duo but they barely get any screen time and don\'t get your hopes high about any background or motive...Ah yeah there was also this ""mastermind"" but he vanished to obscurity after a while for no reason at all,no explanations given.And don\'t think that the end was anything grandiose by any means cause it wasn\'t..Now there\'s a second season and i can\'t for the life of me understand why..Why did they feel the need to continue with this monstrosity.To sum it up,yes the music is good,the animation is also good compared to the 90\'s but even if it had the best-groundbreaking animation with nothing to back it up there\'s no point.I don\'t believe there\'s anyone out there anywhere in the universe who can possibly like this..Now run and don\'t look back. by things got any better cause they didn\'t..Ok imagine diving into a pool and suddenly hitting a black hole and suddenly you find yourself diving into the pits of hell...And here\'s the best part...It doesn\'t end..You\'re in a loop,diving forevermore into the wombs of nightmares.If i could hit the rating to minus 100 i would without hesitation or breaking a sweat over it..And you might think that this kind of rating is an overkill but hell no it isn\'t.Any rating above the minus 100 mark would be preposterous,an insult to every bad anime i\'ve rated almost just as low as this.And remember this anime is from 2007 so it comes ready with some good-ish production value but everything else wouldn\'t cut it even in 1950\'s and the 50\'s were notorious for having washing machines with a little mouse called Jerry running in his little wheel to power it.And that kind of thing wasn\'t enjoyable to either you or the mouse cause it would take months to wash your filthy underwear and the mouse would be dead from exhaustion and you\'d need to buy another one.And they were extremely expensive.There are better ways to do things and that\'s exactly the case with this anime,there are way better alternatives.The characters give you the first hint that this anime is trully a failure in every aspect.Mediocrity would be an overstatement and as the episode count goes up so do their flaws.Chinami is the usual girl wearing glasses,is clumsy and screams like...Erm...A girl when a mosquito flies next to her.

There is...one scene in which Ebihara is running from Kanagi and for all intents and purposes simply fails to hide from him from a visual point of view, but somehow just is hidden, and the story expects us to follow it.- The story often doesn\'t include the viewer and just marches on; There is dialogue that you didn\'t see, important meetings between characters to discuss things that actually don\'t show, but somehow all these characters just now have more information about everything going on and you just have to deal with it- The believability of the story wavers significantly; The emotional believability is extremely strong to start with, and the setting is extremely inclusive and entertaining, but about half way through it loses a lot of that.- The music simply never makes any sense at all. Ever. Its always wrong and if you are going to watch the show, know this one thing especially before you dive in, because at first it just confuses the hell out of you! in the opening scene you thing ""Gritty Crime drama!"" and seconds later you are in slice-of-life mode, and its a roller coaster of confusion, as if the roller coaster keeps going up and then you end up back at the start without ever going down.- (minor spoiler)This series near-Literally contains Team Rocket, AND YOU NEVER FIND OUT WHY.- There is a huge gap in the story. You will never find out what it is, ever. Not even once. It is not alluded to, and there is no actual way to work it out. It\'s just missing.Basically, this series fucked up. It just did. It was completely off, it should have been about Ebihara dealing with an extremely taxing power and getting through it, and it kind of was, but it was also just... something else entirely. it really should have been like ""Kotoro-San"", it just wasn\'t, and what happened was confusing and badly put together. There aren\'t any major visual fumbles, and there are good parts, but its seriously bad.Lets go to the good parts;Voice Acting - it just doesn\'t suck. I think that Ebihara\'s parents, ironically, were the best acted of all of the characters, by quite a long shot. I would hire them again on the spot if i were another casting company.Character - There were bad characters, and there were good ones. The good ones were quite good, the bad ones were quite bad. Kanagi is the worst written character I\'ve ever seen, and Ebihara\'s dad is fantastic. The series also contains a Tsundere and I haven\'t put that in the good or bad basket because everyone likes a certain type so whatever.Setting - The idea was amazing, the delivery was ok.Enjoyment - I enjoyed every confusing second of this anime. I would have a hard time telling you why. It was just good. It makes you happy, and following Ebihara around as she struggles to deal with normal situations is endearing and entertaining.Overall we get a 6. But watch it though, just do.

The anime is an OK watch but nothing amazing, despite having some great potential. The main issues for me boil down to a few key factors. First the story seems to have a hard time balancing its two main plots, the romance that builds between the main character and the male lead as their relationship starts and grows, and the conspiracy in the background with shadowy agencies and people being interested in people who have powers like the main character. The opening even seems to have trouble deciding if it wants...to be like a spy thriller or a generic romance story with action shots and the obligatory scenery shots.Second the characters are somewhat bland but not completely flat. The male lead, Koutarou, is obsessed with science and initially takes interest in our female lead, Chinami, strictly as a point of scientific curiosity in regards to her powers. He eventually starts to show some emotion outside of being obsessed with science, but even then he feels generic.The female lead, Chinami, is at least believable in her timidness and lack of understanding of her own emotions since she has little social experience due to the problems her powers cause and her family constantly moving to protect her. However her powers, one of her key defining features, are hardly expanded upon and are used more as an obstacle than a gift. While she learns to control her EM discharge over time with the help of a fellow type E and the male lead, she doesn't seem to try and actively use her powers.The second female lead, Sonomi, just gets shafted so bad in terms of the plot. She is introduced to the story because of her love for the male lead and her mistaken belief that Chinami is trying to steal him. This leads her to come off as an entitled bitch as she constantly gets depressed seeing Chinami and Koutarou together and is really mean to Chinami. She softens a lot once she realizes that Chinami has powers and figures out that Koutarou is interested in her powers. However as time goes on she comes to realize that Koutarou is indeed in love with Chinami and basically gives up even encouraging him to go find Chinami. Her character feels like she was there to fulfil a cliche and to be the rich girl that helps move the plot along by providing the characters with a lab to research Chinami's powers and even helping sort the data about her powers.The Brinberg twins appear to be a bumbling pair of incompetents who are investigating Chinami in order to somehow restore their family's power. However the way this would work, kidnapping, recruiting, use of her powers, etc etc, is never explained and instead they function mostly as comic relief. They do occasionally help with the plot such as helping Chinami realize that she loves Koutarou by the sister Mils confessing to him in a ploy to use him in order to get to Chinami, and possibly for his scientific prowess as well, and by providing exposition in a few rare cases such as mapping out the rough range of Chinami's powers when she was near her emotional breaking point and caused a massive power outage.The third issue I have with the series is that when it decides that it wants to be more akin to a spy thriller with the Brinberg twins, the mysterious Hiiragi, people wanting to gain control of Type E's, the powers of Type E's, and how this all comes together in the final few episodes, the show lacks exposition. The viewer is left to piece together information from what little exposition was given throughout the anime.For instance the final few episodes seem to display animals having powers like Chinami and Saihashi, but the plot never explains why they have powers or why they are gathering beyond an implication that is was all because of some plan by Hiirag in the case of the latteri. Their powers are not explained and the viewer is left to figure out that the meteor that fell 20 years prior to the story, and only shown once at the beginning of the first episode, must have fallen in the lake near the area as seen on the map displayed for the city complex where the summer school is held. The meteor, like the one talked about in the exposition in episode 7 explaining the theory of how electric eels gained their electric cells as the result of the muticulim virus, is presumed to have had the same virus on it and that infected the animals giving them their powers. Further it is never explained why having a large group of Type E's together seems to form a type of resonance and increase their power output, nor why this seems to lead to what the anime refers to as decay in proportion to Type E interference, which this phrase is never spoken but simply shown on a computer screen as a building comes crashing down.Finally the ending of the series did a horrible job of setting up for a sequel and explaining where all of the characters are in terms of their current arcs. Chinami is never confronted by Sonomi for stealing Kotarou's heart, Mils survival from the building collapse is never clarified, we get no real explanation as to Hiiragi's intentions, and while Kotarou and Chinami confess to each other we are never shown anything beyond the implication that everyone from the school will be saved by the rescue squad who were in route and were able to find a place to land thanks to all of the flora and fauna around Chinami reacting to her em waves and glowing florescent green, the glow never being explained either but the cause implied by 2 characters thinking of Chinami when they see it. Also to make things even more confusing there is an earlier scene where we see a tank of green glowing firefly squid.Overall the anime feels like wasted potential with subpar story telling, a lack of exposition, incomplete plot lines, and a semi bland male lead who fulfils the cliche of making sure his childhood friend doesn't have her love requited because the new girl appeared. to be like a spy thriller or a generic romance story with action shots and the obligatory scenery shots.Second the characters are somewhat bland but not completely flat.

There is very little time spent on any characterization, let alone character development.

Forget that, I didn't even know it was an anime in the first place. Somehow I ended up realizing it was one and that is when I decided to give it a watch. Having only four episodes, it's pretty short but doesn't feel incomplete or missing something huge. It's worth a watch with the family, given it has clean action (no blood/gore), zero profanity or adult content.I was slightly expecting to be disappointed given the 3D orientation. However, the mixing of 2D backgrounds with 3D characters and objects was pretty splendid in my opinion. Voice acting...also worked pretty well for almost all the characters. Action scenes were also pretty good throughout. The pacing was also good, and helped me finish the episodes without any break. Music was fine, and the message was decent.

They did okay here. The character models feel a little stiff here and there but for the most part it looks fine. Nothing stellar that's going to blow your mind and make you rethink how you feel about the medium, just a serviceable level of polish.The story is interesting, heartwarming, and optimistic about our future as a species. It's cool to see robots used in this way, and the twist reveal actually caught me off guard, something I don't experience often being the jaded weeb I am.I give it a nice 7/10 "", 'Occasionally, it is nice to fill up a cup of water and slowly enjoy the lukewarm feeling run down. Eden proves that animation and story matter in a show just as flavor is desired in a drink.Eden is a story that drives the cliché plot of ""would the world be better without humans"", which I wouldn\'t necessarily complain about... if it had anything else to go along with it. The story rides on the single piece of conflict introduced in episode 1 making it lack the x-factor needs to become interesting. The dialog is painfully generic to the point where I have a hard time...liking any of the characters because of how 1-dimentional they are. And although the story takes place in a beautiful land cultivated by futuristic robots, the animation and set quality are... to be desired to say the least. It feels like the same engine RWBY season 1 ran on, but without any of the cool fight sequences.However; there is a saving grace. The music is absolutely beautiful. There were moments in the show I got chills because the music was just that amazing. Kevin Penkin made the show for me. With 64 minutes of music to go with the show\'s run time of around 90 minutes, Eden feels more like a project to highlight the interesting designs and music more than anything.Back to my point about Eden being water, the music and art is incredibly refreshing, even if everything else about Eden is bland. I wouldn\'t watch it if you are on the hunt for a masterpiece or even if you\'re trying to burn time. I\'d say the best time to watch this is if you are tired and just want to take a quick break. 6/10 liking any of the characters because of how 1-dimentional they are.

Happy Happy Clover,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5276/Happy_Happy_Clover,"[""The anime is fairly episodic, but the story it does tell is done well. The characters live in a communistic society mainly due to the abundance of resources devaluing goods. Services are not traded for each other but instead the citizens simply feel obligated to contribute in the way they can. In their town a certain job was not being done correctly so the protagonists, whom are children, take it upon themselves to make sure this duty is done well. Through this job they learn more about their world and mature as characters.The art in this anime is quite different from other series. The characters...are all animals and are not anthropomorphic, but they use their body parts in humanoid ways. The fantastical plants introduced in the series are modeled well. The background art is decent but not too noteworthy.The voice actors do a good job at portraying their animal characters. You can feel the emotion when it's needed and the bad raps are exactly what you would expect from how the characters react to them. The sounds of nature are done well.The child protagonists were written exactly how children actually act. They may seem clueless or selfish at times, but it's always for good reason. The friendship and romance between the characters is fun to see as well as the pranks they play on each other. The characters are all quite deep and they all have their own role to play. The adults have interesting jobs related to what animal they are and they make good use of their skills. It's one of the most interesting and diverse casts I've seen.Part of the reason why I loved this anime so much is because of its resemblance to TV shows and movies I've seen in my childhood. Not many anime have animal casts and not many TV series with animal casts have them written this well. Their culture is different from our own, but it seems realistic for what they are. It's fun learning new rules about the flora unique to their world and how the inhabitants use them to their advantage. With all of the world building and character development this story could go on for a long time without seeming repetitive, but even with its short run time it manages to do a lot.This anime is fun for kids to watch, but there's also a lot of depth to it. As a kids' series it has some strong role models and shows kids what consequences their actions may have and what the best solutions to certain problems would be.

Kyoushirou to Towa no Sora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1810/Kyoushirou_to_Towa_no_Sora,"['-INTRODUCTION-When I first came across Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora and looked at a couple of screenshots, I decided for myself that I would be staying away from this anime. However, my love for seiyuu as well as my curiousity got the better of me, and I watched it after all. It was not as bad as I expected, and in fact, it was quite good. Not my cup of tea in general, but it did have some great points.-STORY- 7/10At first, I was pretty excited about the story. As cliche as it sounds, fairytale-like plot just doesn\'t get old for some people. However, as...time went by, it became more and more complex, and I wasn\'t sure whether it was changing for the better. The problem here is not with the story itself. It was a well thought out plot, with romance and family conflicts involved. But the elements used to display that plot were simply too much. Angels, mecha, cat girls, magic, science, all mixed into this seemingly simple story, did not improve it at all. Those elements looked more like fan service than anything else. Some stories are best if kept to the level of \'normal\', and Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora is one of those stories. I liked the idea of absolute angels, but there was just no need to include every possible fan service element out there to display it.Putting fan service aside and pretending that I didn\'t see little girls, giant mechas, and occasional unnecessary nudity all the time throughout Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora, it was indeed a rather nice story. In fact, the two final episodes touched me so greatly that I almost wanted to disregard all the downfalls. But looking back at it, I can\'t grade an anime based only on the first episode and a beautiful ending.-CHARACTERS- 10/10This is the strongest point of this anime. It has a lot of characters, and most of them are very unique. The main female character did not seem so impressive at first glance, but she developed and matured throughout the anime and became much more admirable. The seemingly invincible ""prince"" Kyoshiro turned out to have quite a few weaknesses and complexes. By the end of the series, he left me with an impression that he is not the kind that saves the princess, but is instead the kind that needs to be saved. I liked that a lot because perfect heroes are just boring and I can\'t sympathize with them. Setsuna\'s eternal loyalty toward Kyoshiro also touched me a lot. She was in my opinion the strongest of the females; after all, not everyone can stay by the side of their beloved person and not give in to selfish desires.Aside from the three leading ones, the background characters were also quite impressive. They had a purpose and their relationships with each other were well thought out and interesting to observe. I have to admit that to me the most memorable and brightest of them all turned out to be Kyoshiro\'s older brother, who was also the most shocking one and truly made the series more enjoyable.-ART/ANIMATION- 8/10The art is very pretty but nothing too outstanding. Character designs are very well done and interesting. The animation is also great. However, once again, it seemed overdone. Extremely bright colors and sparkling scenes. It is definitely a matter of opinion, but personally I found it too hard on the eyes and simply distracting, considering that the story is nowhere near a comedy. It would have gotten full marks if it was not so colorful.-SOUND- 9/10The opening and ending themes are simple, but nice and catchy. They fit perfectly well for this kind of anime. The background music during the battles and during Kuu\'s talks to her prince is very impressive and greatly increases the dramatic impact. Overall, the soundtrack could have been even better, but in this case it really doesn\'t need to be. The music choice in this anime is a perfect fit and doesn\'t need to stand out any more than it does.The seiyuu work was, of course, outstanding, and I will spare you my unprofessional fangirl comments. I will mention, though, that Kazuya is probably the most impressive role that I heard from Narita Ken so far.---It\'s the kind of anime that you can only truly appreciate if you look deeper, past all the fan service. Unless, of course, fan service is what you are looking for -- it has plenty ^_~ time went by, it became more and more complex, and I wasn\'t sure whether it was changing for the better.

I liked the idea of absolute angels, but there was just no need to include every possible fan service element out there to display it.Putting fan service aside and pretending that I didn\'t see little girls, giant mechas, and occasional unnecessary nudity all the time throughout Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora, it was indeed a rather nice story. In fact, the two final episodes touched me so greatly that I almost wanted to disregard all the downfalls. But looking back at it, I can\'t grade an anime based only on the first episode and a beautiful ending.-CHARACTERS- 10/10This is the strongest point of this anime. It has a lot of characters, and most of them are very unique. The main female character did not seem so impressive at first glance, but she developed and matured throughout the anime and became much more admirable. The seemingly invincible ""prince"" Kyoshiro turned out to have quite a few weaknesses and complexes. By the end of the series, he left me with an impression that he is not the kind that saves the princess, but is instead the kind that needs to be saved. I liked that a lot because perfect heroes are just boring and I can\'t sympathize with them. Setsuna\'s eternal loyalty toward Kyoshiro also touched me a lot. She was in my opinion the strongest of the females; after all, not everyone can stay by the side of their beloved person and not give in to selfish desires.Aside from the three leading ones, the background characters were also quite impressive. They had a purpose and their relationships with each other were well thought out and interesting to observe. I have to admit that to me the most memorable and brightest of them all turned out to be Kyoshiro\'s older brother, who was also the most shocking one and truly made the series more enjoyable.-ART/ANIMATION- 8/10The art is very pretty but nothing too outstanding. Character designs are very well done and interesting. The animation is also great. However, once again, it seemed overdone. Extremely bright colors and sparkling scenes. It is definitely a matter of opinion, but personally I found it too hard on the eyes and simply distracting, considering that the story is nowhere near a comedy. It would have gotten full marks if it was not so colorful.-SOUND- 9/10The opening and ending themes are simple, but nice and catchy. They fit perfectly well for this kind of anime. The background music during the battles and during Kuu\'s talks to her prince is very impressive and greatly increases the dramatic impact. Overall, the soundtrack could have been even better, but in this case it really doesn\'t need to be. The music choice in this anime is a perfect fit and doesn\'t need to stand out any more than it does.The seiyuu work was, of course, outstanding, and I will spare you my unprofessional fangirl comments. I will mention, though, that Kazuya is probably the most impressive role that I heard from Narita Ken so far.---It\'s the kind of anime that you can only truly appreciate if you look deeper, past all the fan service. Unless, of course, fan service is what you are looking for -- it has plenty ^_~', ""A truly gag-worthy anime.I must admit the series looks adorable from a stand-offish point of view but the storyline left something to be desired. The narration of Shiratori Kuu is very reminiscent of an airhead teen, 'cause frankly... She is one.But of COURSE she has to be something special. *rolls eyes*Aside from my obvious disdain for the main character. There were a few decent characters within the series. Setsuna being my favorite, she had more depth to her. If you choose to watch this anime do it to see Setsuna at the very least. Everything else? Not worth your time.

The story did not draw me in. It came across as a typical romance to me, the whole concept of 'Absolute angels' just looked an excuse to throw some mechs in there, and DEAR GOD did the character of Kuu piss me off in the first episode. I picked it up again sometime later to pass the time and I'm pretty glad I did. Despite the boring high school romance vibe the show gave me after the first episode, the show actually...did go off in a different direction than I expected and better one at that. The show is not all that great though and has a good number of flaws.STORY: 7If you're familiar with Kaisaku works then I'm pretty sure you'd be able to figure out how the story goes. Of course Kyoshiro has it's own story but it has many of the same cliches. I became  gradually more impressed with the story as the show when on. Although some of the main plot twists in the story were predictable I found myself surprisingly caught of guard by some. The concepts of absolute angels were fairly interesting and it gave an appealing backstory to them. The romance however was… well not that great. I didn’t feel anything from the main couple’s relationship. The relationship just felt kinda slapped on and forced. There’s just a series of confusing moments between them in the earlier episodes that made me question if they’d really even be that great of a couple. Plus we can’t for get the oh so exciting and original love triangle.The story however was decent enough to keep me interested after a few episodes though and if a story can do at least that then thats all I need to finish it till the end.ART/ANIMATION: 7I’ve never really found TNK’s art that exceptional. Of the anime’s I’ve seen animated by them the best ones would probably be Highschool DxD and this show, Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora. I have to admit the animation has improved greatly from Kaishaku last animated work “Kannazuki no Miko” who’s animation was below par. I enjoyed the artstyle of this show. The bright colors gave it a nice mood and the character designs were nicely done.The animation was… “meh” I think some of the fight scenes in earlier episodes were beautifully animated and something worth watching. Some of the animation in the less exciting scenes did not have as nice of quality. I noticed more and more of these lower quality scenes show up the closer I got to the end.SOUND: 6To be honest there was nothing noteworthy about the sound. The opening and ending theme weren’t that great of songs. They weren’t terrible of course but nothing worth remembering. There was only one OST that even stood out to me and I do like it but well… it’s only one. The Dub wasn’t bad at all. FUNimation does do a decent job of dubbing after all.  I prefer sub personally because Kuu’s voice in the dub just bugs me. It wasn’t bad acting infact the voice actually fit the character as she was rather annoying but hey I’ll get to that in the next section.CHARACTERS: 6I’d have to say the characters had to be both the best and worst part of this show. I personally found Kuu the main girl very annoying and I know she isn’t very liked by other fans. She herself doesn’t even develop much. She does a little bit but not as much as she could have considering her character’s personality. What develops most is her and Kyoshiro’s relationship instead of the actual characters. Kyoshiro actually becomes a different person than he was the beginning but his character is kind of a dull one. He’s a typical pretty boy and shares quite a few traits with a certain character from Kannazuki no Miko. Setsuna was pretty much the only main character I liked and the show wasn’t very kind to her. She comes across as one of the doll like characters, doing whatever she’s told but she does indeed have feelings of her own that become revealed as the story progresses.And then of course the only notable side characters are Kaon and Himiko as you all know as Chikane and Himeko. The only reason they are noteable is because they are probably the reason why 90% of this shows audience came from. Seeing them again was definitely a treat and their relationship was 10000x better than the main couples in my opinion.ENJOYMENT: 8Obviously this part is a bit bias. I did enjoy the show quite a bit after getting a few episodes into it and It kept me interested. I’m glad I watched it to the end even if the show does have it’s flaws.After averaging all the scores, I give Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora a 6.8/10 (rounded up to a 7) The least I can do is recommend you try the show if you’re into the Mecha, Fantasy and Romance genre’s (Especially if you enjoyed Kaisaku past works)  but be well aware of it’s flaws. If the romance and stuff doesn’t sound like something that will interest you’re probably wouldn't like it. did go off in a different direction than I expected and better one at that.

I guess I got it, because Kaon (Chikane) is as awesome as ever, if not better. Other than that, it was kind of hard to sit through until the very end.Kyoshiro is basically a blend of all of Kaishaku&rsquo;s previous works. It doesn&rsquo;t work to its full potential unless you&rsquo;re familiar enough with all of them to appreciate the references, since it doesn&rsquo;t have much plot of its own. Well, it does, and it does make coherent sense, but it&rsquo;s nothing special....It starts out really confusing, but should be acknowledged for at least answering all the questions and making sense in the end. Very interesting twists midway too. :) Ending was great, and though predictable, it was still sad. Unfortunately, it was all horribly clich&eacute;d, and a complete mess. Whether that&rsquo;s overlookable or not depends on the individual.The characters all play on different fetishes, and the excessive fanservice was beyond an acceptable level of annoying, in my opinion. The main character seems to not have any idea what&rsquo;s going on and speaks to a prince in her head the whole time. I have mixed feelings for Kyoshiro himself. Whenever he does something cool, he just has to go and ruin it by being a complete jerk. Setsuna has to be the character I could most sympathize with. I didn&rsquo;t like her at first, but she grows on you. A lot of them do. And some of them just don&rsquo;t, like Tarlotte.The mecha fights didn&rsquo;t really grab my attention, but they weren&rsquo;t bad either. Just... average, like the rest of it. Mecha themselves look pretty good, and I do think how the Absolute Angels all tie together is quite interesting.Animation is something I can give major points for. The art is really pretty. I&rsquo;m into bright colours, although Kazuya&rsquo;s hair is ridiculous (side note: it reminds me of Shana, and it looked awesome on her, but here it&rsquo;s just way too bright).  Music is average, but it fits, so it&rsquo;s alright.Overall, I&rsquo;d recommend it for anyone who&rsquo;s into any of Kaishaku&rsquo;s stuff (I&rsquo;ve noticed through Kannazuki that they tend to be messy plots, but there&rsquo;s still something charming about them that can&rsquo;t be explained with technicalities&hellip; I guess it really is a matter of taste).

I do not recommend watching this if you really hate yuri/shoujo-ai since there are some scenes with it.Story - Some parts are expected and some are not so you may be bored watching in some parts but glued to the screen in others.

There was also a bit too much fan service from my point of view, but then most anime has far too much fan service.  Overall I liked the characters but I thought Kuu was just really stereotypical and too child like for her age....I also thought in the end Setsuna got the short end of the stick and I felt really bad for her.

Herein this anime; the lesbianism isn\'t so blatant and harsh that the men get stepped on for pure lulz.However, it DOES get heavy-handed on the romance angle. And even though it\'s got 4 or 5 women battling it out using robots they pulled out of their unmentionables, you\'ll start losing your teeth from the over-dramatics and lovey-dovey-ness.Well atleast the guys didn\'t go ""Oh I\'m Gay Now"" in the end. ', 'Kyoshiro was surprisingly good if you are judging based just on the first episode. Yes, it is a mash-up of almost every genre known to man, as well as being a gigantic crossover with all of Kaishaku\'s other works, yet it\'s somehow very watchable. Honestly, I only came to this anime because of Kannazuki no Miko, but I discovered at the end that it was something I really liked. I would even go as far as to call myself a fan (not fangirl, just fan).Story: 6Like Kannazuki, Kyoshiro was a somewhat messy plot. It followed much of the same pattern as KnM too. A totally...discombobulated first episode, a midseries twist, and a heartbreaking, touching ending. Plot is not this anime\'s strong point, but it didn\'t fail completely only because of the ending which totally suckered me.Art: 8I am one of the few who actually likes bright and colorful art. I\'m not sure why, but it just seemed to really go well with the series. Maybe because it\'s a fluffy/guilty pleasure anime but it worked for me. (All except for the fact that a certain evil somebody\'s powers are tinted rainbow).Sound: 7The sound was good enough. The soundtrack fit well, I listen to a few of the songs, like the song that plays while Kuu writes to her prince as the episode opener. Most of the music is just music that fits to the anime and isn\'t really enjoyable to hear otherwise. I watched the dubbed version by Funimation, and frankly I didn\'t mind the actors. I thought Kuu\'s voice actress played the ""angsty teenager"" role very well and I really liked Setsuna\'s voice. I just wish they could have gotten Michelle Ruff for Kaon after her fantastic portrayal of Chikane in KnM.Character: 10I think this is what made the anime compelling at all. Without it\'s interesting, deep and lovable characters, it would have had nothing. Kuu is not my favorite but she\'s bearable. At the end she really gets a lot of character and her final performance just broke my heart. Setsuna was lovely too, with interesting motivations and a strong will. Kyoshiro was a hero who wasn\'t perfect which is extremely refreshing (especially when compared with Souma Oogami). This anime also had a really strong cast of supporting roles, like my favorites, Kaon and Himiko, Soujirou and Tarlotte and the strangely moving Mika. I was definitely impressed with this set of characters.Enjoyment:10Yes, I really did enjoy this anime this much. For me, enjoyment of romance animes depends on how much I cry because of it. With Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora, I cried for nearly an hour, indicating that I really enjoyed it. It will never take the place of KnM for me but it definitely makes it to my top three.Objectively, this is a relatively sloppy anime with potentially annoying characters, no overlying theme, tons of clichés and outrageous amounts of fanservice. But from a sad sap\'s point of view, it\'s a terrifically romantic show that has mechs, magic and angels mixed in for a little spice. discombobulated first episode, a midseries twist, and a heartbreaking, touching ending.

Without it\'s interesting, deep and lovable characters, it would have had nothing. Kuu is not my favorite but she\'s bearable. At the end she really gets a lot of character and her final performance just broke my heart. Setsuna was lovely too, with interesting motivations and a strong will. Kyoshiro was a hero who wasn\'t perfect which is extremely refreshing (especially when compared with Souma Oogami). This anime also had a really strong cast of supporting roles, like my favorites, Kaon and Himiko, Soujirou and Tarlotte and the strangely moving Mika. I was definitely impressed with this set of characters.Enjoyment:10Yes, I really did enjoy this anime this much. For me, enjoyment of romance animes depends on how much I cry because of it. With Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora, I cried for nearly an hour, indicating that I really enjoyed it. It will never take the place of KnM for me but it definitely makes it to my top three.Objectively, this is a relatively sloppy anime with potentially annoying characters, no overlying theme, tons of clichés and outrageous amounts of fanservice. But from a sad sap\'s point of view, it\'s a terrifically romantic show that has mechs, magic and angels mixed in for a little spice.', ""I ended up picking up Shattered Angels because it had some minor connections to Destiny of the Shrine Maiden, which I felt I liked more than most.  However, Shattered Angels has some serious story-telling issues that I really couldn't overlook, despite a decent conclusion.Story & Characters: We start out Shattered Angels with Kuu Shiratori, who is a pretty normal high school student in the city known as Academia.  She frequently has dreams about someone she deems to be her prince, and Kuu feels that its fate that she fall in love with him.  One day, when a new student is added to...her class, she immediately recognizes him as the prince in her dreams.  During her time in school, the school is attacked by Tarlotte, a girl who seems to have the ability to summon the powers of a mech unit.  The new student, Kyoushirou Ayanokouji, rescues her with the help Setsuna, yet another girl who can wield the power of a mysterious mech.  Kyoushirou tells Kuu that she can stay with him and that he'll protect her for as long as she needs.  However, beneath this strange love tale, are much deeper stories that the series seems to hold back from its audience for entirely too long.The story structure is really questionable to me here.  We learn that a select few girls can wield powers that are similar to that of mechs pretty early, and those girls are known as Absolute Angels.  They use mana, essentially magical powers, whenever they fight and are required to kiss their master on the lips to recharge.  They can even summon just a limb, which allows them to fight in tight quarters without expanding their body to enormous sizes.  I like the concept in theory.  However, the series leaves every other interesting piece of story until the final few episodes.  And I mean everything.  The first half of the series focuses around, what the audience would deem to be, senseless fighting.  We just have very little clue as to why there's so much conflict.  I don't hate leaving details until the end, but you need to know why you're going on a certain pathway.Kuu's rather ordinary and does nothing for most of the series than gush a prince that she saw in her dreams.  When Kyoushirou rescues her, it's the only thing on her mind for pretty much half of the series.  She doesn't really do anything remarkable until the end, but even then, her development is minimal at best.  Kyoushirou grades out a little better, but is still pretty unremarkable.  His backstory is actually pretty interesting, but they really don't utilize this as well as I would have liked.  Setsuna might be my favorite in a series.  She's obviously in love with Kyoushirou, but I really enjoyed her outward attitude towards Kuu.  Their interactions were really strong and made the middle of the series a little more bearable.  You can clearly tell that Setsuna is comfortable around Kuu and she doesn't seem to ever hold it against her.One reason I was looking forward to the series was because of the presence of Chikane and Himeko's reincarnations, known as Kaon and Himiko in this series, both of which were initially seen in Destiny of the Shrine Maiden.  The thing here is that there is very little connecting them to their previous selves.  This isn't necessarily a problem on its own, but to barely even have similar personalities bummed me out a little bit.  Kaon ends up not acting much on her own because of the circumstances she was in.  She gets tortured multiple times, and she simply endures it.  You really do feel bad for Himiko for the same reason though - the hand that she was dealt early on wasn't a pretty one.  However, I really like where they took her character after the hardships she and Kaon go through.  Mika is introduced as one of the villains not long into the series and I actually didn't mind some of the writing surrounding her.  She feels that she owns one of the shattered angels and literally doesn't let up on that ideal.  She comes off as very menacing, but her objectives are about as clear as dirt - I really didn't like that portion.  Tartlotte just comes off as annoying and we really didn't get to see what she was thinking in any instance, which bugged me.Shattered Angels eventually flushes out a bunch of details late in the series, but I feel it was delivered way too late.  There were some solid plot points mixed in there, and I actually enjoyed the conclusion a fair bit.  But by the time you get to that point, you almost feel like much of the content that came before it was mostly for nothing.  The fact that we had two pretty bland main characters really didn't help the situation.  (Story: 5/10, Characters: 5/10)Art: This series looked okay for the most part.  I didn't have much of a love for the mech designs here.  The fights were equally okay, mostly because there wasn't much in the way of sustained usage of the Absolute Angels' powers.  Sure, it's an old series, but I'm not entirely sure you can say the quality holds up to today very well.  (6/10)Sound: The sound itself isn't anything special either, with some OST tracks that didn't feel like they fit, and an OP and ED which were unremarkable.  I think this might be one of Josh Grelle's (Kyoushirou) bests work that I've heard.  They're in a lot of Harem roles and I really don't think it's a great fit.  Brittney Karbowski (Kuu) and Maggie Flecknoe (Setsuna) are solid castings for the roles they had.  The somewhat curious decision is to replace Michelle Ruff and Stephanie Sheh with Monica Rial (Kaon) and Luci Christian (Himiko) for the Destiny of the Shrine Maiden couple.  My theory for this decision is that Funimation generally likes using their same people for their licensed series.  Keep in mind that Shattered Angels was licensed by them, where as Destiny of the Shrine Maiden was not.  The reason I believe this, is because the Japanese VAs remained the same for both series.  Rial and Christian are obviously huge names so I'm not too upset by the recast, but I would have loved for Ruff and Sheh to return here.  Much of the rest of the cast were solid in their roles.  (7/10)Overall Enjoyment: Shattered Angels ultimately was let down by both it's slow and questionable story, outside of the ending few episodes, and main two characters that I felt didn't bring enough to the table.  If Destiny of the Shrine Maiden led you here, I can't say I necessarily recommend this show to that same audience.  There are clear similarities, but the relationships here are not nearly as well written.  (5/10) her class, she immediately recognizes him as the prince in her dreams.

Not really much to say in long paragraphs this time around, so I will just condense my thoughts into rating segments.Story: 4/10Everything just felt really generic. If there is one thing I can say about this anime, it's that it never really falls into any form of comedy once. Sure, you have Kuu's enthusiastic friend Kozue, but after Kuu is thrown into the life of Kyoushiro, she turns into a minor character immediately. So the story is mainly just serious half-assed action fights with light drama among it all. The very serious moments did not...really deliver enough passion to feel that way and I'm confident it would be the same experience in either language. I have seen lots of anime, but never one where I was dowsing off well watching. Maybe it is just not meant for me.Art: 6/10The style is colorful and fun, so I can't really give it too much criticism. I like the hair color choice of the protagonist, as I do not often see peach used as a hair color in anime, much less for the main character. She stood out in that regard because of it and it was always pleasant to look at Kuu.Sound: 6/10I liked this one song that played in the early episodes that sounded a bit like a folk song, but I can't seem to remember when it played. Aside from that, most of the songs were pretty forgettable. Some of the piano material sounded nice, though.Character: 5/10Can't say much here that I haven't already said about the story. Kuu, well looking quite nice, is a very generic protagonist and I was not convinced to pay attention to her throughout the entire anime. Kozue, her friend, breathed some life into it, but was immediately thrown out the window after Kuu began seeing Kyoushiro more. I want to say Setsuna breaths the most life out of the main cast you see the most in regards to actual drama since you really feel her pain as she watches Kyoushiro treat Kuu in a way that she always wanted to be treated. It's very sad to watch. Aside from Setsuna, I suppose I enjoyed Tarlotte as well because her voice actor was very fitting of the role and breathed so much life into her character. She was always pleasant to see onscreen, aside from that awkward fish scene.Enjoyment: 6/10I mean, yeah, I said I found it dull earlier. I only rate it above average because I guess the story was consistent enough for me to not hate it. To put it more simply, I would compare it to Bubsy in that you know it's mediocre and respect it for that. And not so much to Sonic Forces where you expected more and were disappointed. Because this anime delivered what it wanted to deliver well enough.Overall: 5/10So, based on my own tastes, I would not recommend Shattered Angels. I just watched it myself because I wanted to try to jump into other genres more than what I usually watch, but this one was just not the one that I should have started that with. It felt mediocre, boring and the story was adequate at most. The action scenes, well, there just aren't enough that feel worthy of this anime being in the Shounen genre. And the story actually felt like it jumped around at times more than it needed to. Maybe the actual source material does it better, but if so, then the anime definitely rushed a lot of things. really deliver enough passion to feel that way and I'm confident it would be the same experience in either language.

Massugu ni Ikou.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1617/Massugu_ni_Ikou,"[""massugu ni ikou is a tiny little series from many years ago that I stumbled across while looking for cute, relaxing things to watch, I wanted a short series  to fill the time between doing other things, and at 4 episodes of only 20 minutes each, this anime totally fit that description.STORY (6/10)the series did have some sort of loose plot, but mostly ambled along at a pleasantly slow pace, focusing on the lighthearted adventures of the main character, a mixed-breed dog named Mametarou and his friends! each episode fits a pretty standard pattern: Mame and friends are curious about something, they end up...having to somehow resolve a problem, usually do so with the help of one of their human friends and a lesson is learned at the end. sort of like mini aesops! throughout the series Mame is worried about his mixed-breed heritage, and how to break this news to his girlfriend, a purebred Kishu, but it's not explored consistently, rather it features as a character quirk before finally being addressed in the last episode.all in all, it's a sweet little story that's simple enough for children to follow, or for an adult to watch whilst multitasking, nothing special on its own!ART (6/10)so I personally would've liked to rate this a lot higher because it's the sort of late 90's-early 00's elegant shoujo art style I really love, but objectively, it's definitely not the best out there. I feel like the colours of the characters were supposed to be 'muted and pastel', but especially for the humans they ended up a little muddy in the end. the dogs were pretty consistently rendered in a very charming and bright way, which is a plus! many animators on shows like this actually struggle drawing dogs, but all of the characters were stylised nicely, and apart from the abundant chibi scenes, were rendered in loving detail (even the nails and pads on each dog were drawn semi-realistically, as well as detailed leashes and collars!), which was super important in this case because so much of this anime is still scenes or scenes with very very limited animation. where massugu ni ikou really shines, in my eyes, is how its scenery is handled. everything is rendered in vibrant watercolour, and it's an absolute joy to watch.SOUND (5/10)in terms of incidental music, there was nothing that really stood out to me, bad or good. the opening theme was a little lacking, with no real catchy or consistent melody, but the ending theme is a lovely, slightly jazzy tune that really fits the pace of the series. the final episode also had an insert song, which was nice for such a short show.CHARACTER (7/10)the characters' roles were pretty simple: provide cute and lighthearted entertainment, and to this end, most characters were simple archetypes applied to dogs. despite this, Mame was still an endearing protagonist, Hanako and her love of melonpan were very sweet, and I found myself genuinely wanting to know more about them and their friends! it's established pretty early on that the human characters are relatively minor, and aside from Mame's master Iku, made to be generic school students, as opposed to the usual shoujo trope of pets bringing their masters together. this isn't something I had a massive problem with since I came to the show wanting cute dog adventures, but if you like all of your characters in a series to be fleshed out, then it might bother you. I gave this section a 7 regardless because I feel like the show doesn't actually set out to do that much with most of its characters in the first place, and having relatively little character development and drama worked very well with its theme of being a slow-paced 'anime for the summer holidays'ENJOYMENT (7/10)as a fan of shoujo, josei, slice of life and similar, I'm a big fan of the idea of 'ma' - the intentionally storyboarded time between important plot points, or significant action by the characters, seen often in the form of real-time scenes of character doing mundane things, pans across beautiful scenery. it gives the audience time to take a breath or two and think about the underlying emotions of a scene. massugu ni ikou is definitely no ma masterpiece, but it does use its slow pace to great effect, and prompts the viewer to just enjoy the beautiful scenery and lightheartedness of the series. this series is far from perfect, but it can make a perfect accompaniment to a lunch break, or cup of tea at the end of a long day.OVERALL (6/10)I completely adored massugu ni ikou, and I highly recommend it for shoujo and josei fans who are looking for something that isn't a massive time commitment. though I've been reviewing it from the perspective of a grown-up fan, I would also consider it a good series for young children who like animals! having to somehow resolve a problem, usually do so with the help of one of their human friends and a lesson is learned at the end. sort of like mini aesops! throughout the series Mame is worried about his mixed-breed heritage, and how to break this news to his girlfriend, a purebred Kishu, but it's not explored consistently, rather it features as a character quirk before finally being addressed in the last episode.all in all, it's a sweet little story that's simple enough for children to follow, or for an adult to watch whilst multitasking, nothing special on its own!ART (6/10)so I personally would've liked to rate this a lot higher because it's the sort of late 90's-early 00's elegant shoujo art style I really love, but objectively, it's definitely not the best out there.

I found every story really beautiful and easy to follow and I was really shocked at how good every...episode ends and wraps everything up.Art 8/10As far as the art is concerned, in my personal opinion it could have been better, considering this is not a really old anime, as it aired in 2000. But then again, the animation kinda fits with the general feeling of this anime and with the characters, hence 8/10Sound 8/10The opening isn't really much to my liking, but it is not horrid. The ending was fine and I liked it.Character 10/10Characters in this anime are the best. :D It is amazing how an anime of just 4 episodes can make the mc - our cross-breed Mametaro develop, especially when I think of many many animes that had a lot of episodes, but no character development at all.

I really didn't find a second of this show boring. And it really warmed my heart as it is so beautiful and cute :3Overall 10/10This is an anime I would want my future child to watch.

Null Peta,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40178/Null_Peta,"[""Welcome to my spoiler-free review of Null PetaThis is a wonderful tale about two sisters and their strong bond! Null and Peta. They lost everything they have when tragedy suddenly struck and tore them apart!! The story has everything from strong love, and humor, to drama. And carrying out its segments extremely well. It's heartwarming and so wholesomeThe style and animation are warm and almost a bit childish with strong colors! It may not have the biggest budget nor the best technique or fancy CGI effects. But it doesn't need to! It reminds me more of a home-cooked meal....Made with love and great care. It has a soul and a big heart. Which makes it so damn appealing and lovable. It's attractive and so fabulously delicious that I just want moreLove the sound everything from the charming beeping noise to the opening.

I had an emotional breakdown watching this show.Story: 10/10This show starts out really really cute and hilarious, at times there is sadness over Null\'s situation and other times there is a slight unease or anxiety about a lurking something. As the show goes on it really builds on these feelings and the ending was handled so well and I cried like a baby.Art: 8/10For a show only a few minutes per episode, it has very solid art and it...changes to accompany the comedic moments and does a really good job of doing so. There are budget limits for such shows so you cannot expect Demon Slayer animation or anything like that, but sometimes that isn\'t the point. I, for one, think that the art of a show is mostly irrelevant to the score.Sound: 8/10The VAs did a brilliant job at their characters and really expressed emotions well throughout the story.Character: 8/10A super-genius child and an overprotective big-breasted mofu-mofu onee-san/ robot. There aren\'t really any other characters and these two, although not so original, are still done so well. The way Null reacts when Peta passes away is quite heart-wrenching and the way she treats her sister when she is a robot really shows how much we take things for granted - she treats her similar to how she would if her sister were still alive, and it really shows when you take that away how much a person can change.Null is pretty cute and is a super-funny super-genius who hates her sister\'s cooking but still loves her more than anything else, which she shows alot throughout the show. She shows great concern for even her robot sister.Peta is such a comforting character. Although, we don\'t see much of her real self, we can tell in her robot self that she really cares for Null and it is making me tear up remembering it.Enjoyment: 10/10If I have not made it clear already then I shall say again that this show is probably the best hour I have spent in my life and I don\'t know if I will ever get to relive it again.Most people will likely get bored and drop the show, or will not think anything other than ""just another short show to pass the time"". With how many tears I shed watching this show, I disagree with these but each to their own.Overall: 10/10Just watch the show, its incredible. changes to accompany the comedic moments and does a really good job of doing so.

In spite of its short length, Null Peta feels just right. Even at about 4 minutes + 1 minute OP, each episode of the show isn't too long and isn't too short. It hits that mark just right and ends just at the point where you want it to end.The plot and humour are done fairly...well, with a very gentle colour palette complementing the scenes really well, giving the whole show a very fairy-tale like presentation that is pleasing on the eyes.And like other weird Fall shows I like (Flip Flappers for instance), the show does end up tackling some fairly morbid themes with a few plot twists here and there, but the upbeat optimism of the show never falters irregardless.Would still preferred if they had the OP at the end of each episode though, having the episode just end without even a fade to black is pretty jarring.7/10 well, with a very gentle colour palette complementing the scenes really well, giving the whole show a very fairy-tale like presentation that is pleasing on the eyes.And like other weird Fall shows I like (Flip Flappers for instance), the show does end up tackling some fairly morbid themes with a few plot twists here and there, but the upbeat optimism of the show never falters irregardless.Would still preferred if they had the OP at the end of each episode though, having the episode just end without even a fade to black is pretty jarring.7/10"", 'You want to see an five minutes anime who gonna surprise you to the begin to the end?

Monster Strike,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30757/Monster_Strike,"['Monster strike is not good show , not at allplease allow me to tell you why (ahhm)first of all the biggest problem i have with this show is the i guess battles of some sort between the monsters , at first it looked like it actually is more of a strategy based combat in which you fling the monster in order to hit your opponent and cause it to reflect back to the opponent as many times as possible dealing as much damage as possible but then i noticed that some monsters can only hit a few times and some had some sort...of a special attack and eventually i realized that its as random as can possibly be. nothing makes sense and i could tolerate that if the animation was a impressive but its as average at its best.The characters are pretty boring and normal the only one that really stands out a little is the little red dragon that is with the protagonist since he is some sort of a prince of the monster world or something (so far nothing was explained)The sound is very basic although the ending is a cover of Queen\'s ""We Will Rock You"" so that was cool but other than that nothing really stands out both positively and negativelyThe only shiny little star i found in this dark sky is the humor of the show , it actually was pretty darn funny especially the moments in which the protagonist breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the cameraAt the end of the day this show is bad , really bad at times so you should probably avoid watching it. of a special attack and eventually i realized that its as random as can possibly be. nothing makes sense and i could tolerate that if the animation was a impressive but its as average at its best.The characters are pretty boring and normal the only one that really stands out a little is the little red dragon that is with the protagonist since he is some sort of a prince of the monster world or something (so far nothing was explained)The sound is very basic although the ending is a cover of Queen\'s ""We Will Rock You"" so that was cool but other than that nothing really stands out both positively and negativelyThe only shiny little star i found in this dark sky is the humor of the show , it actually was pretty darn funny especially the moments in which the protagonist breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the cameraAt the end of the day this show is bad , really bad at times so you should probably avoid watching it.', 'Story:The story is not interesting and almost looks like less inspired version of other pocket monsters game anime in that genre. This may not be as disappointing if you came to this anime through the original game, which had a very flexible premise that could lead to many different designing principles. Seeing them play it safe and take the most standard can be rather insulting. Even by ignoring this, the anime does not represent the game well and gives out false impressions of some mechanics.Art:The design and art style is very similar to the game, which can go from decent to great design. Thanks...to the design and style, it does render 3D models better than other monster based show with CGI like Berserk. However, it does not go far than that and the animation only peaks in fights that does not last long.Sound:The audio department has only two aspects that remotely stands out: The voice actors and ending theme. The voice actors have done a decent job and try to make the character sound less inspired that they already are. The Ending theme is decent, but it’s every rock ending theme you heard. The cover of Queen’s We Will Rock You is not my favourite. Maybe it’s because I’m too fond of the original.Characters:The human cast is underwhelming. Those character that starts interesting lose their touch and those who did not becomes at least entertaining. The only one that I could think up that does not fit in either side is Minami. Minami is the equivalent of the 90s kid who kept shooting out catch phrases and pop culture references in any chance she got. Or in other word, a character that is likely to piss off old anime fans.The monster cast is more interesting and they are probably the reason why you come back to this show.The villains are mostly generic as they come. Nothing more to say about them.Enjoyment:When the focus was on the monster, it was entertaining. When it the focus was on the humans, only some supporting characters could hold entertainment to some degree. The humour was entertaining when it went meta on the first episodes, but it disappeared afterwards.Overall:Monster Strike is a decent anime series that plays as any adaption of a popular social digital game. If you don’t regard the script, execution of said premise, the references, boring soundtrack, the misguided direction, the false impression of the source material, the shallow protagonist and even more shallow antagonist, you find that this is decent enough for you who wants to watch a 10 minutes’ episode anime on YouTube.

A game called ""Monster Strike"" installs itself into Ren\'s smartphone , monsters of the game then literally fly out from his smartphone and start fighting on streets,when he fight he start to pick up his lost memories.

Now then, let\'s get into it!Story: 4/10Middle school student Ren Homura returns to his hometown of Kaminohara where he used to live during his childhood. However he seems to not remember much of his life there unlike his mother and little sister. The day he moves he accidentally breaks his cellphone, after getting it repaired he finds a strange application called ""Monster Strike"" installed in it. This leads to a series of events where Ren and his friends must solve the mystery of his missing memories...and the problems arising in the town.It is mentioned by Ren several times that finding his missing memories is the focus of the show. However it is hardly mentioned at all and rarely seems to have that much of an impact on the overall plot which is rather annoying. I wish the anime actually focused on one thing rather than juggling multiple things such as saving the town from attacks, finding his missing memories and forming a Monster Strike team at the same time. Finding his missing memories seems so important during the earlier episodes but quickly gets sidelined to focus on other things.Art & Animation: 5/10The art isn\'t all that great; I mean what is up with their faces? This is more evident in the later episodes with the human characters\' faces looking so lifeless. Furthermore they pretty much never blink at all which unnerves me.Sound: 6/10There is no opening theme but there is an ending theme; it\'s a cover of Queen\'s ""We Will Rock You"" by Gloria which is pretty good.  The new one that starts at episode 13 however... What the heck did I just listen to?The voice acting itself seems fine with Ren and Oragon being noteworthy.Character: 3/10Ren Homura is a middle school student returning to his hometown but doesn\'t seem to remember his past life there. He seems to have an alter-ego that is an ace at playing Monster Strike.Oragon is a strange monster summoned from Ren\'s phone after Monster Strike is installed.Aoi Mizusawa is Ren\'s classmate and aims to make a successful Monster Strike team with Ren.Akira Kagetsuki is another one of Ren\'s classmates and used to be in a Monster Strike team with Aoi. He seems to be a perfectionist and doesn\'t see Ren as a good player.Minami Wakaba is an airhead who also used to be in a team with Akira and Aoi.Honestly these characters aren\'t very interesting. We hardly know anything about them at this point making it hard to really talk about and describe them.Enjoyment: 4/10Action scenes are rather slow paced and boring while the humour can miss the mark at times. They like breaking the fourth wall at times which as I said  before it\'s ""hit or miss"". It\'s hard to take this anime very seriously.I think one of the biggest complaints I have with the action scenes are the ""bump combos"". Our main characters can seemingly pull off some of these out of their asses because of plot convenience.Overall: 4/10Obviously Monster Strike is aimed at kids and made to advertise the mobile game so I\'ll cut it some slack with my scoring but as an anime this is pretty lackluster so if you\'re looking for any short episode anime to watch I don\'t particularly recommend this to you.

For the first few episodes, you have absolutely no clue what is going on. And it really doesn\'t get much better.First of all, the episodes are only 8 minutes long (though in all reality the episodes are only 6 minutes long. 2 minutes of nonsense). Due to this, there is little time for character development. There is no real story until you hit about episode 12. This anime feels like a mixture between Pokemon, Digimon, and Yugioh, yet the episodes are a 3rd shorter than they should be! (Average is 24 mins long....This really got to me.) The only good thing about short episodes is if you are in a time crunch and only have 10 minutes to watch an episode.The sound is fine, but everything is really dorky. The MC is a dork, and then he fluctuates into a ""strong man"", and back to a dork. He is constantly in his head, which is hard to make a great story.It is a decent anime. I\'m going to finish the other seasons because I\'m a completionist, but I would not recommend this for anyone seeking an OP MC. (This was recommended for me, which is why I say that.) The MC lost all his memories. He remembers somethings when he fights (he actually becomes a completely different character) and then immediately forgets them. There is some fan service that never really gets put into action. The characters hint at naughtiness, but nothing comes from it. (ep 10 or 11. I can\'t remember which one was the coffee shop.)I never played the game itself, which can probably account for my enjoyment of the show.

I don't understand why they didn't just make a 20 minute episode instead of creating a 8 minute episode if they are going to make 51 episodes.
