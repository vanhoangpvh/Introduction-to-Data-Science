Shingeki no Kyojin Picture Drama,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19391/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Picture_Drama,"[""SNK Picture Drama is for you who can't get enough of Attack on Titan and its characters.This show gives you a great opportunity to get to know the characters a little better. The story follows the members of the 104th Trainee Squad during their trainingi, but Levi, Erwin and Hange make short appearences as well.The art is just brilliant! Everyone looks super cute, even the head instructor Keith and the colossal titan.Don't expect any deep story from this show though, because there is none. It's just a silly spin-off that will entertain you when you have nothing better to watch. "", ""I totally recommend this show if you are bored and looking for something light-hearted to cheer you up.Shingeki no Kyojin Picture Drama is a short spin-off series for all SNK fans.It has a simple, silly plotline, yet the ridiculousness brings that weird smirky smile on your face. It is a good miniseries. And not to mention it's extremely cute. All the silly sides of each character are brought out and it's entertaining to see that.You only end up being disappointed if you hope to see something deep from it. This is mainly just for entertainment and gags.Story-6Art-9Sound-7...Character-7Enjoyment-8Overall-7 Character-7Enjoyment-8Overall-7"", 'Every one of these episodes just features some chibi comedy.  No important story elements come from these picture dramas.With that being said, the art is still pretty good.  It\'s not as detailed as the art in the original series, but it\'s still good.  The animation quality isn\'t as good either, but it doesn\'t need to be.The sound effects don\'t really present anything all that great.  The sound was just ok.I like the characters, but I think they acted a little silly here even for it being all comedy episodes.  A bit of the stuff seems slightly out of...character for a few of them, especially things that Armin does in these specials.I kind of enjoyed these episodes, but at the same time, the comedy got old kind of quickly.

This is my first review so please do not expect much from it.I started watching this show as a kind of break from all the sadness and death in the original show and this show did prove helpful as it was full of gags and jokes and just seeing those cute chibi characters made me giggle inside.Story:To start, I didn't expect much from the story as I was just looking for some source of happiness relating to the show. If you are looking for AOT related shows that have a deep story, this is not the one for you. (You should...try some other AOT related ovas such as Lost girls which has a better and more consistent storyline and gives you key knowledge on Annie Leonhart's background.)  This show has a different, basic storyline every episode, almost like a filler episode. Personally, I would rate Shingeki no Kyojin Picture Drama's storyline a 5/10.Art:As you can probably tell already, I am such a big fan of the artwork. The chibi faces are just so cute and the different expressions that correlate to different emotions are just astonishing. However, I must say the quality of the animation was not very good, at least on the website I was using. I would rate Shingeki no Kyojin Picture Drama's art a 8/10.Sound:I don't really have to say much about the sound, It was spectacular and the acting from the voice actors was astounding, as expected from this animation studio. I would rate Shingeki no Kyojin Picture Drama's sound a 10/10.Character:The character's emotions were brought out a lot for this chibi version and showed some characters deep down feelings such as how Hanna felt toward Franz and so on. Personally, I would rate the characters from Shingeki no Kyojin Picture Drama a 9/10.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this spinoff of Shingeki no Kyojin a lot and it cheered me up many times. However, the jokes do get old but the slow introduction of AOT's chibi version of characters made up for that! My enjoyment level would be a 9/10.Overall:To conclude my review, I would first like to say thank you for reading and if you enjoyed please press HELPFUL so I know if I am good enough to write some more reviews :D Overall I found this spinoff very enjoyable, it had its ups and downs but my final score for Shingeki no Kyojin Picture Drama is 8/10!(Remember, this is just my opinion, I hope you have a great day :D) try some other AOT related ovas such as Lost girls which has a better and more consistent storyline and gives you key knowledge on Annie Leonhart's background.)

The first two episodes both have two skits and the rest of the episodes all have three skits. The skits all take place at the training camp and the important characters are the attack on titan cast from around episode 3. The skits sometimes reference events that happened in the main anime but they don\'t add to them in any way.The humour in the skits didn\'t appeal to me and they are somewhat repetitive. For example all skits end with the characters being eaten by the colossal titan which gets boring after 20...times. The characters all act like little kids and in ways that don\'t match their character e.g. you have Reiner crying because he lost his lunch money.While the voice acting was fine, characters also narrated the voice effects being played so you have characters saying things like: ""slide, ""ding"" and ""shock"" all the time. The music is the same as in the main anime but it honestly doesn\'t suit the comedy. The animation is pretty alright as far as chibi animation goes.Overall I don\'t consider this worth watching at all, not matter how much you liked the original anime. The comedy isn\'t funny, the series is repetitive and it detracts more from the anime than it adds. times.

Shinmai Renkinjutsushi no Tenpo Keiei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49849/Shinmai_Renkinjutsushi_no_Tenpo_Keiei,"[""If you're wanting something cute, adventurous, with a slice of intense and sad story put into the mix. Then this is the show for you.Story and characters: 7Management of a Novice Alchemist follows Sarasa who from the start, has had it pretty rough. From having a sweet childhood pretty much ripped away from her, with her only shining light, is following in the footsteps of her parents, in having a shop of her own. To want to become the number one alchemist out there. Something that she'll stop at nothing in order to achieve. It's a sweet and sad coming of age growth story, that...is fun to watch.It honestly reminds me of a usual cute girls, do a particular theme kind of show, but in this case it's adventuring, and mainly centered around one key element in Sarasa becoming the best alchemist that she can be.The cast is filled with a very bright bunch, very lively characters that shine through with their personalities, and make the anime honestly sweeter than it can be at times. Which you'll tend to love if these kinds of shows are for you. You've already got Sarasa,whom she is the sort of character, that you would want to root for, and hope she does well, after the hardships she's had to suffer. Plus her eye swirls are super adorable!Art and sound: 8Honestly is a really big highlight for me. The show really knows how to hit home when it comes to it's production and look of certain things. Using a certain tone when detailed creatures, and the effects they pull off. A massive shoutout goes to how they handled Sarasa during her past. How things may look gloom, but as she's gets further and further to where she wants to go, things seem a lil brighter, which is quite a nice touch. With a good sound portion, to really smack the atmosphere home. It's really well done.Management of a Novice Alchemist won't stand out as a super amazing show, but what it is, is a tale of a sweet journey that'll be sure to be filled with many ups and downs. We can only hope for Sarasa's sake. There are more ups then downs. A good watch for sure! is fun to watch.It honestly reminds me of a usual cute girls, do a particular theme kind of show, but in this case it's adventuring, and mainly centered around one key element in Sarasa becoming the best alchemist that she can be.The cast is filled with a very bright bunch, very lively characters that shine through with their personalities, and make the anime honestly sweeter than it can be at times.

Oh wait...wrong material, we\'re talking about the anime version if there ever was an imitation of it, but in all the good and bad ways possible...which was just a plain ol\' fantasy snoozefest.It\'s almost a given that the SoL a.k.a Slice-of-Life genre can do no wrong, only except that the other genres overshadow it to showcase a bunch of features that ultimately weigh to nothing. And this is such the case for novelist Mizuho Itsuki\'s series that is Shinmai Renkinjutsushi no Tenpo Keiei a.k.a Management of a Novice Alchemist. As one of the many stories under the...Shousetsuka ni Narou a.k.a Syosetu banner, this does feel like a stereotypical adventure-cum-fantasy setting that there\'re so many copycats like it floating around, but how this source material stands out enough to get an anime is just beyond me, because let\'s be honest: this series is just the turn-off-your-brain kind of comfy show, where you need not question the story/plot, but just enjoy as it is: a CGDCT-like (but is not marketed as one) coming-of-age story.Picture yourself as a kid standing between your parents, dreaming of all the things that you want to become when you grow up, all from a sweet childhood memory. And now, enhance that image when all these things are ripped away from you, feeling dejected about what the future holds, only to be picked up by a stranger that teaches you to be his/her apprentice in a craft to help mold your future. This is the female MC Sarasa Feed in a nutshell, under the tutelage of her teacher, the masterclass alchemist Ophelia Millis. Once an orphaned kid, and now on the road to become just like Ophelia, Sarasa works hard to achieve that dream, only to realize that the journey to becoming a masterclass alchemist is not as easy as it seems. With that in mind, Ophelia issues her a tall order: as a graduate from the alchemist academy, the starting point is by opening up shop and establishing a business of her very own. Only except that the shop\'s location is way out of town, and having little resources to work with, the learning lesson is that everyone has to start from somewhere, and Sarasa literally starts from scratch. Oh, did I forget to mention that Sarasa is an OP character? Bet you didn\'t see that coming.For the most part, the show does what you expect: a largely simple slice-of-life show where anything and everything can happen since there\'s essentially no story or plot to begin with (except the MC\'s ""becoming a masterclass alchemist"" part), and that by itself can feel mundane, especially when the characters aren\'t the particularly strong suit to begin with. Sarasa\'s helpers of the young Lorea, along with daughters Iris Lotze and Kate Starven of noble stature are a fun bunch to watch, but while I get this fuzzy feeling of just living life together, as time passes, it changes from fun to pure toleration of the sobering truth that there really isn\'t anything much to the characters either. Most of the ""cast"" are fellow villagers making appearances every now and then amongst the 4 girls and helping them with the alchemist business. And as stereotypical as this is, it just lacks excitement and misses the ""oomph"" factor of what defines a work, though in Mizuho Itsuki\'s case, the novelist is content in staying true to the bread-and-butter ideas of the burn-in of daily life, which is a decent idea, but shows the lack of creativity to spice the source material, leaving it devoid of any staying power. If the show hasn\'t got a word to describe itself, it would be ""standout"".The more I learn about studio ENGI working on series that it was chosen to adapt, it has always been a very inconsistent record of adaptations, from good stories stymied by bad animation or bad stories with just a heck little care put into it, and I would say that the latter is pretty much true about the show. I wasn\'t hoping much from director Hiroshi Ikehata anyways, so this show was certainly a dud in the most average way possible, and not a good one, even though it is enjoyable in spots, provided it\'s constantly like a bait-and-switch in the on-off position. The OST is also average as heck, with Aguri Oonishi\'s OP and Nanaka Suwa\'s ED just sounding kinda repetitive and nice respectively. Both are decent songs though, and nothing more else to add to the roster.There\'re 2 camps for this: the recommendation goes for the light-hearted setting and the calm and collectiveness that it emits, or the mixed reception that aside from the good points of both the show and its source material, there exists a hollow and empty shell to provide more ideas, that weren\'t explored on. As for me, I just found the show mildly enjoyable, that slowly was subjected to boredom. Maybe you have a different experience than I did, and that\'s the subtle diversity of our perceptions.But if there is one certain thing that this show has it going for: the 3-episode rule definitely applies here, and your mileage will vary.

Almost 3/4 of time you watch infantile dialogues and the rest is ultimate walk in the park for mc. Oh and not to forget you know how its named ""Management of a Novice Alchemist""? It has really nothing to do with any management or being novice and its not even about alchemy. Yea you will see some some kind of transmutation circle 2-3 times and some scenes with cauldron but thats...all.""Hey you forgot rate things like animation and music"" - Nah it was mediocre through and through.For me its 3/10 and nothing can convince me otherwise. all.""Hey you forgot rate things like animation and music"" - Nah it was mediocre through and through.For me its 3/10 and nothing can convince me otherwise.', ""8.5-, Wasn't just a moe anime.This anime was quite a mix of things. I was expecting a more moe happy cgdct anime, but right off the bat you get this sad to depressing backstory of Sarasa, which while it fortunately turns around for her and things are great. It continue when as other reviews have mentioned there is a bit of a tonal shift episodes later and continues to happen throughout the anime periodically. You get an interesting mix of things like Slice of Life and Action, Moe and gore/blood, Happy Village and Brutal Capitalist, and way more with a good part revolving around economics...of goods and services. Still it keeps it mostly lighthearted often moving past those feelings to focus on more about the ingredients for alchemy which give it a good introduction to the fantasy elements in this world. Along with having an upbeat village full of happy characters steers you away from realizing initially how kind of shady and a bit bleak this world is.The main part that I see is this anime is it feels more towards adult/dark humor undertones and wouldn't be good if you were looking for only a more lighthearted and moe anime. Sometime Sarasa will say some random comment and it is just unexpectedly more of an adult take that it catches me off guard, sometimes I find those comments pretty funny too. With the discussions of money to jokes to the messages it tries to convey, it feels a bit different than a standard moe blob of a show. It does lack in having a good story flow would be my biggest gripe which to be fair it's a slice of life, so I wasn't expecting much in that regards. But the moments it does have some sort of story it was entertaining it just didn't flow very well in concluding them as there's some loose strings with questions unanswered. The OP was also great has an upbeat energetic vibe to it.Overall, it was fun to watch and I would say actually slightly improves each episode. The few times of action it had was surprisingly good especially the last episodes. In general the art and animation were pretty good backgrounds, characters, and the magic were animated well. Better than I was expecting from ENGI which has had a mix record as a studio. The world is interesting being it's fun to see how the economy and ingredients from monsters for this fantasy world work. I would say this for most people would be a solid average or slightly above anime being it just is such a mix of things, but it does them decently to well. Following the three episode rule would be a good inclination of what the anime has to offer initially, as I do believe it gets slightly better as it progresses once everything has set a foundation. of goods and services.

The few times of action it had was surprisingly good especially the last episodes. In general the art and animation were pretty good backgrounds, characters, and the magic were animated well. Better than I was expecting from ENGI which has had a mix record as a studio. The world is interesting being it's fun to see how the economy and ingredients from monsters for this fantasy world work. I would say this for most people would be a solid average or slightly above anime being it just is such a mix of things, but it does them decently to well. Following the three episode rule would be a good inclination of what the anime has to offer initially, as I do believe it gets slightly better as it progresses once everything has set a foundation."", 'Ah yes another fantasy in this season that i cant count how many are there in this season, But u said there is something that so generic all season right? yea im fine story being generic as long as they know what they are doing? they want do not serious at very first beginning or want to take it serious as the story advance to next level.

It's not surprising that the viewers are beginning to get bored by them. Therefore, these anime are trying to become 'special', in such a way that people do get interested, a way to separate them from the other anime.Recently, fantasy or Isekai anime where the protagonist opens a shop are becoming relatively popular, bringing contrast to the usual action that most have. These shows are mostly cute little shows, letting the viewer enjoy the mundane life of a new store owner. This show, Shinmai Renkinjutsushi no Tenpo Keiei, is one of them.So, did this show...manage to become 'special'? Yes, in terms of concept, and no, in terms of execution. I'm honestly surprised that this anime managed to make a show unique, and clichéd at the same time.Story:There isn't that much story in this anime, after all, it IS a slice-of-life anime, so I won't be too critical on that. The story follows the mundane life of Sarasa Feed, a beginning alchemist who recently opened a store. Having lost her parents to bandits, she is taken in by an orphanage at a young age. Inspired by an alchemist who visited the orphanage, Sarasa decides to become an alchemist, and follow in her parents footsteps. After graduating from the Royal Alchemist Academy, her master, Ophelia Millis, gives Sarasa the opportunity to open a store in a peaceful village, far from the capital. But to her surprise, the building is in a terrible state. After receiving help from the locals, Sarasa's store is finally ready to open for orders. The rest of the story (literally after like 12 minutes) will be about Sarasa Feed running her store (though barely even attending it) with her new best friend, Lorea, an honest girl who decided to help her out with the store, and furthermore accompanied by Iris and Kate, adventurers that help Sarasa gather her materials for her alchemy, while working hard to pay of their debts.The characters of this anime are pretty flat and unoriginal, especially the protagonist, who obviously looks likes she's from Atelier. To add on that, she's OP. Yes, a SOL anime about running an alchemy store, and the protagonist is overpowered? Yeah. The anime doesn't even elaborate on why that is the case, she just is. Lorea isn't as bad as the other characters, neither is Kate. Iris on the other hand, is a stereotypical klutz, always messing things up. She is usually the person that causes the problems. Not to mention that all the characters have a lot of energy, and always seem to be happy and proud. Sure, not that weird for a SOL anime, but when they do get 'down', the situation is very forced, to a degree that you can't even take it seriously.This show is very predictable, filled with clichés, and not funny whatsoever. Of course, the latter is subjective information, but this anime has the objective of making the viewer smile, and that didn't happen to me. Basically every episode has the same layout: they first show a problem, then give a 'plan' on how to handle it, and lastly they deal with it without any problems. It gets predictable, and that's already from the very beginning. As I mentioned before, Sarasa is really overpowered. The anime makes a big deal of certain troubles, but the viewer can already guess that Ms. Protagonist is going to save the day valiantly and everything will be all right. Most anime at least let the main character have trouble, or even fail once, so they will come back stronger and to keep the show interesting, but this anime never does that. Because of that, the fights aren't thrilling at all, nor does the viewer feel hyped up by the combat, because Sarasa is so strong that she finishes every anime in one or two strikes.The last hope, the CGDCT, the SOL, is that good? It's so-so. It has it fair share of problems, but it's probably the best, and most important part of the show. It isn't an action anime, that's already a given. The viewer may find themselves enjoying the conversations between characters, but there are some problems with this as well. As mentioned before, the character designs are bad in terms of appearance and personality, they're overall unoriginal. Most conversations are rather annoying, like for example: for a surprise the side characters exclaim loudly in a 'Eeeeeeeeh?!?!', and for receiving a compliment, it's the usual 'Haha, you flatter me~', dyed with an embarrassed expression. These stereotypical conversations may be very boring if you don't turn off your brain entirely.Now, whether I recommend it or not, I don't say it's a terrible show, it's just that it's not that good compared to other similar shows, like that one of a witch that lived for 300 years, only killing slimes. The former is a good example of what this anime failed to become: a cute slice-of-life anime, with a slight 'action' subtext, whereas this anime was inconsistent in that perspective. I recommend to only watch this if you are certain that you can enjoy this, because this show is not entertaining for everyone.TL;DR: This is a flawed show that can be perceived as boring and predictable, and only ever enjoyable if you turn your brain off.

We have a premise, where young girl had a situation in a life, had a lucky encounter, had strong innate ability and then everything got served on a silver plate. We pretty much got a cute girl managing a alchemy store on a country side with cute girls, creating cool stuff with sometimes cool logic and we have the whole alchemy fiasco. Material gathering, magic infusion, making stuff and so on. Whilst just chilling around, talking, doing nothing and occasionally having few challenges. I mean it’s nothing serious, it’s just relaxing, fun and enjoyable to watch.Only gripe I have is that although the alchemy aspect itself is pretty fun when they actually focus on that, at some points it feels they kinda forget about the alchemy aspect and get lazy about it. But when they actually show early on and at some later episodes the alchemy element, it’s actually pretty fun. Gets me into mood to play one of atelier games.CharacterWe have cute and cheery cast, with few more mature side character stereotypes. But for the most part it’s a bright group of friends enjoying their daily lives at alchemy store. Growth is pretty much them getting closer and we learning a bit about their past and them growing a bit better managing their store and giving ideas to thrive better.

Not bad nor amazingly good, it is just good enough for the genre and the contents of the show. Didn’t feel like it needed particularly “better” anything. But I did quite like the sound design.

Inoffensive, mediocre *sigh* light novel anime like this are a dim a dozen these days, and whilst some of them are poorly written, animated crudely or accidentally indorse slavery in some way, Management of a Novice Alchemist is just a show about a cute girl and her cute friends doing cute, fantasy world things whilst running a fantasy world shop.Just to clarify, whilst it’s writing is on the whole inoffensive, it’s art and animation can use some work. It looks like every other half baked light novel adaptation despite is poor lighting, shading and awful...line art which only highlight the genericness of the supporting casts character designs. Sometimes the animation will randomly crank it up to 11 during an action scene, but overall it’s very unimpressive.I also believe that the alchemy Sarasa practices isn’t really alchemy at all. She just uses magic, but calls it alchemy in the show?… I don’t know, it’s a weird nitpick I couldn’t look past.This all isn’t to say that I didn’t enjoy my time with the show. I like core quartet of Sarasa, Lorea, Iris and Kate. They don’t exactly fit into your standard moé blob archetypes (expect Iris who is the -meathead, act-first-ask-questions-later, eats a lot and chokes on food- type) and watching Sarasa grow her business is on the whole, enjoyable if you like that sort of thing. However, fantasy light novel, moé blob shenanigans does eventually wear thin if you don’t have the art, animation, music and interesting personalities to back it all up. It also doesn’t help that Sarasa is grossly over powered, meaning any enemies or obstacles that get in her way will be dealt with swiftly by the end of the episode no matter her threatening to herself, the village or her friends it may be.If you’re looking for a good moé blob show to watch and brighten up your day… then you can find much better ones than this. May I suggest Lycoris Recoil, Bocchi the Rock, Do It Yourself, Encouragement of Climb, or maybe even Endro?

There\'s monsters, gatherers/hunters, and a MC who is spectacularly good at fighting. It certainly can be called generic, as many elements do not stand out. This seems to be one of those anime that serves as a relaxing relief to the other more intense anime this season.Story (6):Initially, the story was fine. We get a setting and background of the MC [Sarasa] who is going out on her own in the countryside. However, with the airing of the third episode, I felt a subtle tone shift in...story telling. The first two episodes were nice and relaxed with decent character interactions. However, the third one was less relaxed and more tense, which is inconsistent with the other two.I did not read the source material, but the pacing and tone feels off to me, and it remains to be seen if this type of storytelling will become dull.Art (6): The art is nothing special; typical fast production-style art. I think the art for the character feels ""cleaner""; the edges/outlines of the characters doesn\'t feel ""jagged"", for the lack of better words. So it is better in that sense.Character (6): So far, no real character development has taken place, which is as expected. However, I feel as though there is a bit too much talking from the MC. It could be from the choice of the voice actor making the MC sound sort of mechanic and tedious. So far, nothing stands out to me. Even the character interactions of the ""main party"" is currently stiff, and hopefully that changes.Audio/Music (6): The only reason why audio/music is a 6 is because of the MC\'s voice acting. Otherwise it would be a 7. Good OST, OP, and ED.Enjoyment/Overall (6): I did enjoy watching the first three episodes. If you are someone who do not like generic, adventure-fantasy world settings, this is not for you (probably most people). The story feels like it has potential to get duller. The characters currently do not have development and their interactions do not feel ""welcoming""; not at bonding stage yet. Sarasa\'s voice acting leaves a lot to be desired, as it sounds monotone (she has a lot of lines... can there be less speaking and more world building). story telling.

If you are looking for a palate cleanser or a mindless show to watch, there are better ones out there that are actually worth your time.My gripes with the anime- The sad backstory was just a means to get her to open a shop. When you think things through, it is sad for the sake of being sad, and she decided to open a shop because their parents had a shop. It is not clear what really motivated her to become an alchemist. does she want to save people, does she want to become rich? What is...the connection between the death of parents and alchemy?- OP MC. Again, if done right it is quite entertaining to watch. But tell me why the village living in the edge of the forest, which has a good sect of gatherers, are so poorly informed about the monsters that surround them? They should know this place like the back of their hand and yet, it has to be the MC that has to tell them. How does this make any sense? This is a lazy attempt to bring spotlight on MC.- When one of the character is injured and comes for treatment, the issue of cost comes up. Ok, the alchemist needs to be paid for her service, cool. But then again, the whole village practically offered their services for free as a welcoming gift. It makes me think that the MC is inconsiderate and petty. Yes items are expensive and she needs to make a living, there is a conversation that needs to happen. But there are so many better ways to do this without making the MC look petty and then copping out latter by having the MC reveal that she'd have offered her services for free anyways.- MC is OP because she can alchemy. Is magic innate to people or alchemy. Can others use magic or only alchemist? If alchemy allows you to be strong, why aren't there more fighters pursuing alchemy? How does the MC master the sword and physical enhancement in one day?Personally I cannot stand when MC is OP because the anime actively dumbs down all the supporting characters to the level of potatoes. the connection between the death of parents and alchemy?- OP MC.

Tanken Driland,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14333/Tanken_Driland,"[""Tanken Driland the anime that thinks its a JRPG. From the ugly cute monsters to the treasure hunting to the power of friendship, it has a lot of the cliches of a JRPG, and that is not necessary a bad thing.The story.In the world of Driland people known as Hunters search monster infested ruins and dungeons for treasure. The protagonist princess Mikoto is influenced by a legendary hunter named Bonny and decides to become a hunter as well. After being told no she runs away and becomes hunter anyways. Mikoto's attendant Wallens joins her but to try and bring her back home. They are...joined on their journey by Pollan a hunter who want to be a hero and Paan a wondering Knight. There are also hints of some great evil coming to the world and that Mikoto and her companions will have to fight it.The Art.All of the characters are animated in chibi style. That is they have big heads and small bodies. The monsters would not be out of place in Dragon Quest.The Sound.The voice acting is pretty good, each character sounds unique and it conveys their personalities very well. The opening theme is alright but I personally love the ending theme.The Characters.First we have rebellious princess Mikoto. Instead of sitting around and waiting to come of age to rule the kingdom of Elua, she is learning how to use a sword and sneaking out of the castle to learn how to be a hunter from Bonny. She is a bit naive and stubborn but she is also a genuinely caring person.Next is Wallens, Mikoto's attendant, he has a mysterious past and changes the subject whenever someone asks him about it. He is also a powerful fighter able to take on monsters much larger than he is using only his fists.The third character is Pollan the kid of the group. He wants to be hero like the ones in the stories he has grown up on. His weapon of choice is a rifle. Personality wise, he is pretty dumb and falls for some obvious traps but he doesn't like to see people suffer and tries to help when he can.The fourth character Paan has not appeared yet.Enjoyment.Do I enjoy the show, yes. I like JRPGs, especially the Final Fantasy series and Breath of Fire games, so my opinion maybe a little bias but I like dungeon crawling for treasure and battling monsters.Overall.Tanken Driland is a light hearted adventure story that fallows standard JRPG formulas.

Shamanic Princess,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1182/Shamanic_Princess,"[""Such an amazing anime packed into 6 episodes. Short, but oh so sweet.The story is admittedly confusing, but not to the point that it becomes a distraction. You'll most likely have to watch it again just to make sense of it all. Basically, an artifact of great power was stolen from the Guardian World, a magical realm. This artifact, known as the Throne of Yord (even though it's a painting) has captured the sister of its thief. A Guardian named Tiara has been charged with the Throne's retrieval, only to find out that another Guardian is already on the job.The art...good lord, the art....I have never seen a better looking anime. Ever. I'll say it again for emphasis: this is the best looking anime i have ever seen in my life. The town is a quaint European village that had me searching on google to see if a place like that actually exists so I can move there immediately. The architecture is amazing. Everything about it feels refreshing. I never thought that I could feel refreshed from watching an anime, but I swear the air feels cleaner while watching it. You can almost smell the flowers. The character design is equally amazing.I really liked the opening and ending themes. Both are quite catchy.Character development is surprisingly deep for a 6 episode anime. The last two episodes are prequels that make up the bulk of the development by letting us know how it all started. The lead, Tiara, can be quite catty, but never crosses the line into annoyingness. She's also quite badass. There are exactly zero useless or annoying characters which is very rare for an anime of this genre.It's a 6 episode anime that i can watch again and again. The art quality is legendary. I loved the story even if it was confusing at first. The characters are all very interesting and you want to know more about them.Shamanic Princess gets a solid 10 from me. The best part about it is that I got the entire series on a single DVD for a mere 10 bucks! A rare find indeed, but that makes it even more worth it. Of course most people who read this will be downloading it, but in the name of all that is good in the world, download away! It will make your favorites list.

A true classic from the 90's!"", ""A fun exploration of extremity in style. Tiara and Lena are two magical girls sent from the Guardian World to retrieve the Throne of Yord, inside of which their friend Sara is trapped. The plot is there, it's convoluted, and it's nowhere near the most important thing. It's not afraid to be mysterious - the Throne is simultaneously a painting, a setting, and, later, a character with spoken dialogue. The details of the girls' powers, which seem to be grounded in contracts with beings of the underworld, are never explicated in detail, and are instead allowed to exist as mysteries.The real draw here is...the visual themes. I'm not explicitly saying you should watch this high, but I don't think it would detract from much. Shamanic Princess constantly confronts the ways feminine visual archetypes can be read as restrictions and limits. Tiara's highly athletic and sexualized design contrasts with Lena's stillness and chastity, especially in action sequences; the designs are exploitative and ridiculously horny, but they faithfully reflect the madonna-whore dilemma of feminine presentation. Interestingly, Tiara is the protagonist, and one of the only characters given an interior life. The most memorable sequences are the characters' ventures into the Throne of Yord, sometimes magically and sometimes in dreams; Sara is shown there in pastel colors lounging placidly by a river, beautiful and free, yet hopelessly imprisoned. Tiara and Lena's battle transformations are eruptions of the monstrous; they lend them power, though no permanent liberation. The visuals are also just a great case study of 90s extremity in design; I really enjoy that style. You might not.The soundtrack is easy to miss, but it's tasteful and covers an ambitiously wide range of styles and genres.It's important to know that the show's plot, which is already difficult to follow, wraps up in Episode 4, with the final two episodes dedicated to broader worldbuilding.

I’m not going to say that I’m disappointed, but more just underwhelmed with it. That’s not saying that it’s bad by any stretch, but the series overall could have been much better with a few minor changes.This 6 episode OVA follows Tiara, a special agent from the Guardian World, the home of mages, who has been sent to earth disguised as an ordinary high school student to recover the stolen Throne of Yord,...a powerful mystical object which is the source of magic energy in the Guardian World. During her hunt for the Throne of Yord, she discovers that it has a terrible secret when some of her friends and colleagues from the Guardian World fight to keep her from retrieving it.This series has a lot going for it. It has good animation and art, a decent premise, a great soundtrack by Yoshikazu Suo that is appropriately moody and fits the series well, and has an darker atmosphere and themes that could drag you in if it’s something that especially appeals to you. But as I mentioned earlier, it does have a few problems that just prevent it from being a great series instead of just being an OK one.For some reason, the first four episodes of this series seem to really rush through it’s plot. As if either the series didn’t have the budget or time to properly flesh it out. One scene goes to another without any real transition and doesn’t really give any breathing room, making the pacing of the show just feel off. By the time you’ve realized what’s going on, you’re already half way through the scene. There is even a plot point early on where out main character goes to a human high school to fit in as to not arouse suspicion that goes nowhere. It’s probably why those first four episodes are so confusing and hard to keep track of at first, it’s too busy rushing through it’s own story. Maybe the series could have done with at least one other episode just to give the series a better pace.My biggest problem with this series are the last two episodes. Those last two episodes contain all of the character development and establishing plot points that lead up to the first four episodes of the series. Which begs the question, why are these last two episodes not the first two episodes? These two episodes feel like they were moved around just so the series could have some sort of twist at the end. If the people behind this series wanted to tell something out of order, they could have had these two episodes be flashbacks placed at certain points throughout the series. At least that way, it would have given the rest of the series a better pace, and it still could have lead up to some sort of “twist” if that’s what the creators wanted.Shamanic Princess isn’t a bad series by any stretch, but the idea to have the last two episodes be where they are really drags down the series as a whole, making it more confusing than it needs to be, and the series as a whole would have been much better if they were located somewhere else.

Pretty much, Tiara, a princess, is ordered to retrieve the throne of Yord. So, based on that, the story sounds great, it\'s just badly pieced together. Like there were events that I understood that led to the story, but then there are other events where I was asking myself ""Wait, what does that have to do with the story"". Also, like I said, the story itself is confusing. You really have to piece together the story for yourself. Like, figure it out on your own.I\'ll admit, it has some cool action scenes that tend to make...up for the bad storytelling.Also, the main story pretty much ends at the fourth episode. The last two episodes are like flashbacks to the past.

There were some scenes that were badly done, which bothered me, but for a 90s OVA, art isn\'t all bad.Sound 7/10So the soundtrack isn\'t bad. I really didn\'t like the openings though, but the music for the events and fight scenes, I quite enjoyed.Character 4/10So you have a bland protagonist, Tiara. I mean,, she wasn\'t interesting at all, but they did a good job explaining her past. I gave character 4/10 because they were all bland, despite that they all had character development, but I just didn\'t find myself interested in the characters and to me, the characters were boring. But the story does make up a bit for the bad characters.Enjoyment 6/10My enjoyment level of this anime is mixed. I found myself enjoying the fight scenes and once I somehow pieced the story together, it made it a bit understandable. But, I don\'t want to have to piece a story together. Like, when you go into a anime, you should understand what the story is without having to piece it together.Overall 6/10I mean, it\'s not all bad. If you don\'t mind having to piece together the story, then this anime may not all be bad for you. Honestly, I enjoyed the anime for the action scenes and for some of the story, but I can\'t really say it was a good experience or bad experience.

Teekyuu 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32228/Teekyuu_7,"[""Here's a short and pointless review, but Teekyuu is also short and pointless so it should fit.It hurts to try to follow along with Teekyuu, let alone think about it on any critical level. The jokes fly by at supersonic speeds and the actual quality of the humor fluctuates dramatically on a second-by-second basis. Having watched through all 7 seasons of Teekyuu thus far, I've learned to just accept it for what it is, but to make it this far you'll have to train your brain to turn itself off, and your mileage may vary depending on how much condensed randomness you can physically...absorb.That said, this season was probably the most consistent of them all so far - I was able to enjoy every episode on some level, and some of the best moments of the entire series happened this season. Currently I haven't heard anything about an 8th season being announced, but if it gets made, you can bet I'll be watching it. Teekyuu is the kind of anime that I can't drop any more, I've invested too much of my mental well-being into this series to back out now.I recommend that everyone at least watch one episode of Teekyuu, preferably from this season because like I said, it's the most consistently enjoyable one so far. You'll know right away if you will be able to watch any more of it, but it might take some time before you know if you like it or not.Upon further reflection, it might not be that Teekyuu is improving, but rather that it has broken me completely by this point. As this is actually quite likely, please disregard everything I've said up until this point. 10/10 absorb.That said, this season was probably the most consistent of them all so far - I was able to enjoy every episode on some level, and some of the best moments of the entire series happened this season.

So far four episodes in and I can't stop thinking about how much fun each of the episodes have been. I want to go back each time and re-watch them to catch all the stuff I missed. Really a brilliant surprise to find this little gem of a series. All the English voice cast are back and I can tell had a lot of fun making these.

Strike Witches 501 Butai Hasshin Shimasu is one of these comedy spin-off, a parody of Strike Witches. The force of this type of comedy is that the viewers already are used to the original characters and know their traits.The anime use what we expect in order to make fun of every character in a certain way by exaggerating each...characters and their interactions, and creating absurd situation.But sometime this sort of comedy can suffer from multiple problems that this anime avoid very successfully:- The jokes can be overused very quickly and thus become boring.

I couldn't think of a better art style for this anime and I'm very proud of this choice, it is very refreshing.Strike Witches 501 Butai Hassin Shimasu is for me, a perfect example of a parody done right, and I'd watch more anytime soon.

However, although that does sound like its a problem, it is not. In terms of story, you won\'t be getting one, but that\'s okay, because honestly, this anime, despite of what it lacks, it\'s worth it.Clocking in at a total of 12 episodes, each with a length of about 12 to 13 minutes, each episode has something fun to...see. There really is nothing about this anime that I can spoil to you, as really this is just the whole idea of ""cute girls doing cute things"". You get the main cast, same one from the original anime back in 2008, and the same location, aka their ""base of operations"", aka home. Each episode has something fun and engaging, watching your most favorite characters getting hurt, doing stupid stuff, getting in trouble, you name it!The artwork is something special. Seeing the artwork, you know, straight up, its low budget, but for some reason, and somehow, the low budget makes it better. The lack of movements and facial expressions are simply replaced with static images of themselves, and walking animations are just simply the entire character sprite moving up and down in a way fashion. Even though there seems to be a sort of laziness to it, they add that anyways, because somehow, it makes you smile or even laugh.The characters don\'t really need much of a description here, as it is the same cast as of the 2008 series. If you have never seen any Strike Witches media, excluding Brave Witches, you can still watch this and it could still make you smile, but there really isn\'t much in terms of development. This was made for returning fans of the franchise, and for that, they don\'t really need to delve deep into the lore. Trust me, watch the other anime first, then hop into this. I know this is a spin-off, but it won\'t feel right if you just hop in with no knowledge of the World Witches Series.I enjoyed this well enough to the point of completing. Each episode is fun and engaging, and it\'s really great to see some of your most favorite characters pop in out of nowhere, do something stupid, only to get beat up off-screen by Barkhorn, and have a Warner Bros.-esque bump on the head, only to have them talk about the main lead in the background, with only text instead of speaking/dialogue.Overall, give this a watch if you are a good fan of the series. If you want a story, this isn\'t for you. There are some ecchi bits here and there, but unlike the original series, there\'s no nudity or constant panty shots.Enjoy! see.

Telepathy Shoujo Ran,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3668/Telepathy_Shoujo_Ran,"[""Telepathy Shoujo Ran is a series that had intrigued me for a while but I had always made excuses not to start it.  Because of my interest in it, I did come in with a certain level of expectation and while it certainly is on a whole a pretty solid show the ride was a bit uneven.The overall story in Telepathy is both the best and worst part of the series.  While there really isn’t an overriding plot, the general theme is pretty interesting and in many ways unique from most anime of this kind.  The story centers on Ran, a seemingly...normal middle school student who suddenly finds herself able to read minds and possessing other strange powers.  In a turn that is a bit different from most series, the plot focuses more on the feelings of fear and isolation of being different from everyone else and how people's impressions of you would change if they found out.  While the story is generally light-hearted and upbeat, this theme permeates the entire anime and is the basis for most of the stories.  At times the drama is pretty intense, particularly when it comes to Ran's friend Midori who shares her powers.  The conflict between the two of them and the development of their characters (particularly Midori) as the series progresses is without a doubt the best part of the entire show.However it’s not all good.  As I mentioned, the series is uneven and that is due mostly to the story.  While the beginning portions of the show are extremely interesting as well as portions later on that have to do with Midori's character development, too much of it feels a bit too much like mindless fluffy filler.  Many of the stories are monster/freak of the week fare and the only thing that makes them interesting at all is Midori's antics.  Though of all the series faults the one that annoyed me the most was the eco-rant and violence in the last story arc of the series.  While I have no problem with message stories, this came across as a lecture and really was inappropriate.  Though the overall ending seemed to tie things together, I really hate feeling like I am being preached to.By far, the characters make this series worth watching.  As a lead, Ran is pretty typical.  She is an earnest and idealistic girl we are used to seeing in anime.  She is a bit vanilla but despite that she is going to be the one most people will be able to relate to.  Shockingly she is surprisingly normal (despite her telepathic powers) and unlike a lot of anime characters she actually has a normal home life free of perverted brothers and fathers or dead or missing parents completely.  It's kind of a shame that I seem to have to point out normalcy when it actually occurs in anime given how rare normal is.  But I think it’s refreshing to see a family like this instead of using it for cheap laughs or tired drama plot devices.Midori however really steals the show overall.  While she starts off as a villainess her growing friendship with Ran and their personality conflicts really sets her apart.  Her personality could best be described as a closet tsundere.  While she puts up a facade of being the demure and elegant rich girl while in reality she is a crabby, foul mouthed glutton.  Her crush on Ran's older brother Rin is also quite amusing.  However it is the deep emotional scars under the surface and the development of her character over the series that really sets her apart.  Midori's experiences is in many ways is what Ran herself feared the most.  The rejection of Midori by her mother when she found out about her powers shaped her whole outlook on life but through her friendship with Ran and helping others she is able to come to grips with her powers and her mother.Rui rounds out the rest of the main cast.  He is also the least interesting to me.  He is your typical effeminate anime male who mostly comes across as an emotionless robot.  I suppose you could call him Ran's boyfriend and while you can certainly tell that he cares and likes Ran a lot there is little change in how he appears to feel about anything really from the first episode to the last.The supporting cast is pretty solid.  Ran's family is refreshingly normal but because of this they aren’t particularly interesting either nor do they really appear much either.  The only exception would be her brother Rin, who has the most screen time.  They provide bits of levity and comic relief, though perhaps ultimately end up rehabilitating Midori the most from her emotional scars.  Since a lot of the stories are a bit standalone most characters appear once and don’t return again.Artistically, Telepathy is good though not spectacular.  The characters are suitably proportioned for their age groups and realistic.  That being said it does feel a bit plain and bland.  This is not really a bad thing, as I kind of liked the more down to earth and realistic style but given how flashy a lot of series are some people may find it visually dull.  Vocalist Chara does an excellent performance with the OP to the anime which I felt fit the show wonderfully.  The ending is less spectacular.  Overall the voice acting is solid and there is little to complain about, or compliment either for that matter.I find myself feeling both rewarded and disappointed with this show in the end.  I think it had potential to be much better but at the same time it is never bad either.  The repetitive stories and environmental raving at the end is a definite negative however this is offset by the great leading cast.  It’s a pretty safe series in that it is unlikely to be hated by anyone but equally unlikely to be loved either. normal middle school student who suddenly finds herself able to read minds and possessing other strange powers.

I have to admit that I was rather surprised by Telepathy Shoujo Ran, as I expected something along the lines of Mokke or Mushishi, and instead I was immersed in a supernatural anime version of Scooby Doo (minus the annoying dog - thankfully!).Telepathy Shoujo Ran started life as a series of light novels by Asano Atsuko that were collectively entitled Telepath Shoujo Ran Jiken Note (or Telepthathy Girl Ran Incident Notes). The series was popular enough for a manga adaptation to be made by Ida Toshitsugu which were serialized in Shounen Sirius magazine. The manga was well received by audiences, which encouraged the...production of a 26 episode anime series which was by NHK.The anime version of Telpathy Shoujo Ran is essentially a slice of life, supernatural cum mystery series. The story begins with Isozaki Ran, a young girl who has just begun junior high school. She is a rather upbeat and energetic girl who is a member of the track and field club, and is in love with her childhood friend Ayase Rui. One day she suddenly hears a voice which simply says &quot;Found You!&quot;, and it's from here that her adventures begin.The owner of the voice is Naha Midori, a girl the same age as Ran, who transfers to Ran and Rui's school as she wishes to test Ran's powers. Midori is very clearly hostile towards Ran and Rui, and pretty much everyone else, at the start of the show, but she is pulled along by events in the same way that Ran is until the two become firm friends.The series is actually rather well animated, and the characters are designed to be individuals rather than posessing a generic face and body (unlike so many other shows). The scenery is very well envisioned, as are the various dreamscapes and ethereal planes that appear in the show. A nice touch that was added to the anime was the ability to distinguish whether Ran or Midori was in a heightened emotional state by the change in their aura when using their powers.Sound for the series was also well done, epsecially Midori's attempts to hide her usage of Kanji in everyday conversation. The VAs did rather well with their respective characters, and managed to make them sound like individuals on the whole.The OP is a nice mellow J-rock track sung by a breathy voiced songstress (if anyone knows the name of the song then let me know). The ED is a more typical J-rock ballad featuring Rui running along a beach towards Ran.On the whole, the characters in the anime were rather well done. The main characters of Ran, Rui and Midori, along with Ran's older brother Rin to a certain degree, form the core of all of the stories in the series. There is a certain amount of development given to both Ran and Midori, as they are the two most omportant characters, however I felt that both Rui and Rin needed more development by the end of the show, especially given the fact that Rui seems to act exactly the same as he did when the show begins. Rin is a bigger case for development, especially as Midori has a major crush on him. There were numerous occasions where I wondered why they didn't show him actually being aware of her feelings (which are blatantly obvious by the way her personality changes whenever he's around). Both Rui and Rin needed a few more episodes to flesh out their characters, and it would have been nice if there were more episodes that explored Rui's power and it's uses.That said, I did like both Ran and Midori on the whole. I found the constant arguing between the two to be a nice change of pace to the typical &quot;friends forever&quot; scenarios, and add this to the fact that Ran and Midori had two very different childhoods and you have a formula for some good character growth. Ran is very obviously the &quot;golden girl&quot; - always nice, polite, kind, etc, whilst Midori is very much dysfunctional because of her childhood. The show makes a great play about the differences between the two, especially during the first few episodes with Momoko.I was actually surprised by how much I did enjoy this series, and I'd recommend it to fans of Mokke, or quasi-supernatural romance shows like Air, Gift ~Eternal Rainbow~, Wind - A Breath of the Heart, Kanon, etc, although Telepathy Shoujo Ran has more mystery and less romance.The thing that I was most surprised by whilst watching this show though, was the number of times I expected to see Scooby Doo make an appearance, and how often I expected to hear &quot;And I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you pesky kids!&quot; production of a 26 episode anime series which was by NHK.The anime version of Telpathy Shoujo Ran is essentially a slice of life, supernatural cum mystery series.

There is a certain amount of development given to both Ran and Midori, as they are the two most omportant characters, however I felt that both Rui and Rin needed more development by the end of the show, especially given the fact that Rui seems to act exactly the same as he did when the show begins. Rin is a bigger case for development, especially as Midori has a major crush on him. There were numerous occasions where I wondered why they didn't show him actually being aware of her feelings (which are blatantly obvious by the way her personality changes whenever he's around). Both Rui and Rin needed a few more episodes to flesh out their characters, and it would have been nice if there were more episodes that explored Rui's power and it's uses.That said, I did like both Ran and Midori on the whole. I found the constant arguing between the two to be a nice change of pace to the typical &quot;friends forever&quot; scenarios, and add this to the fact that Ran and Midori had two very different childhoods and you have a formula for some good character growth. Ran is very obviously the &quot;golden girl&quot; - always nice, polite, kind, etc, whilst Midori is very much dysfunctional because of her childhood. The show makes a great play about the differences between the two, especially during the first few episodes with Momoko.I was actually surprised by how much I did enjoy this series, and I'd recommend it to fans of Mokke, or quasi-supernatural romance shows like Air, Gift ~Eternal Rainbow~, Wind - A Breath of the Heart, Kanon, etc, although Telepathy Shoujo Ran has more mystery and less romance.The thing that I was most surprised by whilst watching this show though, was the number of times I expected to see Scooby Doo make an appearance, and how often I expected to hear &quot;And I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you pesky kids!&quot;"", ""This is an entirely watchable anime.  That's why I'm watching it.  My enthusiasm is fading slightly as the show goes on.The cute heroine looks like the heroine of Ghost Hunt, and she's psychic, and she goes on adventures not unlike the adventures from Ghost Hunt.Mostly the show reminds me that I would have liked Ghost Hunt more if it had featured more psionic stuff.Obviously, the show includes telepathy.  Additionally it has some unrealistic telekinesis, ghosts, some non-human spirits, etc.   The paranormal elements seem more realistic than some of the plot contrivances.I love the characters.  That doesn't mean they're very...well-written or well-directed.  The character Naha Midori is perhaps the most interesting character, but she is pretty maladjusted, and somehow her conflicting emotions don't get portrayed convincingly.  One minute she's secretive and sinister, the next minute she's aggressive and aggravating, the next minute she's into some entirely new pose.  Yes, maladjusted people can be mercurial like that, but it feels forced.  This is a shame, because the other characters are pretty two-dimensional.I've been known to enjoy some shows that were intended for young girls, such as &quot;Ultra Maniac,&quot; and some shows with appeal for young viewers of both sexes.  Heck, I even watched more &quot;Sugar Sugar Rune&quot; than I care to admit.  So far, &quot;Telepathy Shoujo Ran&quot; doesn't have the style and polish that sets some shows apart.  I'm hoping that it gets better. well-written or well-directed.

There's nothing most people would find offensive about it, even for their children to watch.  In fact, what it is, is the perfect  anime for young girls before they are ready for young adult material, but after they are children.  I'm no expert in defining what age watches or reads what these days, so I am not going to give specific ages.  The basis of my opinion is that it has...two cute girls (not the moe cute type, the real girl cute type); a genial, somewhat nerdy older brother, who is not a great catch in the looks department but is very nice; and a male friend who is cute as someone in the junior high age range is, in the same way that the girls are cute.  There are many comedic moments, and the main story is that of discovering that there are other people that will accept the person you are, even if you were rejected in the past.  The individual episodes or story arcs are occult or horror mysteries, not terribly gruesome, but just like a ghost story kids will tell at a slumber party or around a campfire to amuse each other.  There are even hints of romance among the main characters, without much overt demonstration of it.  The general mood is one of light-heartedness, with the reminder that there are serious issues to be confronted in growing up.The opening and closing animations are very attractive to young girls just discovering hanging out with friends, going shopping, or trying on clothes; the closing sequence is a bit romantic.  The musical styles of the opening and closing songs are a bit unusual but have a more modern and original pop style than is usually seen in anime.

Some of the stories involve ghosts, murders, myths, animals, etc. There is a diversity of mysteries that aren't very predictable. I would rank it higher except it was pretty repetitive. Almost every episode (some of them were a bit longer lasting 2-3 eps) was them solving some form of mystery one way or another. There was obviously character building and interactions as well but yeah. Also the ending two...episodes got pretty wacky. I won't go into detail but I think they should've just ended it on a more casual note with the same pace and stakes as the rest of the anime but instead they wanted to go out with a bang and created this enormous situation that seemed way to grand and out of place. Still had a cute ending though.Art: Basic. Nothing bad or great about it really. The quality was consistent and there was no 'same face syndrome' which is all I ask for in an anime to be honest. The character designs were good too and it is nice to have an anime that doesn't give crazy hair and eye colors. But there were no scenes that were absolutely gorgeous or anything like that.Sound: I liked having a main character with a kansai accent- that is not very common. The voice acting was good, though Rui really didn't have many changes in the pitch of his voice. I wouldn't be able to differentiate his serious voice from his happy voice etc. But he was a pretty mellow character so it might've been done one purpose.

Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2580/Tsukuyomi__Moon_Phase_Special,"[""One of things that bothered me about Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase was the mood. When a show opens with Neko Mimi Mode, an incredibly silly and lighthearted song with such silly animation, along with all the falling basins added for comedy effect, you wouldn't expect the dark atmosphere the show had. What makes this special enjoyable is that from the outright, it lets the viewer know that it's not meant to be taken seriously. For me, it was a pleasant way to end the series after the awkwardly dark tone of the main series.Story 9/10.You want a story? The Tsukuyomi cast is lost at sea in...their house, the Marumi, which somehow became able to float. Why? Because. That's why. It's obvious that this show has thrown out the plot and is just being plain silly. Aside from Hazuki and Art solidifying their sisterly relationship even further, this special doesn't really provide much for the Tsukuyomi universe.Art  7/10. Sound 6/10.Having seen a few SHAFT works already, I already knew what kind of things to expect artwise. It's nice to see that Shinbo and SHAFT still had their surrealism even in their early days. Other than that, I didn't particularly care for the art and sound one way or the other.Character 9/10.It's nice to see the cast of Tsukuyomi when they aren't fighting THE FORCES OF EVIL as they're quite funny and likable. The best characterization in this special is the breakdown of Seiij: He is the sole voice of reason when everyone is carrying on their daily lives as if being stuck on a floating house in the middle of the sea is nothing. Other than that, it's nice to see what I thought was the best part of Tsukuyomi remain mostly unchanged where as some other comedy specials throw out the main personalities of the characters in an attempt for comedic effect.Enjoyment 9/10.Mileage will vary on this one. Those who found the dark and brooding mood of Tsukuyomi to be one of its best part will be disappointed. Those who enjoy a good laugh, such as I, will find this special to be quite enjoyable. It doesn't take itself seriously for the most part and will keep on finding ways for the viewer to wonder what the hell just happened. From Grandpa's experience with Octopus, to Anzai's surprise appearance, to the battleship full of Vigos, this special will keep you cracking up.Overall 8/10.At the end of the day, all this special will be is just a silly thing to laugh at. It provides nothing new or substantial in relation to the main plot of Tsukuyomi. Those who found the end of the series to be unsatisfying won't find what they're looking for in this special.

Tenshi no 3P!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34177/Tenshi_no_3P,"['Is it already the year 2017 and you still haven\'t converted to the church of lolicon yet? That is very unfortunate, but maybe this anime will manage to enlighten you. At least it did a good job of reminding me of why I became one in the first place.Tenshi no 3P is more or less the spiritual sequel to Ro-Kyu-Bu, coming from the same author and adapted by the same animation studio. So if you\'ve seen that show, you can consider that a rough baseline on what to expect here too, merely that instead of loli basketball we here have a loli rock band. However,...it must also be stated that Tenshi no 3P is generally a bit more serious and wholesome than RKB was, but on the flipside it has less ecchi elements instead. As for whether that\'s a good or a bad thing... well that\'s up to you to decide.The story mainly follows three orphaned elementary school girls, ostracized from their school classmates and living inside a church. In an attempt at spreading some joy both for themselves and for the local kids, they decide to form a band and then host a concert for them. In order to do so, they seek the help of the anime\'s high schooler protagonist Nukui Kyou—an independent music producer they found on the internet who lives nearby—and asks him to become their manager and help them fulfill their modest dreams.Now it should be said that while the show is clearly made for lolicons primarily, it\'s not like it\'s totally unwatchable even if you aren\'t one because content-wise Tenshi no 3P actually has mostly more wholesome key plot elements in it. For one, the music is a rather central theme over the course of the story, and while it doesn\'t exactly go into detail about how the girls\' are improving on a technical level, there is at least a respectable amount of effort put into the musical department of the anime, with numerous live performances and songs done by the main seiyuu cast. I guess you could argue that the girls are perhaps a bit *too* good at it considering their ages, but well that\'s anime for you. Mind you though, this is *not* an idol anime by any means; the girls are not trying to become professional musicians at all. This is only a small scale spare time project of theirs. We also have a decent amount of drama and characterization in the form of these girls\' rather miserable life situations as orphans and outcasts in their school, and there are some genuinely touching moments every here and there. I especially find the rather noble intentions behind the girls\' musical ambitions to be rather heartwarming. There are also some secondary characters introduced over the course of the anime who add some additional perspective on the strange relationship between Kyou and the kids and end up influencing the story in various ways as time goes on.That said, even though there are numerous more serious merits to the show, in order to get the full intended experience of Tenshi no 3P then I think you pretty much have to be a lolicon in the end. Take my word for it: if you\'re not feeling some sort of subconscious desire to split Jun in two and attempt to make babies with her half the time she\'s on screen then you\'re missing out on about half the potential enjoyment value of this anime. Not to mention the dominant and sexually aggressive HanaKana loli Kiriyume that is introduced in the latter part of the show; I\'d lick her toes any day of the week. It\'s definitely not as lewd as Ro-Kyu-Bu was and in general it does have a more serious atmosphere, but in the end the show\'s main selling point naturally lies with its lolis, especially the main trio consisting of Jun, Sora and Nozomi. They are rather different from each other with Jun being the ultra-moe poster girl, Sora being the comic relief character and Nozomi being the more vocal and emotional of the trio, so they balance each other out quite nicely as a group. Amongst the side lolis we also have the MC\'s jealous little sister Kurumi (who unfortunately doesn\'t get as much screen time as she probably deserved) as well as the rather forceful aforementioned Kiriyume who they end up meeting in the second half of the anime. To add a bit of variety there are also a pair of non-lolis involved in the form of the MC\'s childhood friend Sakura and Kiriyume\'s caretaker Yuzuha, the latter of which is supposedly an elementary schooler too but she looks way older than that so I\'m not sure what that\'s about. So that makes seven girls in total, but as for whether that makes it a harem or not is a bit debatable since it\'s pretty unclear what kind of feelings the little girls really have for Kyou considering that they\'re still prepubescent (they probably don\'t understand what love is yet). Either way, their general depiction is leaning more towards moe than ecchi though—which is another difference from Ro-Kyu-Bu I think—as while there certainly are some occasional shots with a lot of underage skin showing (like bathroom scenes), for the most part the girls are presented as more cute and adorable than alluring. Most of the ""lewd"" scenes of Tenshi no 3P basically just consist of sexual innuendos in the form of some intentionally ero-sounding dialogue which in reality describes something totally innocent (you probably know what I\'m talking about, it\'s a pretty common narrative trick in romcoms and stuff), usually as the opening scene of an episode.This pattern does admittedly change a bit towards the end of the show (episodes 10 and 11 to be exact) as then the more serious arc that was ongoing has just ended and apparently they decided to round that out the anime with being a bit more light-hearted and harem-like than the rest of the show, and it does have more ecchi elements in it. However, considering that this show was ultimately made for lolicons primarily, I can\'t say this was a very unexpected development, nor did I mind it at all. It\'s difficult to say whether or not that means that the anime would\'ve been better as a whole if the rest of the show had been more ecchi-oriented as well or not, but I\'m fairly happy with what we got so I won\'t think too much about it. That being said I still certainly hope we\'ll see some doujins of these girls in the future. The last episode does provide a quite satisfying finale though.All-in-all I would probably still say that Ro-Kyu-Bu was a bit better than Tenshi no 3P but this is still something I would wholeheartedly recommend to other lolicons or people who just like moe girls in slice of life shows in general (as the show doesn\'t really have much ecchi other than the last few episodes). Unfortunately anything remotely loli-themed is bound to get slammed by prejudiced and narrow-minded westerners for no other reason than that ""it\'s creepy"" so I\'m sure there\'ll be a bunch of clueless statements thrown around in some places, but hopefully people will be sensible enough to not pay them too much heed. But at least the show is obscure enough to be able to dodge most of the obligatory hate bandwagon, so maybe not all hope is lost. it must also be stated that Tenshi no 3P is generally a bit more serious and wholesome than RKB was, but on the flipside it has less ecchi elements instead. As for whether that\'s a good or a bad thing... well that\'s up to you to decide.The story mainly follows three orphaned elementary school girls, ostracized from their school classmates and living inside a church. In an attempt at spreading some joy both for themselves and for the local kids, they decide to form a band and then host a concert for them. In order to do so, they seek the help of the anime\'s high schooler protagonist Nukui Kyou—an independent music producer they found on the internet who lives nearby—and asks him to become their manager and help them fulfill their modest dreams.Now it should be said that while the show is clearly made for lolicons primarily, it\'s not like it\'s totally unwatchable even if you aren\'t one because content-wise Tenshi no 3P actually has mostly more wholesome key plot elements in it. For one, the music is a rather central theme over the course of the story, and while it doesn\'t exactly go into detail about how the girls\' are improving on a technical level, there is at least a respectable amount of effort put into the musical department of the anime, with numerous live performances and songs done by the main seiyuu cast. I guess you could argue that the girls are perhaps a bit *too* good at it considering their ages, but well that\'s anime for you. Mind you though, this is *not* an idol anime by any means; the girls are not trying to become professional musicians at all. This is only a small scale spare time project of theirs. We also have a decent amount of drama and characterization in the form of these girls\' rather miserable life situations as orphans and outcasts in their school, and there are some genuinely touching moments every here and there. I especially find the rather noble intentions behind the girls\' musical ambitions to be rather heartwarming. There are also some secondary characters introduced over the course of the anime who add some additional perspective on the strange relationship between Kyou and the kids and end up influencing the story in various ways as time goes on.That said, even though there are numerous more serious merits to the show, in order to get the full intended experience of Tenshi no 3P then I think you pretty much have to be a lolicon in the end. Take my word for it: if you\'re not feeling some sort of subconscious desire to split Jun in two and attempt to make babies with her half the time she\'s on screen then you\'re missing out on about half the potential enjoyment value of this anime. Not to mention the dominant and sexually aggressive HanaKana loli Kiriyume that is introduced in the latter part of the show; I\'d lick her toes any day of the week.

Not only because of the gay score of 6.72 but also its unpopularity with just almost 19k users who completed the show. This show is basically the meaning of a ""hidden gem"", I would never have found this masterpiece even by sorting top anime by score rating or popularity if it wasn\'t for that loli moments video I found on youtube.This show overwhelmed me several times. I expected a big mature man at the meeting place but it turns out to be 3 kawaii lolis instead, I expected Kiriyume to be a normal woman but she...turns out to be a loli instead, I expected this show to have 1 loli but I got a loli harem with 5 lolis in it instead.(OMG that\'s so rare, normally a loli show is already rare enough [which contains like only 1 loli character] But this show has 5 lolis! 5x enjoyment; buy 1 get 4 free). Moreover, this show has a reasonable amount of loli fanservice scenes and each of them is very HD quality.Story 10/10:I don\'t see a reason to hate this show, even if the watcher is not a lolicon. The plot is very unique and I enjoyed the story itself excluding the lolis.Art 10/10:All lolis character designs are very kawaii and HD as expected from a studio experienced in making quality loli shows.Sound 11/10:Needless to say, the sound is the main focal point of the show. I never skipped the OP and the EDs, the OSTs are also very good, I remember imagining this moment when I write about how good the sounds are when I certain OST came in the background during the show. But most of all, I like the band\'s song especially the SAY HOWLING! song, the climax is very catchy, in fact, I\'m still hearing it right now while writing this review.Character 10/10:Every loli has their own personality especially the main 3 lolis, the shy and clumsy one, the brave but sleepy one, and the tsundere and mature one. They are all very unique which altogether makes the show very interesting when the MC takes different loli routes experiencing a different mood from the other ones which are pretty amazing for the writer to be able to create up to 5 unique loli characters as they may be hard to make, right? (Shakugan no Shana, Hidan no Aria and Toradora all have the same loli personality) Which may also explain why there are not many loli harem shows.Enjoyment 10/10:I really enjoyed the show and I\'m very sad that the journey has ended so quickly without any sequels or even OVAs to follow up. That last recap scene at the end was very nostalgic and tragic, they don\'t have the Sora god special moment at the end of the show too. Very sad to see the show left me so suddenly.Overall 10/10:This show and Ryuuou no Oshigoto! makes me want to watch other loli shows by this studio as well and of course, I\'m also looking forward to the ((hent of this show. turns out to be a loli instead, I expected this show to have 1 loli but I got a loli harem with 5 lolis in it instead.(OMG that\'s so rare, normally a loli show is already rare enough [which contains like only 1 loli character] But this show has 5 lolis! 5x enjoyment; buy 1 get 4 free).

This is actually my first and maybe only review on Mal so dont hate me if this doesnt sound professional like other people.This is going to have some spoilers to explain the main plot of ep 1-4 and also the reasons as to why i dropped it.I started this show thinking I'd drop it in a heartbeat on ep 1. However with the first sum of minutes I was highly entertained and interested with the mc, It was later revealed that he...had anxiety so after a certain incident happened in his middle school he became a hikikomori and stayed home all day. According to him the only person he truly talks to is his little sister. At home he makes music alone but he receives a message from a fan asking if they would want to meat. The message sounded as if it was from an older gentleman but later told it was a little grade schooler asking him for help in a band with her friends. They drag him to their home and he does agree to become their manager so they try to get people in the orphanage they are at to hold a farewell party cause the place is going to be sold. That's all well and nice but the real main problem with this show is the intended audience. I'm not going to yell at all the lolicons that love this, cause I like lolis myself (not to a high degree). To put it simply these are the main points of the show:Good Points:- The setting is interesting having a high schooler that deals with anxiety.- Not only the mc but the main girls also have their own problems with their own lives and arent making friends for some reason.- When the show plays from the original setting it is gripping and gets you fully entertained.- The music played in the show isnt that bad and a music geek might have fun watching.Bad Points:- They keep lewding the characters when it's not needed to do so seeing as how they have quite the interesting setting.- Each episode ends or begins with lewding the main girls.- After a few eps the main girls actually become rather annoying.- At this point in the story all the interesting points of the story are over now.- The show will most likely move on just lewding all the girls now that they dont have a story to work with.There were probably more reasons but due to it being so long I've seen an ep I cant even remember the OP or ED at allI'm not going to continue the show based on the fact that the show can only get worse from here on out. Both the things I personally were interested in for this anime ended so I really have no reason to continue it any longer.Anyone can go in and enjoy the show as they please, I wont see anything bad by it. I just see this show as one of the disappointments of anime that come out every now and then. *cough cough* Kotoura-san *cough cough* had anxiety so after a certain incident happened in his middle school he became a hikikomori and stayed home all day.

It has a cute design, the animation is decent--not the best, but I liked it enough--and I really liked the music. There's only one thing that made me hate this enough to drop it.....Story: 4/10A teenage hikkikomori with musical talent has accepted the task of helping three orphan girls hold a concert at the church by the end of May. A decent plot. There isn't too much going on, it's simple enough to understand what the main goal is for the series.I don't really hate anything about this portion of the show. Again, it isn't the...best, but it's not the worst. It's decent.....Art: 7/10I liked the design of everything! I thought the girls were very cute, though I just thought it was weird how they were the only ones dressed in such fancy/lolita clothes. Then again, they are little girls.Animation was better than other shows I've seen this season. I would've given it a higher scoring if it was just a little more refined.....Sound: 8/10It was great. I like the kind of music they were playing in this show, though I do love most genres of music.They made each song fit well to the scene, and I really have little to no problems, here.....Character: 3/10This was my main problem.The characters are textbook, and are nothing but that one trait.You have the hikkikomori teenage boy. He doesn't leave his home often, stays in his room, refuses to go to school because of his social anxiety, and plays music as his outlet. That's the only difference he has to other characters like him.Then there's his little sister, a tsundere that gets salty when her Onii-Chan(TM) talks to another girl and not her. Just... why? It's so overused and boring.You have the three orphan girls.Jun, a shy, girly, extremely high-pitched girl that will cry at the drop of a hat. Her voice is akin to nails on a chalkboard. I just couldn't like her outside of her character design.Sora, a quiet, emotionless girl that's always sleepy. She is a mirror of Shiro from No Game No Life, personality wise. Er, her lack thereof.And finally, Nozomi. A tsundere. That's it.They are just bland, to me, annoying, honestly.....Overall: 5/10The fanservice was just obnoxious. I love panty shots and perverted/comedic context as much as the next guy, but I just have a problem with it when it comes to elementary school girls. That, and it was just so often, I couldn't go five minutes without some kind of fanservice!I was really liking this show while watching episode one. I was tolerating Jun's voice, which was, at the time, the worst thing about the show so far. Then at the end, they ruined it.I just can't get used to the fanservice, and Jun's voice just gets more and more annoying.I might give it another chance when all 12 episodes are out, but I doubt it. best, but it's not the worst.

I would say it doesn\'t have as much loli fanservice as you might expect. It\'s ratio of loli fanservice to loli moe is somewhere between GochiUsa and Dragon Maid.I\'ll check out the no-fanservice edit and report back.Story:The show is adorable, although a bit formulaic. The first half of the first episode...is focused on what led our MC to become a music-obsessed high-school NEET, including subtle encounters with two clearly soon-to-be main characters.From then on we hit straight into the story arc introducing the loli band, their immediate motivations, and two side characters including the suspicious characters from the first episode.Then there\'s a story arc bringing the MC and the other 5 characters together, with a drama arc instead of a concert arc this time. A romance subplot is introduced for the most appropriate character.The drama overflows into the next 3 episode story arc about introducing 2 new lolis and their tragic backstory, but this time it\'s a concert arc. The romance subplot becomes a joke harem.Finally we get a 3 episode battle of the bands arc between the 3 loli band, and the remaining 3 lolis. The newest loli band loses, but there\'s no sense of closure as they say that it\'s only the beginning, and the romance subplot fails to even come up.It\'s formulaic and arc driven story combined with a huge ""read the source material or pray for Season 2 as you buy Japanese Blu-Rays"" ending, knocked off a few points for me. But it was a serviceable story with it\'s heartstring moments. And it was more than enough to bring out the loli moe characters we\'re all clearly here to see.Sound:Sound was great, loved all the rock tracks. A bit lazy with the editing at times, but the soundtrack was phenomenal for a loli-rock band show. The amateur aspects sounded amateur enough to be convincing. I really enjoyed one character\'s increasingly terrible piano practice.Art:The art in this show is good, but I wouldn\'t say it\'s fantastic. You can tell it was drawn rather cheaply, but they have great character design so the moe comes through when it needs to. I\'d love to see what the blu-ray brings to the table, but I don\'t want to be put on any more lists.Characters:The characters are all adorable and all get sufficiently enough backstory and explanation to make them believable. Which is a pretty high bar in CGDCT territory. Obviously, not as much time per character for development is available compared to other CGDCT anime, due to this show having a plot, but you\'re not left wondering what a certain character would do in any given scene.Enjoyment:I got a lot of great enjoyment out of the series, it was bright, cute, happy, and fun. The entire ride was comfy, but with enough bumps that it wasn\'t boring. I feel like they nailed the sweet spot for a balance in:fanservice / moeCGDCT/haremplot/slice-of-lifedrama/comedyas well as tone and having great versions of a whopping 6 different types of loli waifus. The ""main"" girl is also pretty great.Overall:Overall, I\'d say this show delivered a lot more than I expected it would. I\'d say it\'s a CGDCT show with just enough plot and romantic spice to keep you from sinking into complacency. Also, it\'s about a band, they play music pretty often. You get to see an animated 3 piece loli band play music pretty often.If that\'s not worth a 9, I don\'t know what is.EDIT: The source material is a light novel released in 2012, along with a manga adaptation that started in 2014. Neither is translated by an official source, or a fan scanlator. If you don\'t want to be blueballed by an inability to finish the story, learn Japanese or don\'t watch the show. If you just want 5 hours of cute moe lolis in a band, regardless of story, go on ahead. is focused on what led our MC to become a music-obsessed high-school NEET, including subtle encounters with two clearly soon-to-be main characters.From then on we hit straight into the story arc introducing the loli band, their immediate motivations, and two side characters including the suspicious characters from the first episode.Then there\'s a story arc bringing the MC and the other 5 characters together, with a drama arc instead of a concert arc this time. A romance subplot is introduced for the most appropriate character.The drama overflows into the next 3 episode story arc about introducing 2 new lolis and their tragic backstory, but this time it\'s a concert arc. The romance subplot becomes a joke harem.Finally we get a 3 episode battle of the bands arc between the 3 loli band, and the remaining 3 lolis. The newest loli band loses, but there\'s no sense of closure as they say that it\'s only the beginning, and the romance subplot fails to even come up.It\'s formulaic and arc driven story combined with a huge ""read the source material or pray for Season 2 as you buy Japanese Blu-Rays"" ending, knocked off a few points for me. But it was a serviceable story with it\'s heartstring moments. And it was more than enough to bring out the loli moe characters we\'re all clearly here to see.Sound:Sound was great, loved all the rock tracks. A bit lazy with the editing at times, but the soundtrack was phenomenal for a loli-rock band show. The amateur aspects sounded amateur enough to be convincing. I really enjoyed one character\'s increasingly terrible piano practice.Art:The art in this show is good, but I wouldn\'t say it\'s fantastic. You can tell it was drawn rather cheaply, but they have great character design so the moe comes through when it needs to. I\'d love to see what the blu-ray brings to the table, but I don\'t want to be put on any more lists.Characters:The characters are all adorable and all get sufficiently enough backstory and explanation to make them believable. Which is a pretty high bar in CGDCT territory. Obviously, not as much time per character for development is available compared to other CGDCT anime, due to this show having a plot, but you\'re not left wondering what a certain character would do in any given scene.Enjoyment:I got a lot of great enjoyment out of the series, it was bright, cute, happy, and fun. The entire ride was comfy, but with enough bumps that it wasn\'t boring. I feel like they nailed the sweet spot for a balance in:fanservice / moeCGDCT/haremplot/slice-of-lifedrama/comedyas well as tone and having great versions of a whopping 6 different types of loli waifus. The ""main"" girl is also pretty great.Overall:Overall, I\'d say this show delivered a lot more than I expected it would. I\'d say it\'s a CGDCT show with just enough plot and romantic spice to keep you from sinking into complacency. Also, it\'s about a band, they play music pretty often.

I think its worth watching even if you dont like music anime, there were a lot cute scenes and the angels trio were cute as heavenly.I would never have thought a show rated 6.72 (when i wrote this review) will be this good, there were some time when i thought its a bit slow but nah it was gucci overall.The ending was really sweet i wish there was a season 2, I\'d like of this was...more romantic (Kyou x Sakura) but i think this will do. I was planning this anime from a long time, damn i should have seen this a lot earlier.Voice actress ""Oono Yuuko"" who had done voice acting of ""jun gotou"" voice actress ""Koga Aoi"" who had done voice acting of ""Sora Kaneshiro"" and voice actress ""Itou, Kanae"" who had done ""Sakura Toriumi"" these voice actress made the show masterpiece other voice actress were good too ""Endou, Yurika"" was also the best in this show. Specifically these all actress made the show wonderful and i became fan of Oono Yuuko her was was perfect for the character ""Jun""Everyone needs to watch this anime its really sweet.

Truthfully, it gave me the heebie-jeebies, especially when there started to be more and more uncomfortable ecchi scenes. But, I gave it chance again, shortly after I became a fan of ""Rō-Kyū-Bu!"" — which is by the same writer, Sagu Aoyama, and their stories are always a ray of light through a cracked window sill of ethical obscurity.⚠️ This review of Tenshi no 3P! will be spoiler-free ⚠️—Story/CharactersAs I mentioned earlier, the framing of the premise...in the beginning of the series seems... pedophilic, but when Kyō\'s doting friend from school (""Sakura Toriumi"") starts to help him look after the girls... it seems less like a potentially manipulative situation and more like a couple taking care of children. It reminded me of the situation in ""Elfen Lied"" — where Kōta and Yuka take care of the mentally incapacitated ""Nyu"", and they begin to fall in love while looking after her! The situation is even more averted from the initial weirdness, because Kyō Nukui is like many other harem protagonists and will get flustered by a moment of sudden intimacy, but is too shy and kind-hearted to act on anything!Kyō Nukui is a high school drop-out, turned shut-in, who is more or less an unstated VOCALOID composer — going under the handle of ""HibikiP""! Jūn Goto, an orphaned young girl, sends him a private message and asks him to help write compositions for her band, so that their orphanage doesn\'t get shut down. Yes, it\'s like every season of ""Love Live!""... but, with children instead of teenagers! It is then revealed that his childhood friend, that is in the same grade as him, is also an orphan and grew up in the same chapel as the young girls! Naturally she joins in their effort to preserve the building, partially because of her feelings of nostalgia and her budding relationship with the trio, and also, because it\'s clear that she has a crush on Kyō! I call it ""childhood friend syndrome""! If you didn\'t know already, it\'s a chronic condition in anime!There are various conflicts along the way, Nozomi (the bassist), almost gets adopted by her biological grandfather in England and is torn on whether to move or stay with her friends; Kyō\'s closest online friend also invites the girls to perform on a resort island, but there is more behind the request then they originally think! Despite all of the twists and turns, the girls all stick together and Kyō\'s harem grows, after the introduction of two new characters (Kyō\'s younger sister can also be considered a part of the harem, but I try not to think about that too deeply...) and thus, the romantic comedy hijinks ensue!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Shinsuke Yanagi (director), notable works:* Chōjin Kōkōsei-tachi wa Isekai demo Yoyū de Ikinuku you desu!

As I mentioned before, I am a fan of the ""Rō-Kyū-Bu!"" franchise, but Keizō Kusakawa\'s adaptation of the first season was far better than the second season, directed by the aforementioned Shinsuke Yanagi. I would say that ""Tenshi no 3P!"" has been his best creation, since his directorial debut (that I HAVE SEEN). A very fair-to-middling director, but he gets the job done!Good Seiyū Work = ✅Really Enjoyed the Seiyū\'s Performance = ✅✅One of Luna\'s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅✅✅Yūki Inōe as Kyō Nukui, notable roles:* A106, Atom: The Beginning ✅Commentary: I haven\'t heard any of Mr. Inōe, I only listened to him as A106 briefly in the one or two episodes that I saw of ""Atom: The Beginning""! His voice isn\'t the most distinctive, but it functions fine with many of the first-person perspective camera angles that we\'re seeing the story through. His demeanor is that of an eroge protagonist, but it works well with the story that the author was trying to tell. Great job!Yūko Ōno as Jun Gotō, notable roles:* Nemesis, Infinite Dendrogram ✅* Yuzu, Konohana Kitan ✅✅✅* Aya Asagiri, Mahō Shōjo Site ✅✅* Hiyo Yukino, Ongaku Shōjo (TV)* Jeanna D\'Arc, Ulysses: Jeanne d\'Arc and the Alchemist Knight ✅✅✅Commentary: Ms. Ōno is a fairly new talent in the industry, but I freakin\' love her voice! I thought she was amazing in ""Konohana Kitan"", ""Mahō Shōjo Site"", and ""Ulysses: Jeanne d\'Arc and the Alchemist Knight""! Aside from Sakura being a top pick for best girl, Ms. Ōno\'s performance as Jun Gotō was very charming and, for me, she was easily the most likable out of the main trio! Incredible performance, and I hope that Yūko Ōno keeps getting more roles as cute girls!Yurika Endō as Nozomi Momijidani, notable roles:* Asuna Kangoshi, Anime de Wakaru Shinryōnaika (""Comical Psychosomatic Medicine"")* Lisa Imai, BanG Dream ✅ — role reprised by Yuki Nakashima* Haruno Yoshikawa, Diamond no Ace (series)* Windom, Kaijū Girls: Ultra Kaijū Gijinka Keikaku ✅* Rina Sakai, Sakura TrickCommentary: It\'s hard to create a comparison between Ms. Endō\'s other roles and this one, because I\'m so accustomed to Lisa Imai\'s ""new"" voice, that\'s it\'s difficult to remember how she sounded before the switch! Regardless, while she is the least memorable girl out of the main three, Ms. Endō still makes Nozomi intensely likable! Great work!Aoi Koga as Sora Kaneshiro, notable roles:* Kaguya Shinomiya, Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunōsen ✅✅✅* Hanabi, Mahō Shōjo? Naria☆Girls* Yuri Miyata, Two CarCommentary: Most recently, Ms. Koga\'s most famous role is Paimon in the mobile game, ""Genshin Impact""! With that being said, Ms. Koga has such an adorable voice, I love her as Paimon and Kaguya\'s character is the most enjoyable part (FOR ME personally) in the ""Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai"" series! Sorry, Chika! A blossoming young talent in the industry, I hope that Aoi Koga can land more hit roles! Amazing work!Commentary: Ms. Itō is one of my favorite voice actresses of all time, and she does a perfect job at making the tsundere, childhood friend a compassionate and headstrong girl. I would compare her performance as Sakura Toriumi to her roles as Nana Astar Deviluke (""To LOVEる"") and Airi (""Queen\'s Blade"")... it\'s funny because Sakura is a twin-tailed character and her seiyū voices Airi, who is considered to be one of the most iconic twin-tailed characters of all time! Amazing performance, as always — Ms. Itō has such a strong presence and a beautiful voice!Commentary: Another seiyū that I love! Ms. Hidaka has a wonderful voice! Kurumi, Kyō\'s little sister, was the dark horse best girl of the show, because she was so enigmatic, snarky, and talented! I would compare her role in ""Tenshi no 3P!"" to her performances in ""Tamako Market"" (""Anko Kitashirakawa"" is in my list of the top ten best little sisters of all time), ""Inu x Boku SS"", and ""Show By Rock!!"" — Ms. Hidaka the mastery of cute, moe performances perfected! Fantastic job, as always!Commentary: Everyone knows who Kana Hanazawa is, but in this production she plays a lonely loli with a tragic life. There is no one better that they could have been chosen for the role, Ms. Hanazawa completely nails it! I would compare her performance as Kōme Ogi to her roles voicing Tomoka Minato (""Rō-Kyū-Bu!"") and Ruri Gokō (""Ore no Imōto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai""). Extraordinary work, as always!Commentary: Yuzuha probably has the smallest presence out of the girls, but she was still a very memorable character! Upon seeing her design, I get a fuzzy feeling, a feeling of warm nostalgia! Ms. Iguchi has that effect on me, I can recall feeling that way about her roles as Miku Kohinata (""Senki Zesshō Symphogear"") and Mako Reizei (""Girls und Panzer""), too! Marvelous performance!If you have a zero tolerance policy towards younger characters being featured in a number of ecchi scenes, then this is not the anime for you. Despite the series being a soul-stirring experience (even though ""Rō-Kyū-Bu!"" had a slightly better adaptation), there are still some questionable scenes. Though, luckily, Kyō Nukui has the same affliction as Tenchi Masaki in ""Tenchi Muyō!"" — where he\'ll blush or get flustered, but is too kind-hearted or shy to make an advance on anyone, even girls his own age! I enjoyed the splash of adorable, platonically pure moments and the girls\' friendships with each other were nice to experience second-hand. I rate Tenshi no 3P! a 6/10, and suggest it to anyone who isn\'t too weirded out by the fanservice!Rating: ★★★☆☆ in the beginning of the series seems... pedophilic, but when Kyō\'s doting friend from school (""Sakura Toriumi"") starts to help him look after the girls... it seems less like a potentially manipulative situation and more like a couple taking care of children.

It\'s not very entertaining, but you will like it if you are a fan of the slice of life genre. It has the potential to give a heartwarming atmosphere and it is very relaxing to just sit back and watch. That is how I watched this anime.This is also a show about music, so if you are interested in anime rock music where VAs sing imitating little girls, you might find a few good ones in this one. I think that the OP and the EDs and...the insert songs were all quite good, and only one or two songs were memorable for me.The characters are mostly all lolis. This show inputs the ""dere"" categories into each individual loli. For example, the sister is definitely a yandere, and Nozomi, the purple haired girl, is a tsundere. This one will go into my collection of shows that utilize ""dere""s. The lolis are all cute and pure and there is mostly no sexualization of them other than showing some skin.This show was enjoyable since it was a heartwarming kind of anime and the characters were all very likeable.

I personally love any series that isn't afraid to ignore social stigmas and to push boundaries.It's very admirable."", 'This may contain minor spoilers. I really think this anime was fun to watch. Please don\'t overlook it because, ""Oh, there\'s loli\'s in it"".Story: For starters, the story is fair. 6/10 is what I give it.Kyou Nukui is a first year high school student hikikomori. His hobby is making vocaloid songs and uploading them online. One day, he receives a message from a fan asking if they could meet up with him. At the meeting place, three elementary school girls were waiting for him. The three of them want to form a band and ask for Kyou\'s help. The anime plays out from there.Art:...I give it a 6/10. I felt the glint from the characters eyes was a bit distracting. Made them stand out though. So, I didn\'t complain there. It was rough on the eyes at times. I feel later in the series it\'s even worse with quality. That didn\'t affect me much from enjoying the show at all. The style design for this anime looked to be done by someone who\'s in a rush or doesn\'t feel motivated to bring out the best in these characters. Just a feeling though. Average work.Sound: Like the art grade, also a 6. It did have a rough go with quality at times. The music was splendid however/on cue with the story/timing. So I couldn\'t say anything negative there. My favorite moment was the storm. The rain, heavy winds, banging noises, etc was spot on. Felt like I was actually in it.Character/Characters: Now to me, the reason I like this anime a lot was the characters. A lot of folk were looking at me like, ""you lolicon"". You may call me one, don\'t care. I\'m watching to see how the characters perform. So here goes with my detail explanation about them.Kyou Nukui: Apparently had a troubled past with bullying and stayed home from high school in the beginning of this anime. Boy, I can relate to him. I too had bullying problems when I grew up and was attending school. It was never fun, drives you to the brink. Anyway, I respect Kyou for taking his mind off of that and doing what he loves, making music. For me, it\'s watching anime/reviewing for fans like myself. It helps me take my mind off the world/smile. I respect Kyou as the series progresses he learns to become stronger and accept reality. Let the past go and continue living. He didn\'t do it alone either in making his decision. He had help.Jun Gotou: 10 years old, 5th grade. What\'s there to complain? She\'s a character. So stating she\'s a loli, is quite obvious. I personally liked Jun a lot as a whole. Believed she had wonderful character growth in this anime.She tends to act nervous around people she doesn\'t understand or know. Which is quite understandable. I think she needed a voters confidence which she gained help from her peers, Kyou, family. I admired her will to ask Kyou for help in the formation of the band. She demanded much from him. But what\'s wrong with asking for help when it\'s needed? It helps you learn. Which is why I was impressed with Jun. She grew to stand up for herself, be bold. It certainly was fun to witness.Sora Kaneshiro: A strange one. Her eyes 90% of the time were expressionless. At first, I didn\'t think I would like her. But her two thumbs up gig when she felt the mood, not to mention dozing off when it mattered. Made me smile/laugh at her presence. I wish I had Sora\'s ability to fend of bugs and other monstrous things. To me, she\'s the weakest link in character growth. Only part she plays is the encouragement of being their for her family/band. Oh and to pick on Kyou when it counts. Ha, ha.Nozomi Momijidani: When she introduced herself I felt she had a very unusual last name. But it explains why by the midway point of the series. Shaky family business. Something Nozomi wouldn\'t open mindedly discuss. If you exclude Sakura, she was the older sister type to me. She played it well. Always nagging, defending her family. She teased Sakura for the majority of it. Like Sora and Jun she wanting to become better too.Sakura Toriumi: I fell for her immediately. Her past intertwines with Kyou\'s. Explains also why she\'s had a crush on him since middle school/Kyou\'s class project assignment presentation. He was bullied, she defends him. Her classmates back off from her tough demeanor. She hides the fact she\'s playing two sides to this tale until later on. Watch and you\'ll find out what I mean. Still when she begins opening up to Kyou, it\'s a real treat. I like her passion for fishing. She enjoys the opportunity out near water than anyone else in the group. Picked that habit off from Masayoshi/Master, competing with him all the time when they are out. I think Sakura is really terrible at keeping her feelings together. Wished she was involved more. But this anime centers around our 3 5th grade MC girls.Kurumi Nukui: Kyou\'s sister. Voiced by the lovely Rina Hidaka who voices Silica from SAO. Man I enjoyed her. Jealous out of every corner. The pouting, the expressions. It was a real treat. I do like how she plays the piano but believes she is lacking in ability. I think she suggest it\'s boring and wonders if what her brother is doing is more lively. The biggest reason I like her in this anime as a support character is her will to look out for those she cares about. Like Kyou, Sora, Jun and Nozomi. She does throw a tantrum if not shown attention. Once again huge with jealousy. I enjoy characters most when they show it.Koume Ogi: Our loli friend who hides behind a PC in the beginning when exchanging messages with Kyou on his work/art. I must admit, I was fooled with who she really was. Involving Yuzuha like she did. Imagining her, but better. T_T. All is revealed in good time though. It\'s revealed she too is jealous. Likes Kyou a lot and wants nothing more than to continue to make art with him. I\'m glad she overcame her position/troubles in the anime too. Please watch if you wish to know what I mean.Yuzuha Algae: She plays well with deceiving others. She believed to be a servant family to Koume\'s and will respect her wishes at all times. I didn\'t think highly of her much. Please watch to find out for yourself, if interested.Last character is Masayoshi Sawatari: I\'m just glad he gave the girls a home and supported them throughout their decisions. The characters were a fun batch to witness and I feel it deserves an 8/10.Enjoyment: A 7/10. To be honest, I didn\'t know what I was walking myself into. My twitter mates thought so too. That it was unusual of me. But hey, things do happen. Changes are made. That\'s life. I enjoyed this anime more than it leads on to believe. Reminds me a lot of Fukumenkei Noise from the Spring season. Making a band, forming it, making music, practicing. It all brings tremendous feels. Never easy.Overall: I give it well deserved 7/10. Like any anime series out there that only receives 12 EP\'s. If chances were it was 20+, I feel this show could\'ve been an 8/10 or even 9/10. Involve more character growth too which is one of my biggest things I look at when watching anime. Story applies with any anime you watch. It\'s music. Sure they could do more with that too.Thanks for reading. I really type fast when relaying my thoughts. I really wish I had myself an editor/a person who was there to help with this.Also, I respect criticism given to my thoughts. Helps me learn. Don\'t hold back please.I\'m on twitter by the name of KnownAsVirtual. I give it a 6/10. I felt the glint from the characters eyes was a bit distracting. Made them stand out though. So, I didn\'t complain there. It was rough on the eyes at times. I feel later in the series it\'s even worse with quality. That didn\'t affect me much from enjoying the show at all. The style design for this anime looked to be done by someone who\'s in a rush or doesn\'t feel motivated to bring out the best in these characters. Just a feeling though. Average work.Sound: Like the art grade, also a 6. It did have a rough go with quality at times. The music was splendid however/on cue with the story/timing. So I couldn\'t say anything negative there. My favorite moment was the storm. The rain, heavy winds, banging noises, etc was spot on. Felt like I was actually in it.Character/Characters: Now to me, the reason I like this anime a lot was the characters. A lot of folk were looking at me like, ""you lolicon"". You may call me one, don\'t care. I\'m watching to see how the characters perform. So here goes with my detail explanation about them.Kyou Nukui: Apparently had a troubled past with bullying and stayed home from high school in the beginning of this anime. Boy, I can relate to him. I too had bullying problems when I grew up and was attending school. It was never fun, drives you to the brink. Anyway, I respect Kyou for taking his mind off of that and doing what he loves, making music. For me, it\'s watching anime/reviewing for fans like myself. It helps me take my mind off the world/smile. I respect Kyou as the series progresses he learns to become stronger and accept reality. Let the past go and continue living. He didn\'t do it alone either in making his decision. He had help.Jun Gotou: 10 years old, 5th grade. What\'s there to complain? She\'s a character. So stating she\'s a loli, is quite obvious. I personally liked Jun a lot as a whole. Believed she had wonderful character growth in this anime.She tends to act nervous around people she doesn\'t understand or know. Which is quite understandable. I think she needed a voters confidence which she gained help from her peers, Kyou, family. I admired her will to ask Kyou for help in the formation of the band. She demanded much from him. But what\'s wrong with asking for help when it\'s needed? It helps you learn. Which is why I was impressed with Jun. She grew to stand up for herself, be bold. It certainly was fun to witness.Sora Kaneshiro: A strange one. Her eyes 90% of the time were expressionless. At first, I didn\'t think I would like her. But her two thumbs up gig when she felt the mood, not to mention dozing off when it mattered. Made me smile/laugh at her presence. I wish I had Sora\'s ability to fend of bugs and other monstrous things. To me, she\'s the weakest link in character growth. Only part she plays is the encouragement of being their for her family/band. Oh and to pick on Kyou when it counts.

A Shut in Neet (Nukui) helping a group of girls with problems of their own as well. In helping the girls they\'re actually helping Kukui in return. Add in the girls ""Older Sister"" (Sakura) and her having some kind of past with Nukui we get some pretty decent back story and development from all of these characters.Art and Animation: I have no problems at all with the Art or Animation. I thought it was fantastic. I liked the details in the lips of the females and the small details the put into each characters design.Sound and VA\'s: I...mean the music was great, the Op and Ed were both really good, and the voice acting was fantastic. Again nothing wrong in this category.Characters: Nukui is another neet character who a lot of people can relate too especially when it comes to people who have been bullied in the past and just did not want to face the real world. Sakura I thought would be a typical tsundere pig-tailed character but she actually turns out to be pretty freaking awesome. Add in the three cute main girls with three other cute girls later on in the series and you have a pretty decent cast of characters.Enjoyment: The only thing that ruined my enjoyment of this anime at times was the times it would go over the line. Basically Loli Fanservice...not a fan whatsoever, especially when it comes to sexually explicit moments.Overall: As a music anime and a slice of life anime I would definitely recommend this show.

Definitely recommended.', 'I watched Tenshi no 3P because I adored Ryuuou no Oshigoto, a more recent loli show from the same studio. It was obvious straight away the two aren\'t at all similar in spirit or quality, and furthermore Tenshi no 3P shouldn\'t be compared with anything that\'s not also a pile of garbage. With the studio\'s next upcoming work being for a mobile game, one gets the impression they are all about budget contracts, so it\'s not surprising their output includes adaptations of trash.Overall, Tenshi no 3P is unsalvageable. Usually I wouldn\'t bother writing a negative review on an obscure last year\'s show that I should...have just dropped, but the contrast with Ryuuou no Oshigoto, still somewhat recent and superficially similar, is so stark that I thought it was worth noting.The show starts as weak, and devolves to being totally phoned in, becoming a letdown despite the start. Around episode 3 or 4 I was starting to warm up to it in a you-ground-me-down kind of way, but then after the band\'s first performance it kept going further and further off the deep end.There was no real overarching story - the band plays for the first time and then plays a few more times while a few bizarre or at least bizarrely handled sidestories happen. Seemingly major plotlines get casually dropped or brushed away multiple times, which at times felt merciful because of how bad the writing is. There was a ""Christian"" theme, gifting us with loads of hamfisted inspirational dialogue. At the beginning there was really squalid fanservice, and by the end there was full-on hareming, both of which suffered from the poor writing, and the visual quality, while adequate, didn\'t help them pop either.The best that can be said of the visuals is that they were competently cheap. Anything more would have been wasted on this show. I didn\'t mind the voice acting.My interest was perked for a second time when the mc promised to go on a date with each of the girls. I\'m not sure if I misunderstood or if that ""plotline"" just got dropped, because in the end he only ever went on a date with one, the story apparently preferring to spend its time on stuff such as a cringeworthy mentoring sequence.There were no eligible male characters other than the mc, because conveniently the mc was a shut-in pussy and therefore not even a token friend was required. There were traces of serious character development (or if there were more than just traces I\'m in denial because of how bad it was), but in the end everyone is fodder for comedy or sex appeal, which is not a criticism per se. Of course, the show fails to be funny, and the fanservice wasn\'t laid thick enough to carry it for 12 episodes either.

Spoiler-free review:I might be exaggerating, but although the season is fun overall, there\'s only a handfull of episodes with some actual cool racing scenes, out of 51.This season takes place in a time mid/post WGP, where all the kids, besides de protagonists, are running with cars copied from the ""pros"". You can actually tell which specific cars they are copying and even their names are adaptations of their idols. (For example ""Victory Champ"" is a copy of ""Victory Magnum"".)The last 2 episodes feature some nice moments, but still nothing compared to that S1 and S2 brought.Did I mention...the protagonists names? Gouki and Retsuya? Gou? Retsu? Really? And yeah, Gouki also has a straight-focused blue car, just like Gou\'s Magnum. Although Retsuya starts with a car like Tridagger, he will also end up with a car like Sonic. Zero originality.Overall, the whole season seems like a 51-episode filler, with some cool moments here and there. the protagonists names? Gouki and Retsuya? Gou? Retsu? Really?

Bakegyamon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2786/Bakegyamon,"['Gekifu Bakegyamon, one of anime that I watched when I was 13. It made me nostalgia so I planned to rewatch again. I simply watch only to remember some awesome moments in it, however, after understanding the anime a little deeper, it made me somehow impressed..Story: 9/10The story wasn\'t that promising at the first, people may accuse it like a generic game match, which the MC goes along and eventually win the tournament and his wishes will be granted. It involves the existence of Ayakashi, one of Japanese\'s mythical creatures being sealed as Gekifu in order to be used in a game called ""Bakegyamon"". Maybe...we will think: ""What\'s the reason of Bakegyamon? Why they seal Ayakashi in order to make children happy playing game?""After some explanation, I found that it\'s not just a generic game tournament using Ayakashi as tool in order to win and get your wish granted. It\'s more than it, and the backstory was quite sad and touching. Also the last episode, was also sad because they have to say farewell so they can\'t play together again..Sound: 8/10I really love the opening song, Mobius, sang by Janne da Arc.. the opening video also match with the song.. EPIC!! however, I don\'t really like the second opening.. even though, I love its 3rd and 4th ending song. Some of the sound effect seem similar to Digimon X Evolution\'s.Characters: 8/10The characters are interesting just they way they are. Maybe the Main Character here is just a typical shounen who always do before think, being hotheaded, and silly. However, he got a lot of character development, and he\'s the one who\'s sympathetic not only to his friends but also to the Ayakashi, and also his Koma, Fue. Other characters are also interesting, almost none of them are being dumped. Everyone has their touching backstory, even though some of them are quite silly (I\'m looking at you, Mick). They all have their own understandable motives of joining the game, not just joining without any reasons. They all got developed and finally grown up, Bakegyamon had changed their way of life becoming better, and understand that human and ayakashi can play together and become friend..Art: 7/10Quite decent, it\'s reasonable for its year production\'s quality. They did well 3D CG, though..Overall: 8/10This kind of niche shounen anime needs more and more love, I was sad that this kind of wonderful anime only got score 6.7. Maybe the watchers didn\'t like long episodes also they got bored by the first quarter episodes. Don\'t just judge something by its cover and its earlier episodes..I hope my review helps, thanks for reading we will think: ""What\'s the reason of Bakegyamon?

Bari Bari Densetsu (1987),https://myanimelist.net/anime/12745/Bari_Bari_Densetsu_1987,"[""What Initial D is to car fans, Bari Bari is to motorbike fans. And that's the greatest compliment a racing series can get. Hell, the manga was supposedly so good that people started to join the Bōsōzoku (Japanese motorbike gangs) in droves! Strange?Not really, since the same guy, Shuichi Shigeno, created Bari Bari Densetsu and Initial D - two holy grails of the petrol-heads. He also had assistance, in the form of his prominent student Jyoji Morikawa - the guy behind Hajime no Ippo.You know a racing movie is good when it starts with a shot of an idyllic road. The morning sun is...gently fondling the scenery and the birds are chirping. Suddenly the comforting scene is ripped apart by a raging motorbike noise. Two riders blast into the scene, taking the corners at a mind-blowing pace. They turn, they twist, they lean almost vertically as they literally eat the road.The camera zooms in, shifting gears, the parts move, the engine shakes, and the bikes roar like furious wild beasts. The riders become one with the road, the lines they take paint a work of art and the sound from the bikes, revving up insatiably, creates a symphony of destruction.When a movie conveys all this feelings, you know it's made by a driver, for the drivers. And Shuichi Shigeno is one of the rare people with a godly talent to make this right. The detail put in his work is insane, right down to the point, where you can hear the air getting furiously sucked into the intake.And not just the bikes, great care was also put into making detailed surroundings. You will actually recognize segments of racing tracks like Tsukuba and Suzuka, if you're familiar with them.Now this being a racing movie, you shouldn't expect a great story. And it really isn't, but by no means is it bad or boring. It's a tale that never gets old. About a young, fast but reckless, prodigy that wants to push his limits, and a rival, who challenges his skills and helps him transcend to the next level. There is also a girl, of course, who likes to stick around the fast boys.It's a very down to earth, relate able story and you'll be rooting for everyone involved by the end. It all builds up to one of the greatest races ever, with intensity hotter than any fire.This is all wrapped in a distinct 80's production, with the catchy music of the time. Fear not, there are plenty of moments where you'll be listening to just pure sounds of motorbikes being pushed to the limit. Also, this being partly a motorbike gang movie you'll get to see some action moments too. The most glorious one has to be where the main protagonist punches someone trough a closed car door (it's as awesome as it sounds).Speaking of motorbike anime, it's strange that so few were made, since the Bōsōzoku were quite a popular theme in the 80's Japan. Sure, biking is present in many of the classics of the time, like Akira, Megazone 23, etc., but only Bari Bari Densetsu seems to be fully devoted to it, besides Bobby's In Deep, which is a bit short and experimental, but also a great biking movie.Just like with Initial D, I can only end this review with the following words. If you're a racing fan, you'll scream with enjoyment while watching this. If you're not, you will become one. gently fondling the scenery and the birds are chirping.

The most glorious one has to be where the main protagonist punches someone trough a closed car door (it's as awesome as it sounds).Speaking of motorbike anime, it's strange that so few were made, since the Bōsōzoku were quite a popular theme in the 80's Japan. Sure, biking is present in many of the classics of the time, like Akira, Megazone 23, etc., but only Bari Bari Densetsu seems to be fully devoted to it, besides Bobby's In Deep, which is a bit short and experimental, but also a great biking movie.Just like with Initial D, I can only end this review with the following words. If you're a racing fan, you'll scream with enjoyment while watching this. If you're not, you will become one."", ""*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*Bari Bari Densetsu comes to us from the original creator of Initial D. The story follows illegal street racers on their path to professional races. Like Initial D, these teens ride on Japanese mountains swooping around corners at breakneck speeds. Additionally, if you loved the dynamic camera angles featured in Initial D, they're even better here because it's 100% hand-drawn and painted.Although Bari Bari lacks the uniformity of CG art, it depicts each race from numerous camera angles. Whether it's looking straight ahead, checking the speedometer, engine shots, or close-ups as riders lean around corners with their knee an inch away from...the pavement; you're bound to be impressed by its creators' artistic vision. However, my favorite mid-race animation is how the camera rotates around riders causing the scenery to shift. I'll admit, it's not perfect, but creating the appearance of a 3D space using only hand-painted sheets of plastic is worthy of praise. Furthermore, these complex camera angles occasionally extend to non-racing scenes and create a beautiful cinematic experience throughout the entire film.The story primarily follows Hideyoshi and Gun, two rival teens who will stop at nothing to one-up each other. They come from vastly contrasting backgrounds. My favorite is Hideyoshi due to his tragic background. Despite being in his teens, he lives alone with his sister since their parents' death in a car accident. He sees racing as his means for providing for himself and his sister. On the other hand, Gun receives the most screen time but is characterized as an antagonist. It's very easy to dislike him, considering how he's played out as a disheveled jerk who constantly antagonizes Hideyoshi for no apparent reason.Supposedly, Gun comes from a wealthy family, but they didn't explain that well aside from the fact that he's got an expensive bike. Maybe the 38 volume manga goes further in-depth on that. In fact, there are many characters and plot points introduced that the movie doesn't have enough time to flesh out fully.It feels like there should be two romance arcs, a love triangle, more in-depth characterizations for its side characters, and some backstory for how Gun and Hideyoshi met, but the movie is only 85 minutes. As you would expect of a racing movie, the plot builds up to a major race in its final chapter, and I think it's a high point for the film. Not only does this race test the rider's skills, but also their endurance considering it's a long race on a sweltering day.This immense challenge brings out the best in our characters as they push their limits as far as they can, some even crash and continue the race. In addition to the physical feats presented during this event, the struggle causes our characters to develop, leading to a fulfilling and emotional conclusion....which I absolutely hate...Seriously, this might be one of my most hated anime endings. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. I just strongly disagree with what happens and how that makes me feel.Overall, I give Bari Bari an 8/10. While this movie only covers a fraction of the manga, I think the directors and planners did a great job of spacing everything out as not to feel too rushed, though it's obvious this should have been at least a 24 episode series. I also didn't like how Gun was given the superhuman strength to kick a guardrail with enough force to cancel his momentum and crumple the steel-like aluminum foil.story 7art 9sound 7character 7.5enjoyment 8overall 8 the pavement; you're bound to be impressed by its creators' artistic vision.

VROOOOOOOOOOOM!!!Motorcycles are so fucking cool, dude. Seeing these ones animated so well when they might be obnoxious CG blobs today makes me happy.The story was pretty basic, and interesting to think about in connection to the mangaka\'s later work, Initial D. I think Initial D First Stage is damn near perfectly paced with great stakes because it all comes down to Takumi\'s relationships with the 86 and his rivalry with well-defined opponents. Bari Bari Densetsu doesn\'t exactly have that. It feels a lot slower when they\'re not racing and the original author\'s portrayal of women he was clearly not too interested in writing...is even thinner here than in Initial D. The movie stops dead for weird fan service scenes featuring the pink-haired girl (pretty cute design within this style, but it\'s not my favorite style), and one of those scenes is an attempted rape at knife-point. Where the rapist is even—I shudder to write this—attempted to be redeemed as a person immediately afterward. That doesn\'t work.But, even then, the fact that the racing is mostly semi-pro here takes a bit away from the Initial D formula, because there\'s no defined antagonistic opposition. The dynamic is that the two main rival characters have a love-hate relationship and they work together to win a qualifying race. That means there\'s no inter-race commentary or ""I have to beat him"" or psychoanalyzing the action. The race starts, it looks good, and it\'s over without you getting really invested in it. Of course, I think they realized this when it was initially being written because they added some crashes to make things more interesting.I understand there\'s probably more street racing in the manga, and I understand this is actually a summary of a 2-episode OVA, so there\'s more for people who want more. But I enjoyed the art a bunch and was otherwise left a bit wanting by it. is even thinner here than in Initial D.

They are kinda frustrating, and at times, annoying (here’s looking at you, Subaru of Re:Zero)WHAT I DISLIKE: There are some goofy cinematography in there that might take you out of the immersion for a bit. For instance, there was a shot-reverse shot between the MC’s reaction and a villain lunging towards him while yelling his name.

This isn\'t that CONTROVERSIAL ANIME with SEX AND VIOLENCE that you heard about. In fact there\'s almost no sex at all, just...groping.But enough about that, let\'s talk about the technical aspects, shall we? For starters, the pacing is horrendous.

The problem is the writing fails miserably to make the flow of the show exciting. As I\'ve said before when talking about pacing, this show drags a lot, and the writing doesn\'t help at all. The characters are dull and don\'t do much except for commenting in the current event. Most of them are just bland allies or enemies who eventually turn into allies or die after the most mid fighting scene you\'ll ever see.The animation is... decent. It suffers from the dull plastic look a lot of modern anime does tho, but it doesn\'t actively bothers me. The choreography of the fights is what drags the animation down, as a lot of it is just boring and doesn\'t have much happening. You\'ll have decently well made effects of fire and magic and lightning and whatever the fuck while nothing exciting happens or the characters exchange a boring dialogue.The music is, as par for the course, isn\'t jaw dropping either. Sounds like non-copyrighted 80s/90s power metal as you\'d expect. It is pretty disappointing still, as something with a huge metal motif should at least try to stand out for its music and not just name dropping metal bands for attacks and locations.In all, Bastard is bad, but not even the type of bad that would turn around into fun, it\'s just boring and not fun at all after the few first episodes where you realize it\'s going nowhere else.

I\'m shocked by how much fun I had with this.It dawned on me that this is what all those countless ""resurrected demon lord"" shows (along with most Isekais) try and fail to imitate.TL DR: it\'s KonoSuba parodying Berserk instead of Isekais.

If your on the fence i would highly recommend it if you have netflix already."", 'Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy, based on the eighties manga of the same name Bastard!!, BASTARD!! 暗黒の破壊神 Original Run August 25, 1992 - June 25, 1993. Highly influenced by Dungeons and Dragons and a lot of Heavy Metal influence. This is an epic fantasy! Like one of the most successful manga series of all time.So it isn’t surprising this anime has gotten its grubby mitts on the popular source material, but what is shocking though is how they haven’t updated the classic for a modern audience.like a lot of 90s animes:Yu Yu Hakusho, Slayers, Berserk. This anime is a great show to me. ', 'Disclaimer: Most of what I wrote ended up being a comparison to the older version, since on its own the current Bastard is nothing special, just another action show in a sea of action shows. The 90s OVAs on the other hand were special. Not only they came out at a time when sakuga was rare in the medium, they also did the smart thing and trimmed the fat, leaving only the juiciest parts. There was a lot of crap in the source material that is simply not fun to read. The more faithful new adaptation carried over those bits, and as a result we...got an average action schlock show that most will ignore or will be annoyed by, because of the horndog protagonist. And now for a more detailed breakdown.The previous adaptation of Bastard was one of the first anime OVAs I had watched on VHS during the late 90s and at the time it was the best thing ever. Fast paced, non-stop epic action, hot babes, amazing animation, cool characters, anti-hero protagonist, a captivating post-apocalyptic fantasy setting inspired by D&D, Jojo-esque references to heavy metal names, and a very basic but functional plot that both embraces cheesy fantasy stories while also making fun of them. It was schlock, don’t assume I thought it was a masterpiece or something, but it was the best possible schlock of its time.The new adaptation is far more faithful to the manga it was based on (yes, I have read it) with far more polished artwork and a super cool opening song (the previous version lacked one). It still lacks the best thing the older version had, which was the skipping of the secondary fights. You see, in the manga every big boss had several underlings who would get their own mini arcs and battles. Those parts were just stalling the final showdowns, meaning the most spectacular parts. The 90s OVA said ‘screw it’ and ignored them completely, focusing only the highlights. The new version doesn’t do that and as a result most of the episodes became a dull waiting game for when these useless mini bosses will be defeated and the big bad will finally make his move. It just wasn’t the same.Along with that came another big issue many others had with the show, and that is the constant sexual harassment scenes. Schneider is a horndog, that cannot change, but too much of something becomes a detriment. He constantly grabs tits and ass during the lesser fights. Since the 90s OVAs skipped those parts they also removed most of those scenes, so he doesn’t come off as THAT much of a creep. Also people nowadays are offended way easier and having dozens of molestation scenes in a row only manages to multiply the negative backlash, so again, removing them altogether was the best move.Something I noticed people defending in those lesser episodes was the importance of world-building. Although the anime is mostly a mindless action flick it also has its share of lore and flashbacks which can make you appreciate it more for not being generic warrior archetypes in a generic setting. So yes, a more faithful adaptation fleshes out the world and the cast much better. The issue is, it did it at the expense of the pacing, it had a lot more tasteless molestation, and it felt dull since you were just waiting for the big bad to come in and for the real battle to begin. Let’s also be honest, nobody gives a shit about the story in such types of anime. You only want to see action and hot babes. Several dull episodes that exist just to fill your brain with lore are just out of place, thus entertainment-wise they were a detriment.Lore and molestations stuff aside, the new version is also not as cool as the older version. It doesn’t have the same super-cool hand-drawn sakuga animation, spell incantations lack the impact of the older version, and in general everyone moves in a more stiff way because newer technologies use android animation and CGI that tends to make everything feel plastic and robotic. All that took away most of the cool factor and the result is a rather average-looking action flick. got an average action schlock show that most will ignore or will be annoyed by, because of the horndog protagonist.

Imagine yourself as a kid dreaming about having powers or what most anime depicts as the 8th grade syndrome, that’s Bastard!!. The anime shows off cool and flashy moves, which is typically found in shonen animes. So, why you ask did...I only give it a 7?

This is especially true of the female characters. For example, you have powerful fighters who are immensely skilled martial artists, which takes strong will and mental toughness to achieve. Yet not long after meeting the main character they're reduced to mewling automatons quivering at the mere thought of being close...to Dark Schneider. Softcore porn has better fleshed out characters.

Most of the things I saw I truly adore. Story was simple and engaging, characters were fun, music was on point and animation wasn\'t half bad either. I even got myself a new favourite for the MAL profile, that being the protagonist of ""Bastard"" Dark Schneider. This merciless, lecherous and goofy character is everything I wanted in a show bearing the words heavy metal and dark fantasy in its title. I can\'t praise this show enough. It was such a breath of fresh air in the sea of isekai and shallow romance...shows that take themselves too seriously which this day and age is full of.As hardcore as this show is with elements of overly explicit sexual and gorey scenes, it really doesn\'t take itself seriously and that\'s what I like the most about it. It\'s a fun dark fantasy setting with lots of cool characters besides the mc. He is, of course, a lady\'s man, but a real one, unlike other anime characters who just try to be him. Women are at his feet and even other men acknowledge him and his talents. Though he is also hated because of the huge amount of magic power he wields and how he uses it to spread havoc around the world.Many anime fans who prefer complex and  a bit confusing plotlines won\'t like this show that much. The introduction already explains most of the story and the world it is set in. You definitely don\'t have to think about things too hard. Just relax and don\'t let certain scenes put you off the show. It is a true classic gem.If I had to nitpick about anything regarding this show I\'d say that the lack of actual metal music is a bit lackluster. Sure, a hard rock opening and cool intense soundtracks do make up for it so I won\'t bash it too hard for just that.To end this, the first part of the show ended in a huge cliffhanger and I can\'t wait for the rest to come out.

It hints a bad ass theme done right in my opinion.So overall, I really think people should give this a shot. I for one will definitely look forward to the next episodes. Enjoy!"", ""After watching all 24 episodes of this, with most of it being out of spite, I can honestly say that I didn't like this anime. Other anime have done the power fantasy/harem better, and frankly, it's so much more frustrating to watch with a main character who is this insufferable and side characters who are this utterly infatuated with him. The sexual scenes are needlessly gratuitous and far too common, the fights are just ass pull after ass pull with no real strategy behind them, the reasons why everyone is doing everything remain murky at best and are dumb as hell at worst... hell, even...the selling point of the anime of having a villain essentially in thrall to the main heroine just seems more and more distant by the end. If a S2 of this is coming, I won't be watching it. the selling point of the anime of having a villain essentially in thrall to the main heroine just seems more and more distant by the end.

But as someone who's seen many anime I've seen this troupe so many times, so I can't really rate it like I'm new to anime lolVery horny characters, and they use a lot of eye candy to keep viewers watching. The interaction and the characters are alright. Decent story I suppose. Main character is best described as pervy/horny Inuyasha...who's powers are magic based.

I liked BASTARD!! for similar reasons that I liked High School DxD as well as JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure. It\'s dumb. But it\'s dumb fun and catches you off guard with the sheer amount of 80\'s metal references it gets away with, even more and less butchered by the localization than JoJo, mostly being lawyered up by spelling changes and adding hyphens in the subtitles.BASTARD!! runs itself on three rules:...Rule of Cool, Rule of Funny, and Rule of Sexy. This is a double-edged sword for BASTARD!!. On one hand, it\'s hard to take the plot seriously when, most of the time, it revolves around Mr. Schneider thinking with the brain between his pants, most fights just revolve around who can out-asspull the other, and the Fourth Wall is about as existent as it is in Deadpool. However, the sheer amount of these asspulls keep the audience on their toes, as surface level of a technique as it is, and its often juvenile sense of humor got a chuckle out of me more than a few times.It has a solid cast of characters, even if it is mostly composed of Dark Schneider, the women fawning over Dark Schneider, and the EEVILLL villains. Their motivations are kinda vague and most of the women (and my boi Ninja Master Gara) are won over simply by Mr. Schneider\'s gigachad energy, but they carry the plot nicely and are entertaining to watch. It is also very interesting to see the dynamic between ultimate sigma male Dark Schneider who gets mad bitches and his total simp side who is forced to respect wamen, mostly by Yoko, who is alright as a female lead and we get to see her fend for herself a fair amount of times for a muggle character, even if she is kind of a generic character that the female fanbase can relate to and mostly overshadowed by more interesting waifus like MY BOI NINJA MASTER GARA who steals the show with his charisma and has his fair amount of time in the spotlight even if he is sidelined late in the series as a live commentator for Dark Schneider, the other (actual) waifu that steals the show, Arshes Nei, has an interesting story arc late in the series and (while her backstory is a bit sus by today\'s sensibilities) the character is quite relatable for an anti-villain.Overall, BASTARD!! is great dumb fun and has a solid ensemble of characters, entertaining well-animated fights, and I almost forgot to mention the ABSOLUTE BANGER of an OP by coldrain.

Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy” is a breath of fresh air when compared to the modern fantasy anime genre.An adaptation of an 80’s manga, the show is free from all the popular tropes like isekai protagonists, video game worlds and levelling systems and from all “ThE hErO” (except Dark Schneider (self-proclaimed)) and “tHe DeMoN lOrD” bullshit that plagues almost all modern fantasy anime.This is not going to be an anime for everyone. If you’re not into your ecchi scenes which border on hentai, a rather predictable story or background characters (usually ninjas) giving a running commentary on how amazing someone...is for casting a spell or how awesome it was when a guy punched another guy then you probably won’t like this show. This is also not LIDENFILMS' best work. The animation can vary between looking good to something on par with Record of Ragnarok.However, there is a certain, unapologetic honesty this show gives off which makes it fun to watch. Dark Schneider’s whole goal is to kill the man who sealed him away and take over the world just so he can make a harem yet, he is completely at the mercy of his carer/love interest Yoko who only needs to chastise him once to get him to act like a puppy. He’s not the most original anti-hero out there (or maybe he is because this manga was written in the 80s?) but he is very fun, very loud and a hell of a lot better than certain harem protagonist whole Oh, I don’t know, buys a slave and Stockholm syndromes her into having sex with him, which is saying a lot.I like the world-building. A medieval setting with swords, magic and cool-looking monsters and ghouls. The magic itself is dependent on gods, catalysts and chanting which branch off into unique sub spells making the systems that govern them interesting and flexible.Also, I watched this dubbed which I can only describe as ‘What if 4Kids voice actors weren’t limited by censorship and did crack before every recording session?’ It is a wild, 80’s sort of camp acting that I haven’t experienced in forever and I fucking loved it, even when it was admittedly a bit cringe.You can always count on Netflix when it comes to ‘so bad, it's good’ anime. I don’t think “Bastard!! Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy” quite fits into that category. It’s not the worst nor is it the best anime, but it gave me the same sort of smile and enjoyment I got from watching “High Rise Invasion”. The sort of anime you recognise isn’t good but gives you the sort of laugh and glee you get from something that you know you probably shouldn’t be enjoying, but you are.

I came into this anime not knowing anything about it. I never watched the original adaptation and from what I understand is that it is a continuation of the original series released in the 90's. And even that has a low rating. Before you bash me for giving this anime such a low rating, hear me out. This anime is absolutely dogshit. I know and understand it is a parody fucking anime. When I went into the anime I really expected to see a world build where the dark-theme was serious and...there would be shit I shouldn't give a fuck about but end up giving a fuck. Instead, in this anime, I gave absolutely no fucks. The only thing I enjoyed was the fact there was a lot of hot female nude bodies. And I am not one to give an anime extra points just for teasing my weiner.The most bewildering thing is how LIDENFILMS were able to produce this absolute dogshit of an anime. I'm upset because instead of working on this, they could've decided to continue production on berserk or sumn. Although I know nothing about why Funimation got their hands on animating berserk and not LIDENFILMS, we can all agree it was the reason the anime series of it fell apart. No one fucking like that shit cgi crap. So in contrary to that, this anime had an enjoyable artstyle and animation. It felt like a mix of 90's ranma artstyle and 90's dark themed berserk.You may be wondering why I keep comparing this anime with berserk. It is because the main character is literally fucking griffith. They are both greedy fucks who's life is dictated by their own lust. There was a scene on the bridge, one of the fight scenes where Gara which is literally just fucking Guts, is crawling on the ground repeating 'I think im gonna die' while looking at this griffith impersonator hold Nei in his arms who is literally a long haired Casca. The only difference is Gara never fell in love with Nei and it obviously isn't a recreation of that fucked ending in berserk. Yea, evidently this anime is a meme and that scene was a reference to berserk. You may call me a bitch for reading into hard like that but it is because I have PTSD from berserk.What I can say is that I gave this anime a very different expectation which hurt it's rating for me. I thought i was going into a dark-fantasy anime that was serious, instead I got an anime that the more I watch, the less i care and enjoy the plot. It felt like the plot was not important and the only fun exciting bits were him fucking around with women. And the fact that each woman in the anime could really just be his main female protagnist is evidence. He only needs to commit to one of them and BOOM that is the main female prot. The animation is really the only thing that has it going for me. Maybe if you are looking for an anime to pass by time and one that is not heavy and should be taken light hearted you will enjoy this anime. Not for me though, I instantly watched redo of healer and that plot felt way more interesting than Bastard!!. Probably because redo healer is meant to be a hentai. Maybe if this anime was a hentai it'd be better lmao. 5/10 there would be shit I shouldn't give a fuck about but end up giving a fuck. Instead, in this anime, I gave absolutely no fucks. The only thing I enjoyed was the fact there was a lot of hot female nude bodies. And I am not one to give an anime extra points just for teasing my weiner.The most bewildering thing is how LIDENFILMS were able to produce this absolute dogshit of an anime. I'm upset because instead of working on this, they could've decided to continue production on berserk or sumn. Although I know nothing about why Funimation got their hands on animating berserk and not LIDENFILMS, we can all agree it was the reason the anime series of it fell apart. No one fucking like that shit cgi crap. So in contrary to that, this anime had an enjoyable artstyle and animation. It felt like a mix of 90's ranma artstyle and 90's dark themed berserk.You may be wondering why I keep comparing this anime with berserk. It is because the main character is literally fucking griffith. They are both greedy fucks who's life is dictated by their own lust. There was a scene on the bridge, one of the fight scenes where Gara which is literally just fucking Guts, is crawling on the ground repeating 'I think im gonna die' while looking at this griffith impersonator hold Nei in his arms who is literally a long haired Casca. The only difference is Gara never fell in love with Nei and it obviously isn't a recreation of that fucked ending in berserk.

If you can overlook the downfalls below you\'ll probably really enjoy it.I tried my best to watch this through since the good parts are really good, the animation and the music, but it\'s completely overshadowed by it\'s pitfalls. If it weren\'t for those or if they were at least a lot more subtle this would be close to a 7 which is what it\'s ranked.I\'ll start with the good even though you can\'t really overlook the...bad. It has some impressive animation and some good action for the magical spells as well as the metal music is nice. There\'s also some interesting world building and lore it lays the groundwork for but the thinly veiled desires of the writer completely change the mood of the show. The one exception to what I\'m about to describe below is that character Yoko which was partly why I was able to watch for so long besides the nicely done animation.Onto the bulk of this review and why I can\'t in good conscious continue with this show (from worst to least worse). If you don\'t see it when you watch the first several episodes yourself and really like this show then you may want to stop reading. There\'s a lot of thinly veiled non-consensual sexual activity that happens in this and no ""sucking the poison out"" isn\'t what the authors describing when you see the exact frames and poses the characters are put in. It even happens when there\'s no explanation sometimes of how someone got poisoned (yea I\'m looking at you Cockatrice battle). Also all the women in this show don\'t really serve any purposed other than to be objects to be ogled at as their clothes explode, then fall in love with the main character for no apparent reason other than he\'s a male, doesn\'t kill them, is warm to the touch (even after he literally molests them like it\'s a normal handshake), and they\'re all virgins. They all pose no threat to any male they face especially the main character who will usually grope them for no apparent reason while he takes his time to defeat them.There\'s plenty of other small cliche issues with this show but I could continue if these were all what was wrong with them like major plot armor for anyone with a name (no one really dies outside of the first couple episodes), every stepping stone gets set up as if it\'s a massive hurdle then topples over in the wind, the OH NO HE\'S DEAD... JK gets old and predictable really quick, all the protagonists enemies become his allies for some reason, there\'s lots of plot holes like an inconsequential side character is killed twice but then is completely fine worshiping his master in the next scene (Jodoh).

For nowadays standards, it's only serviceable at most.The story is really weak, name characters, character development, goals, even the most simple of all: the dialogues are the weakest I've seen in a while, they don't provide anything to the plot and only add minutes to the episode. The series also tries some comedy but falls flat on the delivery.Still, if you want to unplug your mind for a while, and enjoy some mindless OK action and OK fanservice I'd say it can be somewhat enjoyable, even more if you play it a 1.5x its normal speed. from the MC, is even worse.

The story is interesting and intriguing with many moments you wonder there is going to be a plot twist at the ending for sure. This dark fantasy has a 90s vibe to it but the animation are extremely well done. Some may say the show is at a slow pace, but it skips to the main parts in my opinion and the fight scenes are semi enjoyable.Biggest problem is the constant telling the audience what they themselves can see. The entire episodes is wasted on telling the audience what is happening right now, as...if the audience is little kids. That kills the show and makes moments seem corny as hell. There is no need for the characters in the show to be commenting on obvious things going on like a commentator. if the audience is little kids.

I was interested in this for the niche heavy metal references but not even those were good, only very superficial. Even the opening theme song is some generic commercialized garbage so they couldn\'t even get that right.The main premise of the show is also just gross, the main character is a young boy and within him...is an old and powerful mage. In order to transform he needs a ""virgin maiden\'s kiss"" (imagine doing this shit unironically in the modern day). But even worse the girl kissing him is also underage and it seems like they try to go the direction where she has some relationship or at least attraction with the transformed (as in older) guy.

This anime would have been better off with half the number of episodes. It overstays it\'s welcome with nothing new to offer. Even the latter half is the same endless boss battle that keeps repeating. I was waiting impatiently for the main villain to finally be confronted and the show to finally end, but the episodes just dragged on and then...there\'s a cliffhanger. And for the whole time, there are no stakes. The MC is immortal and omnipotent so there is zero suspense. We already know all the women will fall in love with him. That\'s well established from the beginning. So ignoring the throwaway story and cheap, hackneyed jokes and fanservice, what else is the draw? The art style is very 90s fantasy, much like the original OVA, and the animation is surprisingly good with high production values. They have ""good"" 3D monsters that don\'t look video game-y. The spells look pretty awesome when charging, although the payout can usually be kind of dull and fleeting, like a diver making a huge leap but slipping into the water with no splash. This is probably because they stuck with the low framerate, primitive look and dull palette to keep it all consistent. The music is generic heavy metal, nothing to write home about, although the ending can be catchy. I really don\'t see the strong death metal influence, other than some passing butchered names. ALl in all, just watch it for the lulz, maybe skip around for the set piece animations, but don\'t waste your time actually watching it completely through. there\'s a cliffhanger.

However, I acknowledge that character development often unfolds over at least six episodes, so there's potential for improvement. The narrative seems reminiscent of 90s or early 2000s anime, though the main character's current nature is a drawback. The storyline, revolving around a person gaining random powers and using them carelessly, feels somewhat generic, with the character's motivation centered on an unconventional goal. While I don't inherently dislike this plot, it appears underutilized in the first three episodes. Some critics label the main...character as brainless and a pushover, but I believe there's room for improvement. If the character undergoes meaningful development, the anime could be worth watching.

Ep.1 was the most exciting - the rich and exotic artistic style, the Aladdin reference with a new twist, the lively action sequences...they all led me to believe that Bucchigiri would be an imaginative anime.More questions arose as the story progressed, and none of them were resolved even reaching the very final episode. What exactly is a ""Honkibito"" and why Matakara wanted to become one so badly? What was the deal with Senya and Yichiya and why did they hae to settle this through possessing high schoolers? Why was Matakara so fixated on Arajin?...What was the use of the subplot involving Cat Café and Miss Jasmine?Moreover, this anime unquestionably failed in character development. The MC, Arajin, was such a simp and hardly outgrew himself; in the first 10 episodes, all of his actions were motivated by a desire for Mahoro\'s attention (or ""losing his virginity"", as he would proudly shout before every battle). Amidst the repeated fights among furyō (delinquent) groups, there was no opportunity for him to grow, making the Arajin in the final episode totally out of character. As for the other characters, I can only say that they each have their own craziness; the creators didn\'t seem to bother treating them as real ""characters"" with stories and motivations, but rather as a collection of symbols.

Frankly I find it more annoying than some simply clichéd plot.', ""From the director of Free!, Banana Fish, and Sk8 the Infinity, comes Bucchigiri?!, an anime about a pathetic shrimp of a man who is mean to his loving and supportive mother and is so obsessed with getting in a girl's pants that he keeps crudely ignoring his hot childhood friend who not only is so blatantly dtf, but also clearly cares about him and wants to reconnect with him.Like this director's previous shows, this one has no shortage of yaoibait, but it falls entirely flat because the main character is such an unlikable snotnosed worm. His kind childhood friend who clearly still loves him and...wants to be his friend again is right there, and instead he ignores him to go chase after a two-faced snake of a girl whose only personality trait is having a brother complex. Yeah, the only two women in this show are mom and one dimensional bad archetype. A+ Female character writing.Wanting to have sex with a girl isn't even an inherently bad character motivation, I would totally be down to watch some guy's trials in dating and girls, but I cannot bring myself to care about it because he's such a selfish idiot about it....oh yeah, what was the plot again?Bucchigiri doesn't have much of a plot. It's literally about this guy joining a gang because the leader of the gang is the older brother of the (terrible) girl he likes and he wants to have sex with her sooooooo badly. And this works out because the older brother has a no-personal-space type homoerotic fixation on him because he got lucked out with genie magic that gave him super strength. And his kind, caring, all-around-great-guy osananajimi is sad about it. That is the entire show.Still, I'm being a bit mean. This show is very fast paced and full of high-energy action scenes, with awesome character design and artwork to boot.

The main character Arajin is so cringe at how he interacts with Senya. He talks, no yells, at him in public and people are like huh? I get it's done for laughs, but I hate the trope. Because of this the jokes are kind of falling flat.But my biggest problem is...that Arajin is leaning on burrowed power.

I was so excited to watch Bucchigiri because its original creator, Hiroko Utsumi, also created one of my favourite anime, Sk8 the infinity, and worked on a few other favs such as Banana Fish and Free!. The characters and their designs for these shows are incredible; however, there is one huge, obnoxiously glaringly impossible-to-ignore flaw in Bucchigiri and that is the main character.If Arajin...was written to be hated by the audience, then the writer of the show is a genius because whenever this character is on screen I get so angry because he is a terrible person and an even worse ""friend.""At the start, I figured it would be fine to tolerate his little ""quirks"" for a while, which are made up of shunning and pushing away his childhood friend, harassing a girl who has demonstrated multiple times that she is not interested in him, and running away from tense situations with his hand literally on his ass because he gets nervous sh*ts when the going gets tough. But this would be okay if it were just the first few episodes, SURELY he would develop into a likeable character with SOME redeeming qualities, right?Spoiler: I made it to episode 8 and he has yet to develop at all. The only thing that matters to him, even now, is losing his virginity. He has set his sights on Mahoro, who regularly ignores Arajin\'s affections and advances, lets him know to his face that she wants nothing to do with him, and has a brother complex. His childhood friend, Matakara, has been trying to re-kindle their childhood friendship but to no avail as even now he gets rejected with every attempt, even though his friends are telling him that this absolute neet is definitely not worth his time, and I have to say I agree with them.Even when it comes to the fighting scenes, Arajin relies on Senya to channel his strength through him but never actually develops any fighting skills or powers himself. Another thing is that Arajin doesn\'t actually contribute much to the story; it feels almost as if he just happens to be there most of the time and other characters are forcing him into the plot. Things kind of just happen around him instead of him actively making decisions that contribute to the story. I\'m not really sure how to put it into words, but think of it as if you are walking down the street and suddenly there is a terrible vehicular collision on the road nearby. Like yes, this is an important and significant event, but you didn\'t actually do anything for it to happen. You were just kind of there and now you have to deal with it?I\'ve seen a lot of people comparing Arajin\'s character with that of Denji from CSM because they are both degenerates who just want to get laid, as teenage boys often do, but the difference between Arajin and Denji is that Denji actually has some redeeming qualities as a main character and moves the plot forward himself instead of being swept along by it.Do not waste your time with this one.

I was prepared to give this show a 4 after discovering it so long after it initially released. And, considering how the rating (as of now) is a 6.5, it seems as though a lot of people agree with me. However, after just finishing the final episode now, I have raised my score up quite a bit. And, as you can see, I recommend it. Quite strange right? Well, let\'s talk about it.The main gripe that Bucchigiri has left upon me, and probably the single aspect I will remember most about the show,...is that it suffers from a chronic condition known as terrible main character syndrome, or TMCS for short. What does this mean? Well, 9 times out of 10, when a show is suffering from chronic TMCS, the side characters and other plots tend to be layered, likeable, well-thought out and overall just developed more than the main character the show is supposed to be about.Another anime that is unfortunately diagnosed with TMCS that many people know about is a romance anime known as ""Rent-a-Girlfriend"". You see, the story of Rent-a-Girlfriend **on paper** is actually very interesting, and takes a unique spin on the romance genre. Yet despite this, it is consistently downvoted on all seasons and is given lower scores. Why is that? Because the main character, Kazuya, makes the show insufferable to watch. Comparatively, it is as though you\'re using extremely expensive headphones to listen to someone scratch a plate with a fork, or a chalkboard with their fingernails. Not fun right? Neither is watching Rent-a-Girlfriend.Anyways, what does this have to do with Bucchigiri? This show, at least in my eyes, has the exact same chronic condition as Rent-a-Girlfriend and many other animes that are out there for you to watch. In simple terms, I find Bucchigiri\'s story to be concretely fleshed out in all aspects, enough to not even warrant another season or even side stories. I need no extra explanation, I don\'t yearn for any extra details, and I do not see any plot holes. This is extremely rare for anime, and I don\'t think there have been many anime, if any, I can think of that have done this in the past. (maybe besides Summertime Rendering? but that was 2x the length of Bucchigiri so..) However, despite all of this, the major flaw in Bucchigiri is the main character himself, Arajin.Many words can be used to describe Arajin. Some like self centered, egotistical, arrogant, and many more come to mind, and are quite accurate. However, only one word is needed to coin exactly what he is, and that word is an ""asshole."" Bucchigiri is the first anime to truly make me hate a main character for the first time, at least, to the extent that I have. It\'s even more concerning that it was unintentional, as well; let me explain.*** (THIS NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS, LOOK FOR THE NEXT PART LIKE THIS TO AVOID) ***Within the 12 episodes that Bucchigiri has, within just 7, Arajin has deserted, abandoned, and even betrayed both the friends that treasure him, the people who look out for him, and those who look up to him. Why, you may ask? Why has Arajin treated everyone around him so cruelly? Because a girl on episode fucking one talked to him. Yes, that is literally the reason. And, not to mention, THIS GIRL FUCKING BETRAYED HIM TOO, AND WITHIN THE FIRST EPISODE. She literally led him to the spot with the school\'s best fighter, to get his ass kicked, just so she would watch her brother kick someone\'s ass. She has threatened him multiple times, has shown she is not interested and has said it, has actively put him in harms way multiple times, and has told him to leave her alone.To how far does Arajin simp for this girl, you may wonder? Well, let\'s dig deeper!Arajin decided he wanted to join the girl\'s brother\'s gang (again, the guy who almost killed him) instead of his childhood friend, (who got him out of many fights and has saved him from getting jumped) simply because he thought it\'d help him pull. (and never said anything to his childhood friend)Arajin tried to beat the shit out of his best friend\'s clan leader because he thought it\'d help his odds pulling the girl.Arajin betrayed both gangs to join a third one, while knowing the entire time the leader wanted to kill all of his friends, just to try and get laid.Arajin knew his childhood bestfriend was being held captive by previously mentioned gang leader, and did not rescue him, because he was trying to get laid. (he went to the extent of going to the room his friend was in, opening the door, ungagging him, and then leaving)Arajin watched as his best friend fought to save both their friends, and watched him almost die and did not intervene.Arajin watched all of his friends get beaten WITH REAL WEAPONS and did not intervene UNTIL he saw the woman he simp\'d over get hit once.There are plenty more, but I will not dwell on this point alone. Let\'s continue, how else is Arajin a terrible MC?Arajin is consistently extremely rude to his mother, even going to the point of physically assaulting her multiple times.Arajin literally ignored his childhood best friend, who saved his ass multiple times, for the majority of the anime. The only time he interacted with him was out of pure coincidence, where he again, punched him or brushed him off. (or if the woman he was simping over was involved, somehow)Arajin never used his newfound power for good, and actively used it only for personal gain SPECIFICALLY WITH WOMEN....and there are many more instances I can point out to how Arajin is conceptually the worst anime protagonist I think I\'ve ever laid my eyes on.***(HEY, YOU! THE SPOILERS END HERE! YOU CAN KEEP READING NOW!)***However, I still think, despite all of what I listed, Bucchigiri is still worth a watch. Now you must be thinking, ""Dude, this guy is crazy, there is no way after everything you\'ve just said that it can be worth a watch."" but just here me out for a minute.I think, in every other aspect besides the main character being a total asswipe in every sense of the word, Bucchigiri excels. Diving into extremely rudimentary words here, it\'s awesome.When it comes to character design, visually at least, there has not been many anime like Bucchigiri. Every character for me, background or not, is memorable. Not to mention, they are extremely well thought out and unique.In terms of writing, there are many plots to diverge in, but the author of the source material presented it in a way where it is very, in simple terms, easy to follow. You\'ve got tons of stuff to be interested in, whether it be the main characters themselves, the school they go to and their gang wars/history, the power system, the background of the ""colossal demons"" that MAL\'s description calls them, and many more to wrap your head around. And, by the 12 episode mark, they are all finished perfectly. Even the funny bits that have no actual plot development get a conclusion, it\'s awesome.I also just find the story itself extremely interesting, concept wise. Two gangs are duking it out in a high-school when a newly awakened kid with magical genie powers comes in and changes up the social structure.Of course, being animated by MAPPA, the animation is extremely smooth, and top of the line. I consider MAPPA to be one of the best animation studios out there, so expect the visuals to be very worthwhile, if that\'s something you\'re interested in. (kinda reminds me of a Disney animated movie if that makes sense?)And the ending man, I don\'t know what the general conception or what prior reviewers think of it, but it really hit me emotionally. (I think it\'s really good if you can\'t tell)Overall though, what do I think?I think this is a beautifully crafted anime with amazing production tainted by a main character with questionable decision making and a terrible, asshole-y nature. I think that the anime would\'ve excelled a lot more in ratings had the main character been someone.. better? I guess. I\'ve been so torn this entire time on what to rate this though. Initially, while watching it before I had gotten to the conclusion, I was planning on giving this a 4. Naturally, after it ended I felt a lot better compared to that previous rating, and considered an 8 or 9. Naturally though, the greatness of all of the side character, plot, and everything else cannot excuse the terribleness of the MC.If you can get past the bullshit, terribleness of the MC, I think Bucchigiri is an amazing watch, and definitely something I recommend. If you can\'t? Hey man, I don\'t plan on watching the rest of Rent-a-Girlfriend, so to each their own, I guess. I can\'t be a hypocrite and you say you must and to just ignore the main character and persevere! I barely made it past the horizon myself.Overall rating:7.6/10, would be ~9 if the main character was better. is that it suffers from a chronic condition known as terrible main character syndrome, or TMCS for short. What does this mean? Well, 9 times out of 10, when a show is suffering from chronic TMCS, the side characters and other plots tend to be layered, likeable, well-thought out and overall just developed more than the main character the show is supposed to be about.Another anime that is unfortunately diagnosed with TMCS that many people know about is a romance anime known as ""Rent-a-Girlfriend"". You see, the story of Rent-a-Girlfriend **on paper** is actually very interesting, and takes a unique spin on the romance genre. Yet despite this, it is consistently downvoted on all seasons and is given lower scores. Why is that? Because the main character, Kazuya, makes the show insufferable to watch. Comparatively, it is as though you\'re using extremely expensive headphones to listen to someone scratch a plate with a fork, or a chalkboard with their fingernails. Not fun right? Neither is watching Rent-a-Girlfriend.Anyways, what does this have to do with Bucchigiri? This show, at least in my eyes, has the exact same chronic condition as Rent-a-Girlfriend and many other animes that are out there for you to watch. In simple terms, I find Bucchigiri\'s story to be concretely fleshed out in all aspects, enough to not even warrant another season or even side stories. I need no extra explanation, I don\'t yearn for any extra details, and I do not see any plot holes. This is extremely rare for anime, and I don\'t think there have been many anime, if any, I can think of that have done this in the past. (maybe besides Summertime Rendering? but that was 2x the length of Bucchigiri so..) However, despite all of this, the major flaw in Bucchigiri is the main character himself, Arajin.Many words can be used to describe Arajin. Some like self centered, egotistical, arrogant, and many more come to mind, and are quite accurate. However, only one word is needed to coin exactly what he is, and that word is an ""asshole."" Bucchigiri is the first anime to truly make me hate a main character for the first time, at least, to the extent that I have. It\'s even more concerning that it was unintentional, as well; let me explain.*** (THIS NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS, LOOK FOR THE NEXT PART LIKE THIS TO AVOID) ***Within the 12 episodes that Bucchigiri has, within just 7, Arajin has deserted, abandoned, and even betrayed both the friends that treasure him, the people who look out for him, and those who look up to him. Why, you may ask? Why has Arajin treated everyone around him so cruelly? Because a girl on episode fucking one talked to him. Yes, that is literally the reason. And, not to mention, THIS GIRL FUCKING BETRAYED HIM TOO, AND WITHIN THE FIRST EPISODE. She literally led him to the spot with the school\'s best fighter, to get his ass kicked, just so she would watch her brother kick someone\'s ass. She has threatened him multiple times, has shown she is not interested and has said it, has actively put him in harms way multiple times, and has told him to leave her alone.To how far does Arajin simp for this girl, you may wonder? Well, let\'s dig deeper!Arajin decided he wanted to join the girl\'s brother\'s gang (again, the guy who almost killed him) instead of his childhood friend, (who got him out of many fights and has saved him from getting jumped) simply because he thought it\'d help him pull. (and never said anything to his childhood friend)Arajin tried to beat the shit out of his best friend\'s clan leader because he thought it\'d help his odds pulling the girl.Arajin betrayed both gangs to join a third one, while knowing the entire time the leader wanted to kill all of his friends, just to try and get laid.Arajin knew his childhood bestfriend was being held captive by previously mentioned gang leader, and did not rescue him, because he was trying to get laid. (he went to the extent of going to the room his friend was in, opening the door, ungagging him, and then leaving)Arajin watched as his best friend fought to save both their friends, and watched him almost die and did not intervene.Arajin watched all of his friends get beaten WITH REAL WEAPONS and did not intervene UNTIL he saw the woman he simp\'d over get hit once.There are plenty more, but I will not dwell on this point alone. Let\'s continue, how else is Arajin a terrible MC?Arajin is consistently extremely rude to his mother, even going to the point of physically assaulting her multiple times.Arajin literally ignored his childhood best friend, who saved his ass multiple times, for the majority of the anime. The only time he interacted with him was out of pure coincidence, where he again, punched him or brushed him off. (or if the woman he was simping over was involved, somehow)Arajin never used his newfound power for good, and actively used it only for personal gain SPECIFICALLY WITH WOMEN....and there are many more instances I can point out to how Arajin is conceptually the worst anime protagonist I think I\'ve ever laid my eyes on.***(HEY, YOU! THE SPOILERS END HERE! YOU CAN KEEP READING NOW!)***However, I still think, despite all of what I listed, Bucchigiri is still worth a watch. Now you must be thinking, ""Dude, this guy is crazy, there is no way after everything you\'ve just said that it can be worth a watch."" but just here me out for a minute.I think, in every other aspect besides the main character being a total asswipe in every sense of the word, Bucchigiri excels. Diving into extremely rudimentary words here, it\'s awesome.When it comes to character design, visually at least, there has not been many anime like Bucchigiri. Every character for me, background or not, is memorable. Not to mention, they are extremely well thought out and unique.In terms of writing, there are many plots to diverge in, but the author of the source material presented it in a way where it is very, in simple terms, easy to follow.

This...could\'ve been good, but it\'s a wreck.If you have been in the AniManga industry for long, you would recognize people for their certain traits, as much as I have done throughout these years. Take for example: the young and rookie Keiichiro Saito, with 2 banger shows under his belt being both Fall shows of 2022\'s Bocchi the Rock! and last year\'s Sousou no Frieren a.k.a Frieren: Beyond Journey\'s End, his stardom as a rising director is quickly shining to great effect. To put this in contrast, Hiroko...Utsumi, like Keiichiro Saito, is also a director, but she has earned her fame the same way by directing and creating shows that have always connected with the Yaoi fanbase, primarily of Summer-Fall 2018\'s Banana Fish and Winter 2021\'s SK8 the Infinity. With both shows having the same ripple effect of the delinquent and psychological themes, her next injection into the same creation has resulted in her next breakout: this Winter season\'s Bucchigiri?!, a delinquent-themed show that is centered in school with Arabic themes, alongside series composer Taku Kishimoto, TOHO Animation and of course, the marriage of Banana Fish, resulting in MAPPA having another work of Hiroko Utsumi\'s name. But as the saying goes: ""Third\'s the charm"", it sadly does not apply to this show whatsoever, and I\'m going to tell you why.Earnestly, reading the synopsis does not help you a lot in understanding what Bucchigiri!? is all about. The TL;DR is this: an old friend coming back to see his old friend, yet changed a lot, and just wants to live life the easy way, despite reality not being so. This is the story between childhood friends Arajin Tomoshibi and Matakara Asamine, both boys with the aspiration to grow stronger and become Honki People: people who finds a heart that does not flee, people who devoted themselves fully to reaching the top, in power and strength. And after a long absence, Matakara finds himself aspired to become a Honki Person, but Arajin...relapses on their childhood dream of being that, because he\'s done with it.First off, Arajin Tomoshibi is just a rather weak character: one who does not fight for his own beliefs, yet allows people to shuffle him around like a tool, which he does not like people to manipulate him so. Be it on his first day in school where the usual fights are broken out by two main rival gangs: Minato Kai and Siguma, and hidden ones below, Arajin just does not care and has only one goal in mind: to lose his virginity. Thankfully, there\'s the only famed schoolgirl around: Mahoro, that he can take his time to flirt around with her and do his bidding. The reality is that Mahoro is twisted, and a temple that encases these Honki People, Arajin is forced to fuse together with Aladdin...er wrong, Senya, the Genie that provides him strength when he needs it the most. Like it or not, he\'s done with the delinquent life, and just wants to rest in peace...which if that\'s his goal, then leave him alone, but things are not easy around him as he easily cowers at the sight of conflict, very much like a conflict-avoidant person who just wants matters out of his hands. It\'s just that as an MC, Arajin is not properly thought out, or I\'m going to assume that this is rather intentional to depict real human behaviours, of which I can say that I understand Arajin\'s character because I\'m quite like him to some degree...which if this is the show\'s ideal of making him such an unlikable character, go through so much change, then it pretty much succeeded in that (refer to @CarlosRock\'s thread about Arajin not being a bad character as you\'d think).Friends, join in, which is where Matakara Asamine comes into play as the right-hand man of one of the rival gangs: Minato Kai. His upstanding as a delinquent has given him amounts of respect from the gang he belongs to, even by its leader: Doman ""Ken"" Kenichiro. He\'s the undoubted spokesman when it comes to affairs against rival gangs, as much with Siguma, under the leadership of Jin Marito, a crazed fighter who likes his big pork buns. Both he and Marito are the school\'s ""legends"" when it comes to rivalry, and they\'re not afraid to show off their strength in order to capture the stakehold of the entire school under their belt as the superior gang. Even on the Genie\'s side, Senya is not the only Honki People whose powers are granted to its user, but there is a yang for every yin, and Senya too, like Arajin and Matakara, has a close buddy which he regards as his close friend in search of true prowess, but has lost his way to evildoer status, looking for a fight through the right person who could extend his lead in real life.In a way, Bucchigiri!? supposedly teaches about courage in weakness (which is its biggest lesson by the way), but the anime doubles down on that and applies to Arajin, of which he\'s really not the best character to be written and shown to the audience that he\'s all that. As much as a wimp that he is being similar to Takemichi Hanagaki of Tokyo Revengers (yet another delinquent series), I have to admit that even I\'ve come to like Takemichi\'s character growth more than Arajin, who doesn\'t face his problems head-on.Sigh, not even MAPPA can escape its arduous work processes, working on both high and low profile shows to no end, which is something they must be blamed for in taking too many simultaneous projects at once. On the other hand, you can expect the same MAPPA greatness in all of their shows, and Bucchigiri!? is no different in that regard with high-octane action and great animation, what\'s there not to love when MAPPA, despite not being given a break, can pump out consistent animation like this? It speaks volumes, both on the good and bad ends.The music, which is mainly focused on Arabic themes, gets the good cut for the most part, thanks to veteran music composer Michiru Ooshima helping out on the project. This may be hip band Kroi\'s 2nd Anisong (after last Fall\'s Under Ninja), but it definitely fits the themes for a show like this, not to mention the song itself being funky and catchy. For Mahiru Coda\'s debut Anisong, her ED song ""Love je t\'aime"" gets the rhythm down for the most part, but the song is rather fine and unmemorable at best.The reiteration of the saying: ""Third\'s the charm"", and this time, it failed to resonate with people on another iteration of ""SK8 the Infinity"" if it was ever made on the delinquent level. I mean, props for the creativity, but the MC is really (literally) to die for the unpleasant experience of watching Bucchigiri!? as a whole. If you can tolerate his character, be my guest, because it\'s still a decent show with the whole ""Arabian Nights"" feel to it. Not great, but not bad either. Utsumi, like Keiichiro Saito, is also a director, but she has earned her fame the same way by directing and creating shows that have always connected with the Yaoi fanbase, primarily of Summer-Fall 2018\'s Banana Fish and Winter 2021\'s SK8 the Infinity.

Like holy hell this show has it in spades.Agreeing with what most people point out that this is just ripped out of late 90's early 2000's anime, however it is filled with the current pizzaz's that newer anime have.I think one of the problems I can see happening here is the same issue mashle and other over powered mc's have where it's hard to create a threat, however I think what...this anime does best so far is the focus on an over arching story and homoeroticism(bless this anime for that.)that's all shout out this show. this anime does best so far is the focus on an over arching story and homoeroticism(bless this anime for that.)that's all shout out this show."", 'Full disclosure upfront, I only picked this up because I was in dire need of some good bara-bait character designs and I thought the genie guy looked neat. If that\'s all you want from this show, it 100% deliver on that. Otherwise, it\'s been a mixed bag. The most succinct answer I can give in whether to recommend or not would be a pathetic ""Mileage may vary""Pros:The art direction for this show is something amazing. Honestly some of the best designs for characters I\'ve seen from anime in a long timeThe aforementioned Bara-bait. Not just the genie, but a few others as well....If you\'re in want of some decently handsome muscled anime husbandos, you won\'t be for want with Bucchigiri?!Piggybacking off the previous point, this show is INCREDIBLY homoerotic. It\'s not subtle about it either, especially when you factor in the way the only female love interest acts. Apparently, that\'s par for the course with one of the creators. A pleasant surprise nonetheless.It\'s giving off some juicy early 2000s anime vibes. Especially the opening gives me some serious nostalgia for back when I\'d watch School Rumble on old Hulu or staying up late to watch Toonami.Cons:The MC. This boy is... something. A lot of the humor with him falls flat to me. This is due to the act it can boil down to: MC shits his pants when he\'s nervous. MC is a massive simp for Girl Character. MC shouts at the genie (who only he can see) in public making a fool of himself. or MC wants to have sex. Credit to the fact that he\'s one of the most accurate portrayals of a teen boy with how he only thinks with his ""second head"" and has no higher brain function than that. This kid makes me grit my teeth every second of screen time I have to slog through. Normally it wouldn\'t be so bad if he wasn\'t, you know, the main character we spend most of the show with! I can only hope he improves in some capacity.The story is moving so gosh dang Slow! who knows, maybe it\'ll ramp up the speed tenfold as we get further in, but 1/3 of the way in the story is slow and unfortunately boring. Again we are a THRID of the way through and it still feels like episode one.In summary; The MC sucks, the story is slow, but the designs are rad, the vibe is nostalgic, the guys are hot, and the undertones are deliciously homoerotic. You just have to decide how much you can put up with. For me, My tolerance for stupid Main Characters dwindles further with each passing year. I don\'t know if I\'ll drop this show or not, but if I do, know it was the MC\'s rancid personality.

They forget that this is a COMEDY anime. COMEDY. I mean, come on Arajin's name is a literal play on Aladdin. He himself is a joke of course he's not gonna be the cool protag you want him to be. He's just a teenage boy that fell for a girl in love with her brother and all he cares about is losing the vcard as teenage boys do. The jokes in this anime are great.  I had a great laugh, the Arajin virginity joke, Mahoro being a bro-con (btw her character is literally the...joke, she is the character that is in love with their sibling hence bro-conflict. It has been done before in other anime), Jasmine-chan, Arajin's mom and even the ending.This anime may be off-putting at first when you watch the first ep, but it gets SO much better. This is a good anime, cause it was interesting that they kept the backstory for later. They had fun with the many characters they had. Character design was great, and I loved each of their personalities except Shindo cause omg dude stop scratching your neck. I can tell that those who can not stand these types of anime are literally the ones who laugh at Pop Team Epic or Asobi Asobase cause those take it to the extreme. While this anime, just has a simpler humor that a certain type of people get. I am one of those people who get it. This anime isn't bad just cause you yourself don't get the jokes or don't find them funny. I mean, it probably is mainly due to the repetitiveness, but that's my kind of humor and I understand that it is not for most people, but that does not mean this anime is terrible. Either get past it or just drop it.The story is overall interesting on its own. The history between Senya and Ichiya, Matakara and Arajin's past conflict.  It was cool that they made their stories sort of overlap each other. I also adore the mix of Japanese and Arabian culture as the concept. Made the world feel new and different. Matakara's internal conflict was fascinating, cause it was good to see how much fear can affect one's mind. Especially if said person ends up turning on their beliefs. I loved seeing sweet baby Matakara literally lose it.As for the ending, it was nice to see it go in a more serious direction and finish things off in a special way. It was cool that they made it feel like two fights at the end. The fight between Ichiya and Senya, and the fight between Matakara and Arajin. It all wrapped up nicely, and I'm glad they didn't end it on like a calm note, cause of course it reminds you again that this is a comedy. Might as well have a little fun before ending things.

It was cool that they made it feel like two fights at the end. The fight between Ichiya and Senya, and the fight between Matakara and Arajin. It all wrapped up nicely, and I'm glad they didn't end it on like a calm note, cause of course it reminds you again that this is a comedy. Might as well have a little fun before ending things.

I really recommend guys should give a chance too  !', ""Kinda sad mappa, the legendary studio, created this disaster, which obviously gave alot of high hope for people but alas the rating wasnt exaggerating but was right and kinda overrated. More like, i amazed for those who actually finish this anime, i mean i do too but istg i been itching to drop this anime since episode 5.Plot: Its about becoming a Honki person which supposedly a very popular tale in japan. I heard about it before but the anime sadly only explain its story briefly at the 1st episode. And then never again, and shift the focus on how a brawler genie named Senya,...possessed the MC which nobody likes. Ofcourse he can grant wished but didnt even grant them??? I guess unlike genie, he wasnt able to grant a wish eventhou he said he can. Moving on, the MC enrolled into gangster school and yada2 he got into a fight aaaand he use genie as his fighting power. The gangster part is much more interesting than about Honki person. I know people hate comparing anime but imma say it, its like tokyo revenger except the MC is much more shyt, simp and coward. The fight and gangster is actually good but they wasted it by making the most pathetic character becoming the mc of the show which i will explain later on.Character: Hooo boi, this is the main reason why this show is unlikable. Our MC is the most annoying character of all time. Hes a simp, not loyal, stupid, weak, coward and noisy. Everytime he appear on screen i have an urge to punch my screen. Hes the MAIN character and the MAIN core of the show being disasterous. Imagine, you want to avoid watching him so much but forgot that hes a MC of the show. Thats how hatable he is. Does he develop his character througout the show? NOPE. Unlike the MC, i actually love the sides (ahem they all ikemen and bishounen). Their personalities are good and interesting. However they not enough to save the show cuz, yes the MC, has the most screentime than the side characters. And so i keep going for the side characters and I had feeling that the best part of the show is the MC not being on the screen.Ending: Still bad, Arajin still determine to go out with literally a girl who rejected him but ofc his stupid azz thinking he isnt get rejected. Matakara, who fell into depression got ignored by the MC. Yes the MC literally dont care and tbh what is his purpose in this show? The finale moment is SO FORCED of the MC SUDDENLY care about Matakara, which he never does before. The only good thing from the ending is ofc, the side characters are happy and living in their moment except for the MC who still unable to get LAID. Im so glad this show doesnt have a potential for season 2, unless they decide to change the main character.Summary: The show sadly has potential, without the MC, the show can go out of the roof. But nope the MC wont develop from his shtty annoying personality. All he is, is that he is a p*ssy chaser, no, hes not loyal, hes been chasing other women in the show. Hes not even a 'friend' as the show trying to convince us that he is traumatised for being a coward and unable to backup his friend. Bro is the definition of choosing a girl over your homie. He literally wont fight unless A GIRL involve which is VERY SHYT. Ah yes i still complaining about the MC, overall not recommended but i am a simp for the hot side characters tho.Also im giving 5 instead of 4 cuz ahem, the hotties are on the screen. possessed the MC which nobody likes. Ofcourse he can grant wished but didnt even grant them??? I guess unlike genie, he wasnt able to grant a wish eventhou he said he can.

Cutie Honey F,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1853/Cutie_Honey_F,"[""Classic yet refreshing, Cutey Honey Flash offers a totally different perspective on one of Go Nagai's biggest cult shows.Cutey Honey (or Cutie Honey) made her first appearance back in 1973 and she is known for being the first ever Magical Girl who transforms to fight evil. Many people refer to her as Sailor Moon's great predecessor (or even grandmother), which is both correct and incorrect. Even though Sailor Moon did what Cutey Honey had already done two decades before, there is a great difference between the two franchises that often goes unmentioned. Sailor Moon was aimed at teenage girls, on the contrary Cutey Honey was...aimed at teenage boys. But what happens when you take the Cutey Honey franchise and decide to turn it on its head and aim it at teenage girls? The answer is Cutey Honey Flash.Cutey Honey Flash is a Magial Girl show, not a shonen, not an ecchi. It was made in 1997 to replace Sailor Moon in its time-slot, considering Sailor Moon Sailor Stars was reaching its end. Hence, it was conceived with the unmasked intention to appeal at the demographic of Sailor Moon fans, mainly made up of teenage girls, little girls, many young adults and many boys as well. Because of this, a big part of the creative team that worked for Sailor Moon Sailor Stars, directly went on to work on Cutey Honey Flash. Therefore, at a first glance many may think this is nothing but a direct Sailor Moon rip-off. You could not be more wrong.Cutey Honey Flash has an identity of its own and what I like most about the show is its attentiveness to tradition. Aside from the basic stuff (teenage girl protagonist fights evil), nothing else in Cutie Honey Flash reads as rip-off or caricature of Sailor Moon. They took a lot of aspects of the original Cutie Honey show and pressed refresh. Honey Kisaragi is a 16 years old student and she is definitely not the girl next door (or, to say, not the lovable airhead clumsy protagonist that is so common in shojo shows). Honey is strong, determined, very agile and incredibly charming. She is also very sweet and considerate and though she could be snob or act superior, she is actually down-to-earth and extremely kind to anyone she meets. She possesses many great qualities that could make a character look completely flat and one-note, but this is not the case. Without giving out much, let's say that Honey can become very emotional very easily, and the way she always tries to hide this aspect of her personality makes her even more entertaining and it gives her depth. 'Entertaining' is a word that can be easily used to describe most characters on this show. The villains, the likeable love-interest Seiji, the caring friend Natsuko, the mysterious Prince of Moonlight, the comic relief Danbei, they each possess unique characteristics that instantly make them interesting and well defined. Even minor characters and episode-villains are interesting, well defined and amusing. There is not one dull moment around these people.Aside from its likeable and interesting characters, Cutie Honey Flash presents a really well written plot. The show could easily be divided in three parts, three distinct narrative arcs. The storytelling is what makes it; it is rich in humor, action, great plot-twists and many intense moments. Cutie Honey Flash takes its time when trying to develop a character's path, but it never becomes boring or God forbid uneventful and bland. Aside from some minor parts, with which I had a problem or two, it is not rushed. It should also be noted how the storytelling often manages to do things the unconventional way. Sure, the evil organization Panther Claw wants to take over the world like it happens in most Magical Girls shows, but trust me when I tell you it's not as simple as that with this one. In other words, you know the writing is great when it manages to make you love and feel sympathy even for the most crazy and evil-willed characters.The entertaining development of the story is enriched by the great visuals. I am simply so in love with the character designs and art-style all around. Honey can take multiple forms and she looks breathtaking every single time, her outfits are creative, fashionable and the color palette is always on point! What's even better is the character design of the villains. Most episodes feature new enemies that vary in style, colors and even form! It is incredible how much the character design can help enrich the writing of the characters. It is not just clothes and colors: the visual aspect of the characters is part of the storytelling. Most episodes (if not all, really) are well animated, especially during the fights scenes. Cutie Honey doesn't just stand there, she fights and she fights well. The lighting should also be mentioned. It is apparent that no choices were taken lightly while developing the show. The lighting plays a big part during the storytelling; some scenes have such great and intense lighting that really boost the moment and make the scene so much better. Hence, I feel the need to declare that I am absolutely amazed with the visual aspects of the show.As if all of this wasn't enough, everything is accompanied by some great music. The opening theme for the show is the same used for (almost) every Cutey Honey production and this version is probably my favorite, it's just so catchy and it goes perfectly with the pretty visuals. The soundtrack really enriches the atmosphere of each scene and it really helps enhance and take out the intensity of the characters' emotions. Special shout-out to the transformation music, it really makes the moment ever so iconic!One of the few things that bugged me was the way they treated the fan-service. If you know Cutey Honey at all you definitely know that it is a brand that heavily relies on fan-service, we could even say it takes pride in it. This version is definitely not as fan-service-y as other versions, but there is still some. That was the problem with me: the show doesn't really know what it wants to be when it comes to fan-service. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's just another everyday Magical Girl show. It feels as if the staff hadn't really planned how far they wanted the fan-service aspect to go with each episode and it looks like the choice was for each episode director to make.In conclusion, I would say that Cutie Honey Flash is a massively underrated show that deserves to be watched and I would suggest anyone to do so, especially if you like Magical Girls. Aside from the more technical aspects I referred to above, it all comes down to how enjoyable it is, and it was. The show knows how to find the right balance between intense moments and lighthearted everyday adventures and it keeps the watcher constantly entertained. I know I loved a show when I press play on the final episode and think to myself of how much I don't want it to end. Doesn't happen as often as I wish it did sadly! If you like adventure, a well-written story with interesting characters and great visuals, Cutie Honey Flash is absolutely a must-watch. aimed at teenage boys.

She's tough and not afraid to be sexy. And even though she was one of the first magical girls, she stands out just as much as a unique character as she did in the 80s. Most versions of her story are pretty similar only to each other. There's one major outlier, though: Cutey Honey Flash.As the series that took over Sailor Moon's timeslot when it first aired, Cutey Honey Flash is not the ecchi/action sort of magical girl series you'd expect from the franchise, instead following a more typical formula. It takes place in high school, it's totally family-friendly, and...It's very episodic. In every episode, Honey and her friends start out doing something typical of teen girls (or at least what little girls wish that their teenage years would be like). Then (rather underdeveloped) evil strikes, and Honey has to transform and fight evil. There's an underlying plot, of course -- in this one, Honey is trying to rescue her missing father -- and a mysterious yet helpful man (sound familiar?). It's far from unpleasant, but it's very much your typical magical girl plot and atmosphere. Rather underwhelming, really, and while I understand that the intention was to give Sailor Moon a spiritual successor, Cutey Honey Flash doesn't bring anything new to the table to make it stand out from Sailor Moon and other similar series.Still, Cutey Honey Flash retains a decent amount of the charm in other versions. While Honey is meeker in this version, she's still a strong character, both in the sense of being well-characterized and the sense of kicking a lot of butt. A version of the classic theme song is used as the opening, along with Honey's costume being a variation of the original. Honey still has her transforming abilities, too; she solves problems brought by the villains by transforming into different types of people. It can indeed fun to watch the traditional components of the original Cutey Honey mixed with your standard magical girl tropes, and I'm glad that even in a different genre, Cutey Honey Flash still has some of what makes other versions great.Full disclosure: I only understand English, and this review is for those who are in the same boat as me and wondering if they should try out this series anyway. Cutey Honey Flash has only been fansubbed up to the ninth episode, with little sign of more coming up. It may become a very different show in the next thirty episodes, but for now they aren't available. For now, it's a solid but not fabulous watch for magical girl fans who don't mind seeing every 90s trope in the book, and Cutey Honey fans who also enjoy more traditional shoujo. It's very episodic.

The production team might have been the same talented one behind the absolute masterpiece of animation Sailor Stars, but there is nothing Sailor Moon specific here except some really tenous visual homages to that one like a one-and-done lips animation during a Cutie Henshin pose, or some barebone concepts similar to those present in that one. For the rest, this beast (in a good way) of an anime is a thing of its own, with the main character...having a different modus operandi, che supporting cast being completely different, the ending being completely different, etc. etc. etc. With that out of the way, the Sailor Stars production team apparently was EXTREMELY TALENTED beyond belief because this not only is hands down the best product with the Cutie Honey brand slapped on it (including the fun Cutie Honey Live Action series and the Cutie Honey live action movie from Hideki Anno) but it manages to elevate what was the absolute worst animated product I\'ve ever experienced in my whole life since starting to watch animes back in the early 90\'s - the original Hideous with a capital H Tokusatsu/Exploitation 70\'s Cutie Honey ""anime"" series by master of overrated hacks and wanna-be exploitation/porn director Go Nagai - to a really enjoyable, fun, engaging, heartfelt and cute series that you\'ll watch from start to end with no hickups, no will to drop it, amazed by the top-notch animation (incredible compared to the unwatchable and extremely dated by the time animation of the 70\'s crap), well choreographed and diverse fights, shoujo inserts that are friggin\' loveable ecc. ecc. ecc. The only thing that might a bit bother you is the usual japanese sexism for which a woman\'s only dream in life is to marry and have kids which is not true in any way, but between treating a characters literally ONLY and not ALSO as a stimulant for sexual libido (there are indeed several shots in this series with Honey completely naked during the Cutie henshin sequence, but they don\'t feel like forcibly trying to elicit a wanking from you) in the most hamfisted, unpleasant and in-your-face way ever put on animated form and this kind of sexism I think I\'ll go safely with the latter if the result is an enjoyment over 9000. This series and the linked short OAV (an elongated episode) are literally the definitive version of the character, completely trumping everything with the direct intervention of sucky Go Nagai in all regards. Watch this and forget the godfriggin\' awful nightmarish monster - I can\'t legitimately stress how bad it is, the spectator being a man or a woman it doesn\'t matter.

Chousoku Spinner,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2703/Chousoku_Spinner,"[""This is clearly a children's show and a way to fuel sales for yoyos during the yoyo boom. It shows overdramatic scenes of yoyoing and in general overexaggerations of yoyoing in general. It's similar to Yu-Gi-Oh! in that it was used to sell boost a product and a simple thing was made into something ridiculous. As a yoyoer, I found it very interesting and funny. The storyline has hooks to it that make you want to watch the next episode. Of course, things were very corny and the English dub made it even funnier. I'm sure many Japanese kids went out to buy their own...yoyos after watching this, only to leave them in a closet to gather dust and move onto something else. I definitely enjoyed watching this anime! yoyos after watching this, only to leave them in a closet to gather dust and move onto something else. I definitely enjoyed watching this anime!"", '(this is a review of the english dub of Super YoYo)""This is why beginners look so foolish!"" - Kogure ChutaSuper Yoyo (original: Chousoku Spinner) is truly one of the greatest pieces media created in modern times. Inspiring the masses to play more YoYo and striking fear into the heart\'s of supporters of the YoYo devil this series truly impact any- and everyone who watches it.Story: 10/10Super Yoyo is an anime about Shunichi Domoto, a young student who enjoys helping out his peers with their sports related struggles, succeeding at everything he tries but never settling down into one discipline to focus on. After one such...request he gets involved in the world of YoYo, starting a rivalry with the handsome, smart, talented and rich emo spinner Seito Hojoin. To beat him Shunichi joins the Japan Championship Carnival competition, facing off against many different and powerful foes (such as best girl Kirisaki Mai). The series follows his struggles and triumphs before and throughout this competition.Characters: 10/10The character writing in Super Yoyo is truly outstanding. Wether it be Benkai and his hilarious antics as a comic relief character or Seito Hojoin the emo spinner who is the biggest threat in the series, Super Yoyo\'s characters are always rich and interesting, enrapturing the viewers. The most impressive of these characters is the YoYo Cowboy shown in only a few scenes of episodes 19 and 22. Even through his short screentime his personality of being a cool Yoyo Cowboy is perfectly conveyed to the audience. Furthermore there is a fundamental dissonance in his character design, the conflict between the life of a Cowboy and the life of a Spinner is implicitly conveyed to the viewer, capturing both their attention and love. Another of these briliant characters is Kirisaki Mai, one of Shunichi\'s opponents in the competition, facing off against him in a VR hoverboard race on the moon. Her diligent yet prideful nature makes her an intimidating threat to Shunichi and she also has a lot of briliantly executed comedic scenes after her inevitable defeat.Art: 6/9The brilliant art style designed by Hashiguchi Takashi paired with the outstanding animation created by studio Xebec create one of the greatest artistic masterpieces since Leonardo DaVince. The characters constantly look gorgous and the changing artstyle reflects the development of both the characters and the story. All character designs are unique and memorable, especially the Yoyo Cowboy, who is dressed like an outlaw cowboy but is actually a spinner. Kirisaki Mai\'s design is also notable, being one of the most fanartable characters in anime history.Music: 9/10Music in Super Yoyo is probably the most incomprehensably brilliant part of the entire anime. It encapsulates the series\' themes and ideas perfectly. Even if in part it might seem mismatched it is all part of the briliant story, creating the correct emotional response in the audience not through an alignment but a juxtaposition of the themes conveyed by music and text.Voice Acting: 10/9The english dub of Super Yoyo is the best thing about the show and it is what made me want to write this review in the first place. It is truly one of the most unique and exhilerating things I have experienced in my life and it has honestly changed me as a person for the better. Not only do the voice actors perfectly convey the emotions of the characters, their unique voice acting talents enhance the original characters even further, raising them to another level entirely. I don\'t want to go into more detail here as I want everyone to have the opportunity to experience this masterpiece for themselves.Enjoyment: infinity/10Super Yoyo is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable pieces of media out there and I wish from the bottom of my heart that anyone reading this review watches it.All in all Super Yoyo is one of the greatest anime of all time, inspiring people to play Yoyo and entertaining you with it\'s brilliant comedy at the same time. That is why I would rate it as a 10/10 request he gets involved in the world of YoYo, starting a rivalry with the handsome, smart, talented and rich emo spinner Seito Hojoin. To beat him Shunichi joins the Japan Championship Carnival competition, facing off against many different and powerful foes (such as best girl Kirisaki Mai). The series follows his struggles and triumphs before and throughout this competition.Characters: 10/10The character writing in Super Yoyo is truly outstanding. Wether it be Benkai and his hilarious antics as a comic relief character or Seito Hojoin the emo spinner who is the biggest threat in the series, Super Yoyo\'s characters are always rich and interesting, enrapturing the viewers. The most impressive of these characters is the YoYo Cowboy shown in only a few scenes of episodes 19 and 22. Even through his short screentime his personality of being a cool Yoyo Cowboy is perfectly conveyed to the audience. Furthermore there is a fundamental dissonance in his character design, the conflict between the life of a Cowboy and the life of a Spinner is implicitly conveyed to the viewer, capturing both their attention and love. Another of these briliant characters is Kirisaki Mai, one of Shunichi\'s opponents in the competition, facing off against him in a VR hoverboard race on the moon. Her diligent yet prideful nature makes her an intimidating threat to Shunichi and she also has a lot of briliantly executed comedic scenes after her inevitable defeat.Art: 6/9The brilliant art style designed by Hashiguchi Takashi paired with the outstanding animation created by studio Xebec create one of the greatest artistic masterpieces since Leonardo DaVince. The characters constantly look gorgous and the changing artstyle reflects the development of both the characters and the story. All character designs are unique and memorable, especially the Yoyo Cowboy, who is dressed like an outlaw cowboy but is actually a spinner.

And that time yoyo is effin expensive and why it so expensive tho? I was curious about that one yoyo anime I watched when I was in preschool so I looked it up and found some footage. I honestly wasn't expecting an anime this old to be this good at portraying modern yoyo. I guess some modern yoyo tricks are much older than I thought, or probably much older than me. It's sad to see they don't take this kind of anime and toys anymore but hey at...least we got PS5 amirite? But yeah watching this today might be the if not least the funniest and geekiest anime because the yoyo battle arc.

Yeah there's a lot of awkward moments in there such as awkward pauses, awkward voice acting, dialogue said twice in a row occasionally, dialogue being changed with flashbacks, etc etc. Also kinda held back by the fact it's an anime...from 1997/8, so the animation could've been better. If there was a remake today it'd probably be way more enjoyable honestly, but hey. Still enjoyed it for what it was, fun YoYo anime actually.Lame ending though and there could've easily been a season 2 for this show, but it wasn't meant to be, which is a shame.Oh yeah and there was also this super irrelvant filler episode in the middle of the show with aliens that were never touched upon again afterwards. Hate the fact it even exists tbh. This show could've easily been like 20 episodes max, but oh well.I know the review says I gave this a 6, but it's more a 5.5. Just the site doesn't do .5s, so I rounded it up. from 1997/8, so the animation could've been better. If there was a remake today it'd probably be way more enjoyable honestly, but hey.

Emblem Take 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9837/Emblem_Take_2,"['This is only anime I can find that actually tackle the Yakuza seriously (That has been translated), and boy is this a good one for that. It\'s unfortunate that this never really gets off its feet before it ends, but i\'m grateful for what I got regardless.Emblem Take 2 really doesn\'t aim to show the Yakuza in a positive light which is a good thing as far as i\'m concerned, they\'re the Mafia, they shouldn\'t be glorified. It shows them as cheap, petty, conniving bastards. It shows some of the awful ways Yakuza go about their business, such as when our main character Jouji terrorizes...a dirt poor family for their money. But it also shows how a lot of them are only in it because they need the money and have no other option because they fucked up, such as our main character or those university boys who were kicked out after getting drunk. And how they\'re constantly fighting in a business where only the fittest survive. The one downside to Emblem Take 2\'s story though is that it doesn\'t really end conclusively since it\'s only two OVAs which probably didn\'t do too well.Visually Emblem Take 2 impresses me since it looks kind of good considering it\'s a 90\'s OVA that was bound to fail due to its target audience not existing or being very small in the anime world. It\'s nothing too spectacular mind you, it\'s no Cowboy Bebop or Macross that\'s for sure, but it looks good enough that I thought it might be worth a mention. The animation certainly can be a lot worse than it is. In terms of sound i\'m not sure I can say much since i\'m not Japanese nor do I know much Japanese, so I don\'t feel like I can judge Japanese voice actors. But even so, I feel like I can say that the voice actors did in noticeable well in certain scenes such as the opening one with Jouji\'s getting beat up. The music itself is actually better than I would have expected. Some of the tracks that come on sound very generic 90\'s, but overall the background music felt very ""mafia"" if that\'s a word and as a result fit the show.I feel like there\'s not much to say about the characters other than the fact that they felt very believable, and very natural and the one that mattered most was well written and interesting (Jouji of course, and his lady friend). Most of the characters might not show a lot of depth (Maybe they do in the manga, but I don\'t think that\'s translated into English) but I feel like expecting that out of two 40 minute OVAs would be a little too much.Ultimately, Emblem Take 2 is a nice anime and certainly the one i\'d pick for most underwatched and underrated out of the anime i\'ve watched. If you are reading this and haven\'t watched it already, I would 100% recommend it if you want to see an anime about Yakuza or even crime drama about organized crime in general.Final Score: 9/10 a dirt poor family for their money.

Fight Ippatsu! Juuden-chan!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5973/Fight_Ippatsu_Juuden-chan,"['I’ve reviewed a LOT of bad anime for this site, but today I’m doing something I don’t normally do. I’m writing a request review for a friend’s birthday. This will be a tough one to get through, but I happen to really, REALLY like this person. So why not? This is Juden Chan, the worst magical girl anime you’ve never heard of.So what is Juden chan about? It’s about a magical race from another dimension called Juden, who cure depression by shoving magical AC cords into people and giving them electroconvulsive therapy. I’m just a few sentences into this review and it’s already awkward!...In Japanese, Juden or 充電 is a word for “Re-charge”. In German it means “Jews”, which entirely changes the context of the series. It would actually be a better series if it was about magical Jewish psychologists flying around and trying to cure depression. The adventures of Freud-chan and her friends Maslow-chan, Kohlberg-tan, and Adler-chan. Hideaki Anno makes a guest appearance and keeps wanting to interview Freud-chan! Sadly, that’s not what happens.What happens is an angry guy beating the magical girls to near death with a baseball bat as a feeble attempt at slapstick comedy. However, the physical violence directed at magical girls isn’t what this series is remembered for. For those rare individuals who have seen Juden Chan, the thing they most remember about the series is the pissing. The female characters can’t go 5 minutes without pissing themselves. The weirdest part is that I read the manga in preparation for this review and it doesn’t happen ONCE in the manga! It would appear this addition was entirely the whim of the anime’s director.The mangaka for Juden Chan was Bow Ditama, most well known for KissxSis. He also wrote the slightly better Mahoromantic Robot Maid. Ditama isn’t the best writer in the world, but he’s NOT the problem here. The problem is the anime’s director, Shinichiro Kimura. This guy is an evil madman! He’s the director of Popotan, which still ranks in the top 10 worst anime I’ve ever seen. He also directed Sleeping with Hinako, which is another piece of shit I’ve reviewed. He took a harmless, stupid ecchi and made it a painfully unfunny, cringe-worthy fetish show. Even if you happened to have a pee fetish, I’d be willing to bet all my money this show still sucks! Despite this being unwatchable garbage, it still got an English dub and DVD release here in the US…in 2016. This anime was made in 2009, but 7 years later Media Blasters purchased it, dubbed it, and released a censored version on Crunchyroll. Mind blowing!I feel like I lost half my brain cells watching this show. Let’s do some brain exercise! Since this is Juden chan, our topic will of course be piss. Did you know that the UK banned the erotic portrayal of urination in 2014, which makes this anime illegal in the UK? It’s not just peeing on people, but ALL urination. Since “squirting” is over 50% urine, all female ejaculation was also banned by the same law. Most controversially, the law hilariously banned cunnilingus while blow jobs remained legal. These standards were voted on by an all-male council of septuagenarians appointed by noted pig fucker (cough) I mean moral paragon David Cameron. I can’t leave you with just one pee fact! This is Juden Chan damn it! Did you know that with some practice, women can pee much farther than guys? To understand this, we need to consider both human anatomy and physics. The male urethra is 5 times the length of the female urethra. This is important because of the laws of fluid dynamics, which state that the velocity and flow rate of liquid moving through a tube is inversely proportional to length. Also, the male urethra travels through the prostate gland, which impedes flow. While male physiology gives a strong advantage in arm wrestling and running contests, we’re not well suited to pissing contests. Thank you for teaching us Juden Chan!You may be thinking, “That’s fucking gross! Why would I ever need to know this stuff!” Remember a quote from beloved Juden science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, “Any increase in knowledge anywhere helps pave the way for an increase in knowledge everywhere” In Japanese, Juden or 充電 is a word for “Re-charge”.

I\'m surprised that nobody had licensed and dubbed this yet.Seriously, though.  If societies could be judged by the themes of their cartoons and Japan allows its anime industry to create works like ""MM!"", Kodomo no Jikan, Girls Bravo, and even the Clannad franchise; then there\'s no hope for that country and its people.

Co\'z of his role in the anime I give this part a ""POOR"" number 3.Enjoyment: With Sento hitting the girls with a bat........I\'d say it\'s a ""DREADFUL"" number 2.Overall: This is a kind of anime that every future chauvinist or wife beater should watch, this anime could have been nice without Sento hitting the female character with the bat, I can forgive the squirting, but not the girl beating. And frankly I\'m not watching any further.Trivia: In Africa, there is a certain tribe which the women literally would ask a man to flog her. beat the crap out of him myself if I were a character in that anime.

Anime often has humor that wouldn't fly in the west, one of the reasons I love Japan for making it- so if you're sensitive and likely to be triggered by such things- please run to your safe space now.Charger Girl is about these really unique magical girls who are invisible- they fly around wearing red latex suits and they...can see how happy or sad you are- and if you have a low score- below C I think- they extract this huge plug from a nearby transformer and zap you to 'recharge' you and make you happy. Their job is to fly around and find depressed people and zap them to cheer them up- that's it. Except there's this one guy who actually can see them- and as soon as he does- WHAM! Shenanigans ensue.Sento-kun, the crazy male lead constantly beats up on Plug, the adorable Charger Girl; the girls beat up on each other, and some of the humor is so shocking it just makes me laugh out loud- but the whole thing is meant to be fun and nobody wants any harm to come to Plug. This sort of humor used to be a way to get you to empathize more with a character, which is how it worked for me- every time Sento slugs poor little Plug I just want to give her a hug! Unintentional rhyme there. None of it is meant to be violent, it's very old fashioned slapstick comedy, like the Three Stooges or one of those really old comedy shows. And the characters do develop a meaningful relationship... and that makes it very rewarding. Either way, Plug is one of the cutest magical girls, this anime is so unique and odd, the closest thing I could compare it to might be Squid Girl? It's actually an Ecchi and there are some bare breasts and minor nudity, as if the girls' latex suits weren't suggestive enough.Anyway if you need to be cheered up- then give this a watch. You'll feel zapped by the bizarre humor, or you'll hate it... but you won't see another one like this that's for sure.

Unintentional rhyme there. None of it is meant to be violent, it's very old fashioned slapstick comedy, like the Three Stooges or one of those really old comedy shows. And the characters do develop a meaningful relationship... and that makes it very rewarding. Either way, Plug is one of the cutest magical girls, this anime is so unique and odd, the closest thing I could compare it to might be Squid Girl? It's actually an Ecchi and there are some bare breasts and minor nudity, as if the girls' latex suits weren't suggestive enough.Anyway if you need to be cheered up- then give this a watch. You'll feel zapped by the bizarre humor, or you'll hate it... but you won't see another one like this that's for sure.

The reason is because a show like this could never even be contemplated in the United States.  It would be self-censored out of existence.  So I commend the Japanese people for fostering a culture of tolerance that would allow such an insane, crazy, gross and masochistic show to exist.As with all good light anime, there is a nice, universal message running throughout.  In this anime, Charger Girls use huge plugs to charge up depressed humans...before their hearts give out.  The organization they work for is run for profit and strives for efficiency and volume.  But Plug, seemingly the worst employee of the bunch, has a different approach.  Simply ""charging"" someone stuck in a rut will not solve their true problem.  Plug realizes that if she waits patiently for the right moment when inspiration, resolve and passion coalesce, her charging has far more lasting effects.  This takes far more time and leads to many complications but Plug is willing to risk her life for others and sees her work as a calling, not a job.Not bad for a ecchi anime with girls whose outfits are designed to expose the inner half of both nipples.Now, if this were just ecchi, I would love it.  The females are beautifully drawn, their outfits are jaw dropping and the lack of true overt sexuality gives it an air of innocence that makes Charger Girl a fun, light, fantasy show to watch in between serious anime dramas.  Also, the anime-within-the-anime is also well done and exaggerates the already heightened elements of Charger Girl.  I really look forward to those snippets.That said, there is apparently a certain sub-genre of anime that associates urine (pee) with sexuality and I have to say I find it kind of gross.  It\'s quite jarring in an otherwise light ecchi show like this so be forewarned.There are also a lot of female beatings - often with a baseball bat.  Now, I totally agree that men getting annihilated by females for lulz in anime is fine so the inverse should be true.  My real problem is that it gets redundant, boring and is really out of character.Case in point: If you were a single guy in your 20\'s and two Perfect 10\'s from another dimension floated into your room wearing skin tight clothing, would you repeatedly attack them with a baseball bat on sight?  Would the visual of Plug floating on all fours in your living room send you into a blind rage?  Hell no.  That\'s the true problem with the violence.  It makes no sense.If you can excuse some of its more extreme elements and are looking for a light show  to watch, consider plugging in to Charger Girls! before their hearts give out.

Don't pick up the pitch...forks yet!). For example, Plug Cryostat sounds a lot more energetic and youthful than the sub, whereas in the sub, she honestly sounds about as mature as Arrester (who is supposed to be the mature one), but more energetic. I also think the dub does a better job of the emotions the characters have when excited, worried,  and etc. The dub is absolutely 10/10.The animation also felt great, movement was smooth, I didn't notice any weirdness, and movement conveyed emotions.I also loved the art. every character looked different and despite being 720p I think it's still better than some of the newer anime out there.Character development is noticeable and visible as you go on through the anime and honestly is the biggest reason I rate Juuden-chan so highly, I mean it helps that they're all interesting from the get-go, but to see a character go from struggling to express themselves to being more able to (this is just an example), is just plain enjoyable!The story ain't got huge depth to it, there isn't some journey to find some volcano to put a ring in  (somebody should really write a story like that tho), it's just gals working to make people happy and the plot develops from that concept, it's an intentionly simple story, that still has some depth and meaning to it that is highly enjoyable to mine own self.Now the music has to be another top tier part that honestly fits perfectly in every way with this anime. The intro song, the outro song, and all the other funky music? Mmm, chief's kiss!Anyway,  this'll be the first and (hopefully) last review I'll make. Chur. forks yet!).

I gotta say,  I do admire the character Plug with her bubbly personality involving her cute determination and her smart focused sidekick, Arrester. Both girls were pretty likeable and interesting characters for sure! Likewise for their boss, she reminds me of a female All Might from Boku no Hero Academia but without acting all heroic lol!However the biggest downsides of this anime was the fact it had too much pointless fanservice floating about and I didn't like the fact they portrayed the guy who always seem to...attack the girls with a bat. Some might find it funny but I found it wasn't at all funny. I found it uncomfortable and chilling. With regards to the fanservice, I felt it could've been toned down in regards with less sound effects and flashy nudity scenes. I get that it's an ecchi and I wouldn't mind a bit of nudity showing, still it should just chill the f down is all I can ask here.Regards to the plot, it wasnt that special. Character development could be improved on some of the Loli supporting characters by not having nearly all of them as needy crybabies. Plug and Arrester are at least far from that! I wish as well the guy was likeable instead of a nutjob.Anyways that's all I'm gonna say about this unpopular anime but I do recommend peeps to give it a watch regardless of my personal complaints! attack the girls with a bat.

Gilgamesh,https://myanimelist.net/anime/385/Gilgamesh,"[""I can safely say that this is one of the more origianl series that I've had the fortune of seeing. Edgy, dark, and tantilizingly mysterious this series will grip your mind and emotions and squeeze them violently before letting them go. That being said, this is definetly more of an &quot;accquired tase.&quot;~Story~The plot synposis does not in the least do this anime justice. I get the impression that most people who just look at the plot summary provided here will perceive the anime as being something radically different from what it actually is, not to mention it really over-simplifies matters. Let me say that the...intricate story really drives the anime. You don't really know exactly what's going on until the very end, which keeps things exciting but can also be very aggravating. The plot, backstory, and characters themselves are all revealed bit by bit rather than all at once. Certain aspects are given in a straight-forward fashion such as Kazmatsuri's backstory but most everything dealing directly with the main conflict is shrouded in mystery. The show's tagline: &quot;Whose side are you on?&quot; is rather befuddling in that you don't have any concept of the true motivations and natures of the two warring sides until the very end of the anime. While everything seems to boil down to the explosive and twist filled ending, this anime is not one that I found to be end-enduring; in other words, you didn't keep watching solely due to the anticipation of some profound conclusion like you do when watching Witch Hunter Robin. The anime itself was entertaining and each episode self-sustaining.A word of caution: this anime is extremely saturated with symbolism. As such, those with analytical perferences may enjoy it more than those who don't like to delve too deeply into metaphors or philosophy. However, the anime is still rewarding for the latter category...until the end that is. The ending is very in your face symbolic/deeper meaning, and if you're not willing to try and puzzle out what certain things mean in the grand scheme of things, you will feel cheated. I myself initially thought the ending was a total creative cop-out the first time I saw it. After spending hours scouring fan forums, reading the interpretations of fellow fans, and also reading essays on the Epic of Gilgamesh on which the show derives its name and borrows some narrative and thematical elements, I now greatly respect and appreciate the ending. So, if you are unwilling to read up on the Epic of Gilgamesh and discuss the ins and outs of the metaphors snuggled in the ending, I'd warn you to bypass this anime or else risk great disappointment.~Art~The art style was what originally drew me to the series because its so different from anything currently out there. I will admit that it takes some getting used to. The majority of the production is filled with dark, cool color schemes and shies away from pastels and vibrant colors with the excpetion of the color red, which is used liberally to emphasis emotion, passion, violence, and character associations. The character designs are all very distinctive, strong, and unique. They too take some getting used to what with the clumped, sharp looking hair, deep, penetrating eyes, and large lips. The one character who looks incredibly and immediately awesome in the given style is that of The Countess. I am of the opinion that the entire style was implemented just for her character.My one beef with the art of the show is that some of the action sequences are a bit sketchy. It almost seems like certain enouncters are more implied rather than shown, which can be irritating. The degree to which the action sequences are developed fluctuates greatly with some being gorgeously choreographed and others seeming hasty and incomplete.~Sound~From sound effects, to background noises, to in episode music, this anime excels in its ability to sate musical desire. The only bit of music in the series that I would not call high caliber would be the ending theme. My roomie and I had a good laugh at the long standing joke that I could sing just as well as the ending theme singer, and let me just make this painfully clear: I can't sing. At all. It's akin to hearing a cat get run over at high speeds on a mile trek of broken glass. That being said, the ending theme did grow on me. Wether this was due to the immense pleasure I got out of caterwalling along with it each time it played or due to a genuine enjoyment of it, I can't really say. In any event, I recommend joyfully belting out the ending theme each time you get to it for all your neighbors to &quot;enjoy.&quot;~Character~I don't really feel like commenting much on this one. I will tell you that I liked each and every character in the series. Especially Kazmatsuri. At first glance, he's a cold-hearted jerkface. But after you get to know him...he's cold-hearted jerkface. The main reason I love him is specifically for one scene towards the end of the anime. I won't tell you what happens, but look for the episode in which the kids go demand answers from him at his home. My roomie and I about died laughing because of something he does after they leave ( I suppose the humor or lack there of is purely subjective, though, but at least his action is unexpected). Look for it!All in all, this is a delightfully wonderful series. Not for the faint of heart or young of age, mind you. It does get a wee bit violent and generally deals with things in a more mature manner. (It's nowehere near Akira, Elfen Lied, or Hellsing standards though. Meh. I'm venturing it'd be in the PG-13ish range...ish. Some scenes are gorey.). It's not for lovers of things light and fluffy although it does have some preciously fluff filled moments.

One from best anime i've watched - it was like 4/5 times a watched Gilgamesh - like 4 times few years ago, close to 2007 in TV when i was little bit young - and i watched it some time ago again and it still is so goood to watch.Characters are really cool, the good ones and the bad ones - all of them seems really enjoyable to watch - the dark in whole anime with amazing soundtrack (and the piano one "", ""This is probably one of the best shows that no one has seen, yes it can be slow, it's dark and it can be dreary.But to me it was one of the best shows I ever saw. Obviously this is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. First of all this show should definitely be watched in English, the English dub is phenomenal, more specifically the show's dub is generally made better by the addition of Alice Fulks playing the Countess, there was nobody who in my opinion could have played this role, she is a very confusing woman and I think that Alice...herself managed to allow an air of mystery to wash over this character.Anyway, the art of this show is not very vibrant, if you were looking for vibrant and gorgeous colors you will not find it here, a lot of this show has lots of black and white all over it, that might turn people off. But truth be told, I have never seen a dark noir-ish feel pulled off so well since The Big O.The sound for this show is also top notch, there are lots of explosions, lots of teleportation and a good helping of fighting as well.Character Development is key to any show, generally all the important characters evolve in one way or another throughout this show, I can't go into detail how this happens because I would be spoiling and I do not want to do that.This show has been one that was generally ignored and tossed to the scrap pile, with critics complaining that it was dull or dreary, little did they know that if they had bothered to sit though the entire show they would have seen a very tragic story that in my opinion will bring anyone to tears once the show ends. herself managed to allow an air of mystery to wash over this character.Anyway, the art of this show is not very vibrant, if you were looking for vibrant and gorgeous colors you will not find it here, a lot of this show has lots of black and white all over it, that might turn people off.

Well plenty, I checked this out because many anime review sites gave it overwhelmingly positive scores (I mostly check for how the ratings change on a per disc basis and Gilgamesh\'s scores for the most part went up from the first volume to the last). Now, I try not to let other reviews flavor my opinion of what to expect from the show, but at the very least I was expecting something actually good.The story was just horrible, I popped in the first disc and saw the first 5 episodes and found myself with a...reaction I\'d never had before: wtf did I just watch? There have been plenty of times where I pop in the first disc and see the first 4 or 5 episodes and go ""this looks promising, looks like it will improve"" or ""that was average and looks like it\'ll only get worse"" or ""that was great, next disc please!"" or even ""that was god awful, I can\'t believe I even finished the disc"", but this was a resounding ""I\'m not really sure wtf this is, I can\'t even tell if it\'s going to get worse or better"" and that pretty much describes what I felt during my entire viewing of the show. If I hadn\'t paid actual money for it, I probably would have just thrown it away after the first 10 episodes or so. See, from time to time, the series would introduce a single plot idea or point that I thought could lead on to something more interesting, which at the very least kept me watching, only to disappoint me by either just letting it trail off, explaining the plot point away with horrible writing, or just making a mess of it. And it would do this every other episode or so. The characters were slightly better if only because they had to talk to each other. But by no means could I call the characters ""good"", they ended up being as dull and interesting as the plot most of the time with most of the enjoyment coming from being curious about why they have psychic powers (and no, the explanation for that wasn\'t good either). It was nice to see the four teens act like teens from time to time and that was clearly where they were the most interesting and had some capacity to develop and watching the show didn\'t feel like a chore, but in the end both the characters and story just felt like an unrewarding mess. It was like being teased with a $100 bill on the end of a fishing rod and chasing it in hopes of getting it only to find out that it\'s a $1 when you finally get it after all that effort. The ending was clearly the $1 bill here and I\'ve heard that the ending is love it/hate it type (although I really say that about the entire series) and in my case I didn\'t enjoy the hurried explanations of the plot points and the sudden introduction of characters like the writers thought the audience was actually expecting them to appear all of 10 minutes before the end of the show and deus ex machina everything to death. The series just failed at every emotional turn that could\'ve turned out well, there was a particular incident about 3/4 of the way through the series that could have been very emotional and perhaps would have made me hate watching this less if they didn\'t feel the need to make what happens afterwards with it so incredibly creepy and nonsensical. Nonsensical is certainly a word I\'d use to describe this, sure anime is rarely based in any sort of recognizable reality, it\'s just the nature of the medium and you can get all sorts of incredibly innovative and great things without having them necessarily make perfect sense when applied to the real world, but sometimes even suspending your belief won\'t help because it still makes no sense internally within the show itself and that is certainly one of (but by no means the only) probably with the entire script: no one checked it for logic at any given point. Now, you\'ll be able to follow along with this pretty well, the script isn\'t that over the top hard to follow, but you\'ll end up questioning every revelation the show makes anyway because it\'s honestly difficult to see where most of the conclusions come from.I\'ll give credit where it is due though, sound was pretty good, meaning mostly music here. Sure, the dub was competent, but it sure didn\'t make me care anymore for the show. Unfortunately, the fairly catching opening (combined with good reviews for it in the A range) was what made me buy this hunk of junk in the first place so while it may be pretty good, you might as well call it false advertisement because the show will never be half as good or interesting as either its OP or its score in general. I\'ve still heard better though and it\'s hardly worth watching just for that. Art\'s another mixed bag, I kind of hated it, you could see cheap animation cuts in every single fight, but a few things were done fairly well from time to time. Character designs just creeped me out, but I\'ll admit I don\'t watch too many shows with designs at all bishonen like. You might get more mileage out of it, but it also would have helped if everyone didn\'t always constantly wear the exact same facial expression at all times.Overall, I give this a 4 out of 10. It has just enough going for it to not actually slip off into the realm of the truly horrible but at the same time it\'s never going to be good enough to be anything more than bad-average and it\'s certainly not worth rewatching. A few episodes went by pretty quickly for me, but overall, it kind of felt like getting your teeth pulled, you can always use anesthesia to help it along, but it\'s pretty painful all the same. reaction I\'d never had before: wtf did I just watch? There have been plenty of times where I pop in the first disc and see the first 4 or 5 episodes and go ""this looks promising, looks like it will improve"" or ""that was average and looks like it\'ll only get worse"" or ""that was great, next disc please!"" or even ""that was god awful, I can\'t believe I even finished the disc"", but this was a resounding ""I\'m not really sure wtf this is, I can\'t even tell if it\'s going to get worse or better"" and that pretty much describes what I felt during my entire viewing of the show. If I hadn\'t paid actual money for it, I probably would have just thrown it away after the first 10 episodes or so. See, from time to time, the series would introduce a single plot idea or point that I thought could lead on to something more interesting, which at the very least kept me watching, only to disappoint me by either just letting it trail off, explaining the plot point away with horrible writing, or just making a mess of it. And it would do this every other episode or so. The characters were slightly better if only because they had to talk to each other. But by no means could I call the characters ""good"", they ended up being as dull and interesting as the plot most of the time with most of the enjoyment coming from being curious about why they have psychic powers (and no, the explanation for that wasn\'t good either). It was nice to see the four teens act like teens from time to time and that was clearly where they were the most interesting and had some capacity to develop and watching the show didn\'t feel like a chore, but in the end both the characters and story just felt like an unrewarding mess. It was like being teased with a $100 bill on the end of a fishing rod and chasing it in hopes of getting it only to find out that it\'s a $1 when you finally get it after all that effort. The ending was clearly the $1 bill here and I\'ve heard that the ending is love it/hate it type (although I really say that about the entire series) and in my case I didn\'t enjoy the hurried explanations of the plot points and the sudden introduction of characters like the writers thought the audience was actually expecting them to appear all of 10 minutes before the end of the show and deus ex machina everything to death. The series just failed at every emotional turn that could\'ve turned out well, there was a particular incident about 3/4 of the way through the series that could have been very emotional and perhaps would have made me hate watching this less if they didn\'t feel the need to make what happens afterwards with it so incredibly creepy and nonsensical.

I cant believe i sat through it all, watching every episode waiting for something to happen. All i got was lame aliens and genocide.I feel almost as disappointed in this anime as i did in the dragonball movie. ', ""This is an epic story that is beautifully drawn and designed.  It is very dark and more than a little depressing, but mostly it is emotionally involving.There are a lot of anime characters whom I could calmly watch being dismembered -- because I don't care about them.  But the characters in Gilgamesh are emotionally engaging.  I believed in their stories, and when they felt pain, it was a big deal to me.In feel, it's a bit like Texhnolyze.  Ergo Proxy has some mood similarities but is a very different show.In visual style, few shows come close....Perhaps Witch Hunter Robin is a rival for visual beauty. Perhaps Witch Hunter Robin is a rival for visual beauty."", ""Sorry, Mario, but the King of Heroes is in another anime. =DGilgamesh was probably one of the first five anime I watched in Japanese. The third, I believe...Yu-Gi-Oh! GX would have been first and Death Note second. So it holds a special place in my heart - not a good place by any means, but still.As I said, Gilgamesh was one of the first anime I watched, and at the time I found it very strange and confusing, particularly in regards to the ending. Now that I'm older, wiser, and handsomer (and have watched many more anime), it makes perfect sense to me.Gilgamesh is a...quick, desperate Evangelion rip-off...is what I thought until this very moment, when I checked its dates. The manga is from 1976-78, and the anime is from 2003 (that's a pretty massive gap...). I could have sworn Gilgamesh came out in 1999 (putting it only a bit over a year after the release of End of Evangelion). Great. Now I have to restructure this whole review.Even if it's not literally an Evangelion rip-off, the superficial similarities are striking. A semi-post-apocalyptic setting. Usage of classical music. A group of children vs. an alien threat. Usage of nonsensical technology. The endings are even somewhat similar. In fact, here's how you can make your very own Gilgamesh:1. Take an Evangelion (any one will do, just make sure it's not a Rebuild).2. Remove the mechs.3. Remove the psychological analysis.4. Make the Angels basically human, and don't kill any of them off. Just have the characters fight them repeatedly.5. Pour a bunch of black and grey paint on everything so it looks boring.6. ???7. PROFIT?So I can wrap up my general thoughts by saying that if you did not like Evangelion, you won't like this. If you did like Evangelion, then you should have the sophistication to not like this. Okay, let's move on!Story! I watched this more than four years ago, so my memories of this are a bit sketchy. The premise and some of the material revealed in the first act is decent, but the second act stagnates and the third simply dips into absurdity (imagine the overarching plot of Evangelion, except that neither SEELE nor their plans has ever been mentioned before this point). It's pretty clear no one working on this made any attempt to join the events of each episode together into a meaningful whole.Art! Gilgamesh's art is not very good. If I were to describe the style, I'd say it's rather similar to Serial Experiments Lain, except less colorful and (due to being made five years later) smoother. Like Lain, characters have poses where they look good, and poses where they look awful. Except in Lain I think that was intentional. Here, they're just off-model. The animation budget was clearly limited, as the battles are brief and movement in general is avoided where possible.Sound! I tend to not remember soundtracks unless they're really striking. Or, put another way, if I like the show, I'll notice the soundtrack. In case you didn't notice, I didn't like Gilgamesh. The opening song is good, or at least entertaining - Wait! That's another thing it has in common with Evangelion! An addictive opening song! However, Cruel Angel's Thesis this is not. It also doesn't fit with the show, like...at all.I don't recall much of anything in regards to the voice acting (as a reminder, I watched it subbed). In fact, it might have been pretty weak, but since I don't remember it, I can't comment on it.Characters! Like I said in regards to story, everything in Gilgamesh is extremely disjointed. As I recall, this applies to its characters as well, who are kind of arbitrarily characterized on an episode-by-episode basis (if you've seen Kaze no Stigma, you know what I mean). My memory is a bit too hazy for details (why I am I even writing this review, then?), so we'll go with that.Enjoyment! I watched to the end. That's something. Would I watch to the end now?

As far as an engaging plot, the surface plot is a bit lacking but the plot twists and character engagements are absolutely first rate. It's an easy watch, but do NOT watch this thing dubbed. The english voice actors are horrid, and I mean HORRID - they will completely ruin it for you. I liked the art because it was so unique, but I know a few people who are so turned off by it that they couldn't even watch the show. The soundrack is perfect for the show. "", ""I'm writing this review because I see so many people praising this ''shit''.And this is just a warning to those who are about to waste a lot of precious time.I got drawn to this anime because of the title.Gilgamesh is an ancient Mesopotamian king written about in the Gilgamesh Epic (Epic of Gilgamesh) which has been dated as the oldest and therefor first piece of great literary work.Well that sounds awesome doesn't it?Too bad the anime doesn't even come close to it....This whole anime is some sort of postapocaliptic style story about good vs. bad with 2 kids caught in the middle. not really anything special in my opinion but none the less I started watching it. I soon came to realize that it was a grave error that has caused me to waste precious time I will never get back and I dropped the series.Story:The plot isn't all that bad, well it's definitely not good, but it's mediocre.The way that it's told however is rather boring and played out even though this is an old anime.Like I said post-apocalyptic world with Good vs. Evil and 2 kids in the middle. They are the children of the one guy that actually put the world in it's current position. They are hunted down by a group called gilgamesh and taken in by a count that fights gilgamesh through a bunch of other kids with telekinetic type powers. this is where it goes wrong. all the fights are fought through these powers and it's just lame.Art:The art work is plain, totally uninspired and lackluster. The graphics are terrible and there's allmost no motion. It's like watching an anime from one still to the other. Character movements are minimal, and poor, the background is played out, and poor. it really offers nothing. this is probably the main reason why the anime is so boring. because if the art and graphics/motions were dope the anime might have been much cooler. the telekinetic fight scenes, the explosions and wall crumbling scenes all are so minimal in detail etc. that it just doesn't amaze you in the slightest bit.Sound:There's nothing much to be said about the sound. it' s nothing special, any mediocre anime this would have been okay.. it doesn't uplift the anime, but it also doesn't enhance it.Character:Just really played out again. The characters look lame with a lack of detail. The hair and faces for instance really looks horrible in this anime. the background stories are also not really deep and not really interesting. it's allmost as if the makers of this anime didn't really wan't to make it.As if they were terribly underpaid and went like '' ok if that's how it's going to be.. scribble scribble.. ok done, yeh we know this looks horrible... but fuck you, pay us now, we don't care if you release it''Enjoyment:it made me sigh a lot.... like*sigh* ... why am I watching this?*pfff* am I really watching this?**ungh* i'm gonna stop watching this...*ehh* i'm still watching this*clicks stop* ahh finally free!!!Overall:do yourself a favourDON'T WATCH THIS!!!thank you This whole anime is some sort of postapocaliptic style story about good vs. bad with 2 kids caught in the middle. not really anything special in my opinion but none the less I started watching it.

For some people it’s the story, a lot of people enjoy anime for its artistic (visual specifically) merits. How the characters interact, what kind of characters they are and what kind of adventures they have. Some people enjoy their anime with an air of mystery and complexity, something a little darker, edgier, something that makes you think or something that makes you feel.Gilgamesh contains absolutely none of this. In a sense it’s good at catching you by surprise in that...sense since you don’t get what you’re expecting to get going into it; because you actually expect it to deliver something, but it doesn’t. If there is one thing positive that I took from Gilgamesh it’s that you can never judge a book by its cover, or its premise. Because Gilgamesh actually does have an allure to its art and it does have an interesting set up. Because of a scientific catastrophe, the sky has become a mirror, electronic media is no longer functioning and children born after the event have strange psycho-kinetic abilities. It sounds really interesting. However from the very first episode, it never appears to be a very riveting tale, everything from the acting, the soundtrack, the colour palate and the animation itself do absolutely nothing.While the acting is actually the shows strongest point for the most part, that’s saying very little, because everything else is so incredibly bad. Immediately, the most striking feature of the show is its bland and grey colour and atmosphere (with the occasional splash of red, livid blue, brown and yellow, which might I add are all very depthless in tone). While this atmosphere is kind of cool in the beginning, it gets tired by about the third episode and it never gets any more exciting.The animation and the character design is ghastly. Nearly all of the characters have these odd fish faces and they move very stiffly and plainly. You’d expect that there’d be all these exciting fights between the psycho-kinetic kids, throwing each other about with their minds, hurling energy at each other in big, bloody and moving mind-brawls. The Gilgamesh kids even have a transformation that is seldom ever used (and looks super goofy), but here’s the deal. There are quite a few fights sure, but 90% of them is just throwing up energy shields and teleporting, with the villains usually retreating after a couple of attacks. The animation is very lazy, the voice acting and sfx are half-assed and the fights add absolutely nothing to the show. They don’t make it any more interesting or exciting, they’re just there. I’m not going to say an awful lot about the soundtrack, since I can say it all very briefly here: it’s hilariously cheesy and bad, that’s all you need to know about that. You’ll barely even notice it’s playing (the opening theme is also awful and does not set the show up at all).So the art and sound is super bad, how about the story and the characters involved? Nope, just as bad, if not worse. The biggest offenders are the villains, who have a vaguely explained motives and a goal that doesn’t actually end up achieving anything. Oh, also they don’t seem to actually have any motive aside from wrecking the only chance of returning the planet to normal for nearly two thirds  of the entire show (SPOILER! And since they actually manage to accomplish this, the first half of the show builds up to nothing and then fizzles out SPOILER!). most of this shows story is just why? Why are they doing this? Why do they want this? Why does the main character have a romantic interest in his older sister? Wait… hold up. Yes, it is apparent that the main character is in love with his sister and if this was not the intention, the real intention was poorly conveyed. He even turns down another love interest just to pursue his sister. (SPOILER! Oh no, but it’s ok because we later find out that he’s a clone of their father, so she’s more genetically his daughter rather than his sister, so that makes it better since she looks a lot like their mother. Hold up… does that make it better? I don’t think it does, no matter how you look at it, they’re either brother and sister or father and daughter SPOILER!). The characters are all just as boring as the art and animation. Clingy younger brother, over bearing older sister, cool older male supporting role, comic relief male supporting role, love interest female supporting role, androgynous character, mysterious anti-hero that slowly becomes likeable, cold adult character, personality-less cronies; and that’s all they ever are. The characters are never more than their assigned roles, you’ve pretty much met all of these characters before.I won’t ruin the ending if you’re still keen to watch this pretentious trite, but let me just warn you to be careful not to cut yourself on the edge, because it’s super edgy and 3deep5you and you probably just won’t get it.So, in summary, Gilgamesh is a boring, inane, tiresome and pretentious excuse for anime. The sort of thing that people that would like to think that they have sophisticated and mature taste in anime like to pretend is super cool because almost no one has seen it(not saying my own taste isn’t any better than anyone else’s but you know what I mean). I cannot in good faith recommend that you waste your time watching this, because this is super uninteresting and is not what you’re looking for if you’re after an artsy psychological anime with an interesting message. It is also not a super obscure action anime with cool powers and strong characters.

"", ""Damn. Definitely had me sitting at the edge of my couch in silence for a long while after I finished it.This is an anime I came across by chance, by digging deep. I mean DEEP. I've never heard a soul talk about it, nor can you hardly find anything about it online, which is crazy to me. I'm in multiple anime related fb groups with millions of followers and not ONCE was this anime ever posted about (that's wild, cuz they have EVERYTHING). So its definitely a hidden gem.I'm pretty critical when it comes to what I watch, I'll judge every little thing and I've...dropped so many animes over 'ugly artwork' without even giving them a chance...and to be honest, I almost dropped this one too. But I'm glad I stayed to the end. It had me staying up past 5am clicking 'next episode' because I HAD to know what was happening next.Honestly, if you can power through and ignore the animation quality in the beginning, its worth it (at least in my opinion).

This show does so much shit at such a low budget that it\'s not even remotely surprising that some of it is very messy. This show belongs to a sub genre of television that is meant to be watched at around 13 years old. The internet is down, the tv is shit and you\'re running a high fever. This allows you to truly comprehend the show emotionally but completely fail to understand it intellectually. You wake up the next day slightly traumatized and maybe with a fetish for a...specific kind of white woman.Anyways this show is a tragedy, steampunk, post-apocalyptic, gothic, mystery, thriller. That\'s a lotta shit. The show\'s about a cult who purport themselves as the ""gilgamesh"" meddling with the world order, as you may have guess they are up to some serious fuckshit. Some kind of geomagnetic fuckshit has made the sky a mirror that prevents all computer electronics from working.The style of the show is very unique, it has a supremely suffocating muted art style that feels inspired by a french noir movie. Fitting with the setting they chose a soundtrack that feels like it\'s taken out of an old ass scooby doo episode or star trek or some shit. Like it\'s all big band stuff with horns and fluts and shit.The main character\'s are pretty solid. The countess is one of the best renditions of ice cold bitch I\'ve ever seen. The main character is a biiiiittt mid though. (the fits are fucking fire too)The lore is just god damn excellent, it\'s like neon genisis evangelion except it\'s exposition isn\'t bloody nonsense, mixed with some Nier like mystery. (the 11th episode i swear is some nier shit)Alright boys, it\'s time for the bad.1. the gilgamesh are a bit underdeveloped. I can tell purely from their design and how they position themselves what they are meant to be , but their motivations, personalities and organization in general is left pretty much untouched.2. some characterization is kind of clumsy especially near the end.3. the final episode is rushed to hell, imagine the end of evangelion if it was only 2 epiodes. (wait, we got that and it fuckign sucked)4. a lot of animation is not great, especially in fightsall an all this shit is at least an 8 out of 10. i honestly think most of the issues were budget related.

It almost exclusively focuses on a small group of adolescents with identical sets of basic superpowers (them being nondescript is actually a positive feature of the series in adding...a level of realism to the story), who are taken in by an enigmatic wealthy women in order to defeat a band of people possessing demonic abilities who are intent on carrying out the terrorist’s still-destructive will. Obviously given the magnitude of the initial incident—which was in fact caused by the leader alone— the enemy pose the biggest threat the world has seen. Seemingly however there are only two other groups seeking to oppose them: a scientific institution hoping to rectify the existing ailments, and a special forces unit working in parallel to the adolescents. Furthermore in the simplification of the plot and the dilution of the intended tone, the adolescents only sporadically engage with the enemy who appear very indecisive in large parts of the show. Consequently this means that the main characters spend a lot of the time idling—mostly in one place as well through being somewhat detached from the outside world—where in these periods awkward sexual relationships are usually established.With having not just the exceptionally stretched plot, but also visuals that beyond the character designs are crude— even when taking into account its age— and an irksome soundtrack, this is a shabby production.

Those people that enjoy a story told with all the cards on the table likely wont enjoy this show as much as those who like to keep guessing whats really going on. The line of ""bad guys"" and ""good guys"" is never clearly defined. The plot line really does a great job of allowing you to either like or dislike the protagonists or the antagonist by keeping much of their motives hidden until the end.Music:Some great classical works from Beethoven and others meld right...in and feel like the belong. The characters even build a connection with the musical scores on a level that is not often seen in most other anime.Characters:Those that like steady and progressive character development will notice it lacking here. Many of the characters don\'t know anything about their past and those that do keep it hidden. By the time you can fully appreciate who the character really are the series is just about warping up. Don\'t let this alone keep you from watching the show as the characters do have personality and are easy to become attached to.Overall:Anyone who enjoys trying to figure out what really going on or does not like to be spoon fed the answers will enjoy the Gilgamesh series. in and feel like the belong.

I\'ve finished this series in four days, but what the hell?  In retrospect, I will always suggest watching the first two or three episodes of an anime before you decide to drop it.  For Gilgamesh, the first three episodes were in a strikingly beautiful gothic-noire style with high levels of tensions fitting of Edgar Allan Poe.  The science theme is incorporated later on and remains.  Bits of pieces of information and of the past come together and at around episode 10/25 all the pieces come together.Psi-fighting, transforming monsters, transgenics, guns, sibling love,...adopted family, and love that trespasses differences of species all fill the 26 episodes of this series.  Sure the general storyline is pretty goodish (the reason why I gave this a one will become apparent later), and the only REAL problem was the excessive re-using of scenes.Everything you really need to know is: The Countess with her psychic-wielding children and her ex-lover fight each other to bring their own ""peace"" to the universe.Now where did everything go wrong?  What killed this series with a -9DMG hit to its score?  By episode 25 I was pretty curious as to how this series would end.  Would it have been possible?  Let me quote one character in the last episode:""It looks like this foolish badly written play is finally at an end""I think I have been laughing through the last episode due to how terribly ironic, laughable, and depressing it was.

What to say about this anime that wouldn\'t do it a disservice? How often do you find plots that blend one of the oldest myths of all time, a futuristic plot, a tragedy, a mildly incestuous brother/sister relationship that is not only noticed but lightly mocked by the other characters? As well as totally denying the viewer any real insight into either the main antagonists, the shadowy scientist that exists behind them, the true origin, or exactly what happens when its all over!Did that confuse you? It\'s okay if it did. Rest easy in the knowledge that this anime provides characters that are totally,...tragically flawed, but also totally believable, relate-able, and human. The entire time I was watching this series (which I did in about 1.5 days, since once you pop, you just can\'t stop) I kept thinking, ""when/where is the deus ex machina? What is going to save these characters (as usually happens in Western writing) that are clearly only experiencing this much pain to make the catharsis at the end more satisfying? Right?"" WRONG. And I have never enjoyed being so wrong so much.This anime, more than the beautiful animation, the haunting characters, or the awesome fights, makes use of a wonderfully unique and different plot. If Death Note is a good benchmark for taking a new idea to its logical, fleshed out conclusion, then Gilgamesh should be the benchmark for creating the most ridiculous, most believable, least informative (and yet totally, amazingly entertain) story that really could be delivered in just 26 episodes. tragically flawed, but also totally believable, relate-able, and human.

It does however require some patience as it starts off pretty slowly and maintains a slow pace throughout.What I likedOne of the main things I liked about the show was how it seemed so generic in the first 2 episodes (its teenagers with superpowers fighting other super-powered teenagers) but then managed to do some unique and interesting things. First off while it does seem like your standard good vs evil story , the characters themselves don\'t really fit into the...good-guy/bad-guy roles.  Isamu, Fuko and Tohru who are the ""good-guys"" are not your altruistic goody two shoes heroes who are trying to save the world. Their main reason for fighting Gilgamesh is that they don\'t have anything better to do. Initially they don\'t seem to really care about anything , Isamu in particular is a very stoic apathetic character, but as the series progresses they develop nicely into quite likable characters. The countess who leads this group also does not fall into the good-guy character and in many scenes is an out-and-out bitch. Her reasons for using the children to fight Gilgamesh are entirely self-serving and she does not care about saving the world. The countess is by far the most interesting character here as she can come across as a cold hearted bitch in one scene and later on we see her as a lonely woman who is a slave to her past and at times you feel sympathy and compassion for her.  Likewise those on the side of Gilgamesh, while technically villains, are not what you would call evil and in their own way are trying to save humanity.The art style is also really good. The world of Gilgamesh with its sherltering sky and such is not a happy place and the art style really gets that point across with a load of dark colors and shades and everything has a real goth feel to it.And lastly while the plot moves at quite a slow pace there is a good story here and a quite interesting ending.What I didn\'t likeAlas not all is good with this show. There are some real flaws and one big one in particular. That main flaw being that while at its core this is a good vs evil story very little time is spent developing the characters on the Gilgamesh side. Other than appearing in battles we never get to see them and the main villain, Enkidu, does not even show up until very late in the series. This was such a missed opportunity as some of the members of Gilgamesh look really badass and from the glimpses of their personality they seem really interesting characters. The show would really have benefited from spending some more time developing the members of Gilgamesh.Another thing I did not like was the battles and action scenes. They are not bad per say just very generic and not that fun to watch.ConclusionOverall I liked Gilgamesh. It is not going to break any new ground and its overly dark, depressing tone and art style can be off-putting at times and the pacing of the story could have been better.

Though this genericness is not felt at all, as the series goes out of its way to distinguish itself. Most of the characters are amoral and self-interested, not the usual pure heroes vs villains horse shit. Most of the focus is on character interactions - kind of like a slice of life, except with infinitely more edge and higher stakes.Yes, Gilgamesh is very edgy. That is not necessarily a bad thing (e.g. Ergo Proxy),...but the execution is not on point. Some of the characters look too ridiculous - particularly those of the villains. This can be pulled off if the designs are properly ridiculed, but unfortunately they did not take this opportunity. Some of the edginess is very entertaining - the incest, age gap things... though this is a little spoiled by the meme-tier edge that looms over the series.The art looks a little off to me, but it adds flair and communicates the intended atmosphere well. The animation is low quality, full of still frames and mediocre motion. The fight scenes are very poor: the choreography is uninspiring, the abilities and action of the characters feel arbitrary and suited to whatever moves the plot. The sound volume is very inconsistent, with character voices being too quiet, sound effects being too loud, and shouting being too loud.The characters feel very bland to me, particularly the villains and the brown haired boys. The others are fine for the most part, with the main girl being a personal favorite of mine. Unfortunately, she doesn\'t get that much screen time. This blandness is a particular issue as character interaction is a focus point of the series.The ""final conflict"" was also poorly planned and rushed - basically everything happens in the last episode. The underlying idea/conflict is very interesting: whether it is worth it to rearrange/destroy/change the world to accommodate a supposedly superior lifeform. This has links to a lot of pressing and interesting conflicts: eugenics, genocide, ship of theseus, utilitarianism vs deontology... Yet as they have crammed this entire idea into the last fking episode none of it could be properly explored.Overall, this feels like something that could have been very good, but due to issues with creative skill and production value it regresses to mediocrity.
