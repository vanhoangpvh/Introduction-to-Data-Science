Sekai no Owari ni Shiba Inu to,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52020/Sekai_no_Owari_ni_Shiba_Inu_to,"[""At heart, Doomsday with my Dog is a comedy show. Initially I was drawn in by its name and the prospect of venturing through the remains of a destroyed world much like in Girls' Last Tour, but the show places much more emphasis on the day-to-day ramblings of the main cast, which ends up creating a much more light-hearted atmosphere than one might expect.We follow an unnamed girl - the last human alive - and her talking dog - Haru - as they wander aimlessly about in the apocalypse. The dynamic between Haru and the girl resembles the classic Japanese comedy roles of boke and...tsukkomi respectively, with Haru often making puns, begging for food, or simply being a lovable goofball. The girl is more level-headed and provides the metaphorical hammer that hits Haru over the head when he goes too far. A cast of side characters pop up here and there - more dogs, for example - but there are never any humans for obvious reasons. They add some flavour to the comedy and the philosophical discussions they have are genuinely thought-provoking and insightful, as well as being funny.A lot of the jokes are aimed at a Japanese audience and as such there are references to Japanese folk tales and traditional beliefs that a an unfamiliar viewer might struggle to understand, but the show uses its visuals and the pair's commentary to provide enough context for it to make sense. Each episode is extremely short and consists of multiple skits, so a joke never overstays its welcome, though because of this, it's sometimes too fast for a skit to be fully developed.Its animation is its most unique aspect - it basically looks like a manga. A still, clearly hand-drawn frame stays on screen for several seconds, with perhaps only the mouth moving, and massive speech bubbles with huge text inside them. It makes the show feel very static and doesn't lend itself to immersion, as the text takes up a good 25-75% of the screen most of the time. It's hard to tell where the main cast actually is, but usually that doesn't matter, since the focus is on the dialogue, not the setting.Speaking of the setting, there is absolutely no worldbuilding to speak of nor is there any mystery as to what the world-ending event was. This is in stark contrast to shows such as the aforementioned Girls' Last Tour and Dr Stone but I think this is irrelevant. The setting is seldom important to the jokes or plot and could honestly be set on the moon or in a high-school and still make just as much sense.Overall if you want a simple short-form comedy show with a hint of adventure, then this is perfect, but if you're looking for a more gritty tale about life after the end-of-the-world, then this is not the show you are looking for. tsukkomi respectively, with Haru often making puns, begging for food, or simply being a lovable goofball.

From the very first episode, the show manages to capture the audience's attention with its unique post-apocalyptic setting and relatable characters.One of the standout aspects of Doomsday with My Dog is the relationship between the main character, Master, and her faithful companion, Haru-san. Haru-san is not just a pet; he is a loyal friend and an essential member of Master's survival team. The show beautifully portrays the bond between Master and Haru-san and their unwavering determination...to stay together, no matter what challenges come their way and the uses of funny segments on what happens along the journey through a post-apocalyptic world.Another impressive aspect of Doomsday with My Dog is the animation art style looking very manga-eques like. The show's artwork is stunning, with beautiful backgrounds and strange campions Master finds in her journey. The animation is fluid as the only thing is moving is the mouth going up and down for 90% of the time but that's what gives doomsday with my dog its vibe, keeping the audience engaged throughout.The story of Doomsday with My Dog is also compelling. It does an excellent job of balancing the emotional and action-packed moments, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. The show's pacing is excellent, and each episode leaves you wanting more being as of them being a minute long majority of the time.Finally, the backgrounds and environments in the anime may contain details that are easy to overlook. Post-apocalyptic settings are often filled with ruins and debris that can be used to tell a story about the world that the characters inhabit. Paying attention to the details in the backgrounds can add depth and richness to the world of the anime.Overall, Doomsday with My Dog is an exceptional anime that is sure to delight audiences of all ages. Its heart-warming story, stunning animation, and memorable characters make it a must-watch for any anime fan.

Rizelmine,https://myanimelist.net/anime/197/Rizelmine,"[""When my friend recommended this to me I thought to myself &quot;well, she's usually pretty good when it comes to anime, maybe I'll give Rizelmine a little shot.&quot;  I'm not going to trust my friend so easily again.Story: What story?  Each episode is only 14 minutes long which came as a shock, but the entire series is 26 episodes long.  Now if you convert that to 24 minute episodes it's only about 18.  The story is really....annoying, and they only really try to build on it during the second half of the anime.  The story seems forced and contrived, and...doesn't seem to have any point at all except to show that the writers ran out of ways for Tomonori to throw Rizel at a wall/post/house.Art: I wasn't impressed by the art, mind you I might have just have had low quality videos.  The art doesn't detract from the anime, because the anime doesn't really have anything going for it.  They never really try to do anything with it either, it's the same art the entire way through, which is slightly dissapointing.  There's also some scenes where they tried to give the artist some freedoms to do something really cool, but the artists don't leap at the chance.  There are also explosions almost every episode, and they're incredibly pink, which is also really irritating.Sound: Terrible.  The only saving grace in the sound is the opening music.  Even the opening song is terrible, but I still found myself listening to it almost every other episode.Character: Tomonori......He likes older women, and he's incredibly abusive.  Oh...and stubborn....and stupid.  Those are all of his amazing character traits.  Rizel is clumsy, annoying, persistant, and loves to cry.  When you add them together you get comedy...right?  For the first couple episodes having Rizel being flung into walls and other things seems kind of entertaining...After episode 4 it gets REALLY old incredibly quickly.  And that's pretty much all the humor, they try to do some other tricks, but that's it.  Even Papa A, B, and C get old and stale.  There's nothing fun about these characters, They never really grow unless they're forced to, which is slightly dissapointing.Enjoyment: I didn't like this anime at all.  In the first episode I thought it was incredible, I was really enjoying it.  After the fourth I was hoping they were going to switch it up a little.  When they finally introduce other characters and a story I was already overwhelmingly bored with it all.  Even the fact that it's 14 minutes per episode doesn't save it.  A full 26 episodes long (which is supposed to be 2 seasons) still makes it way too long.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Not even ecchi fans who can't watch anything with a story.  I'm pretty sure this would bore even them.  Even if you've finished an incredibly draining series I wouldn't ask anyone to watch this. doesn't seem to have any point at all except to show that the writers ran out of ways for Tomonori to throw Rizel at a wall/post/house.Art: I wasn't impressed by the art, mind you I might have just have had low quality videos.

I watched this all the way through and rather enjoyed it.Story: While stereotypical, it was an amusing romp. The individual episodes go fairly quickly and keep it at a decent pace. Some of the stuff comes from left field, which makes it a bit fun. There is comedy, romance, and good hearted fun.Art/Sound: It's drawn in a &quot;modern&quot; style, not 90's or large eyes. The Ecchi is fairly tame, and its not all little girl.Character: The interaction between the characters was pretty amusing. Standouts include the main girl herself, and her Pappa/Mamma guardians...slash researchers.Why I would recommend watching it: You can finsh this off easily on a weekday, there aren't that many boring spots as it goes fairly quickly. It's a refreshing adventure that you can put in between other anime's. slash researchers.Why I would recommend watching it: You can finsh this off easily on a weekday, there aren't that many boring spots as it goes fairly quickly.

This anime is about that kind of boy.Not sure what kind of person it takes to create a main character bordering on sociopath with no redeeming features and have him constantly abuse a poor girl until she cries but someone thought that would make a great anime. I think it\'s sickening. The entire story is complete trash, nothing can justify this horrid shit.The only passable elements would be ""everything except the story and the main guy"", I did laugh at a few jokes...so there\'s that. so there\'s that.', ""So i'll keep my review short as I can cause if your like me you might have a short attention span. Rizelmine holds a special part of me mainly cause it introduce some of my favorite voice actors. Specifically Rie Kugimiya and Yamaguchi Kappei. If you don't recognize these names Kappei is know for voicing Ussop from One Piece and Rie pretty much holds the title of tsundere queen for her roles as Louise from Zero No Tsukaima, Taiga From Toradora, Aria From Hidan No Aria you get my point. Now the story is pretty unique even for today's standards but even so its not...something that everyone might enjoy. The characters are fairly enjoyable to watch, especially Rizel  cause of how cute she is and how hard she works for her husband. Tomonori can be an annoying prick and kind of a scum bag but he's only a middle school kid who is still growing as a person and in the end I quite like how he developed as a character towards the end of the anime. Now as far as cliches go I want to point out that this anime is pretty old as it came out in 2002 so yes it has cliches but when this anime was made these cliches weren't as known and were more acceptable back then. So what do I think of this anime? Its alright, If you need something with cute romance and some light comedy then this might be something to try out. I wanna apologize for this review being a mess, writing isn't something i'm good at but I hope this review helped none the less something that everyone might enjoy.

Shadow Skill,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3005/Shadow_Skill,"['Unless you are a hardcore ""Shadow Skill"" or \'shonen fighting\' fan, I have a hard time seeing how someone might enjoy this. It\'s not unforgivably terrible, but a lot of the elements in it are generally generic. It has all the classic fighting staples (such as learning more about others and oneself through fists rather than words) and it also possesses plenty of the exaggerated combat cliches one might be familiar with in this genre (such as destroying the surrounding landscape and gushing fountains of blood).Unfortunately there are also disproportionate amounts of awkward exposition which don\'t lend themselves well to this kind of anime. Most...people watching this kind of show probably want lots of action with healthy doses of plot and history introduced gradually. There are some interesting aspects to Shadow Skill (such as its magic system and special techniques), but this OVA does a mediocre job at best at developing them.The characters are kind of rushed/forced, and the supporting characters are reduced to the roles of mysterious inexplicable cameos.The animation is ok although it can look rather unappealing at times.The music wasn\'t memorable and the dubbing is some of the worst I\'ve heard, down there with Silent Mobius.Finally, despite the fact that it is called Epilogue, it appears that this OVA somehow comes before the proceeding one, oddly enough. Furthermore, epilogues are usually a conclusion of some sort, so not only does this OVA have nothing to do with the other one, it also doesn\'t really conclude anything... people watching this kind of show probably want lots of action with healthy doses of plot and history introduced gradually.

I saw it back in 1999 on a videotape together with the movie and enjoyed it somewhat.Animationwise it still had the same look like the movie was, and the story was´nt bad at all , something different that all that constant fighting.It also shows the personal inside struggle of Gau ban and ELLe Ragu, 2 protagonists, like  a person has in its everyday...life. The characters itself are maybe a bit slow at the beginning an uninterested but they make it up with some nice fightscenes and interesting technique´s wich is.nt too hard to execute and ofc fitting music as a add-on.

It involves the idiot squad or whatever they were calling themselves going on or trying to go on a trip together and continually messing it up along the way. There's characters being portrayed as overly stupid for comedic effect and then there's characters just being as stupid as the plot needs them to be so the misunderstandings can happen.

Koukyoushihen Eureka Seven Hi-Evolution 3: Eureka,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35136/Koukyoushihen_Eureka_Seven_Hi-Evolution_3__Eureka,"[""If you’ve seen me on Mal before, or you visit my profile after reading this, you’ll quickly realize that Eureka Seven is my favourite anime of all time. It’s pretty easy to see, cause, you know, it’s at the top of my favourites list and all. I found Eureka Seven at a pretty important time in my life, and proceeded to fall so deeply in love with almost everything about it, that I watched all 50 episodes over the course of three days. I was that entranced with it. I have never, in my life, cried as much as I did when I was watching...that show, and it wasn’t sad crying either, it was happy crying—the best type of crying because it really feels like you’re emotionally decompressing everything. It’s the type of crying where the tears feel like they’re staining your skin; the type of crying where you can feel a lump in your throat, and it hurts. The raw, human sincerity, and pure, emotional honesty of the cast resonated with me, deeply, in a way nothing had managed before, and in a way nothing has managed since. These characters were human, just like me, and they had flaws, just like me, and even if they weren’t actually human—even if they were different—they experienced life all the same. Watching Eureka Seven gave me an emotional catharsis I have hitherto never, in my life, experienced with media, so, I knew it was special. After rewatching it later that year, it became my favourite, and I swear by it to this day. And of course, when something becomes your favourite, you naturally want to check out everything from the property. Unfortunately, I was in for an ugly surprise when I eventually set out on the grand endeavour to do just that.To summarise, the Eureka Seven sequels are bad, bad, bad, and really bad, for the most part. A lot of it comes down to the bitter hack that is Tomoki Kyouda, and his never-ending desire to besmirch his literal masterpiece out of spite for his literal masterpiece. Kyouda has stated that his vision for Eureka Seven was ostensibly mapped out in the first handful of episodes—a story about some punk-rock kid, born lonely at Bell Forest hospital, falling in love with a beautiful girl, and leaving on his coming of age journey towards adulthood. Allegedly, the Bones execs took issue with the dark, bittersweet tone his original layout of the ending took, and thus, had the ending changed to be a happier, and ultimately better conclusion, so as to sell more toys or someshit. Kyouda, being a literal child, has since devoted his entire life to absolutely desecrating the good name of the original, to satisfy his fragile ego, and as a result, has been responsible for some of the worst, and possibly, some of my most hated, anime to exist. To start, Pocket Full of Rainbows was just fucking atrocious, like, what in the fuck was this movie supposed to be? I don’t exaggerate when I say PFOR is my least favourite anime of all time, right next to No Game No fucking Life—it’s that bad. I don’t really want to get into it because it actually makes me quite sad thinking about it. It’s 99.9% garbage and about the only thing it does right is the ending song, which is something that’s always kind of defined Eureka Seven: the music. It’s about the only thing all of the sequels actually get right. Anyway, after PFOR, we had Eureka Seven AO, which wasn’t AS bad as most people make it out to be. It had some gorgeous Nakamura sequences, and enough Itano circuses to make Itano himself blush in embarrassment. Even if Sho Aikawa’s writing was somehow WORSE than Satou Dai’s on a bad day, it doesn’t really affect my enjoyment of the original, nor does it treat the original with overt disrespect.And now, we come to Hi-Evo—yeah, about 600 words in and I’m only now talking about the subject of this review—which is a very, very mixed bag of great ideas, and fucking atrocious ideas. For starters, the first half of Hi-Evo 1 is spectacular! We finally get to see the Summer of Love—one of the most important incidents in the series—which, funnily enough, happens off-screen. Anyway, the second half of Hi-Evo 1 is, yeah, not so good; it’s a half-assed, schizophrenically edited mess of a story, that, despite its admittedly interesting conceit, fails to deliver on almost every front. It even ends with a fucking dumbass bait-and-switch sneak preview of a sequel movie THAT DOESN’T FUCKING EXIST! Wow, you sure fucking trolled me Kyouda—got me a good one. The sequel we ended up getting (don’t worry, I’m almost there, just let me pointlessly ramble for a little while longer) was… good? Hi-Evo 2 is, frankly, kind of, sort of, amazing, kind of, sort of. I know I said the Eureka Seven sequels were “bad, bad, bad, and really bad, for the most part,” but as you can probably guess by the way I’m setting this up, Hi-Evo 2 was the, “for the most part,” part of that summary. I think if you’re an Anemone fan, like me, you’ll end up really enjoying Hi-Evo 2. It’s basically if Anemone was a real girl, and wasn’t trapped in the Pleasure Island of drugs she was designed to sedate herself with. It’s also an audio-visual fucking masterpiece that cuts between widescreen and 4:3 to mimic the stylings of the original show, with appropriate art direction to match. So it’s basically a fanservice film, but with one of the most ridiculous plots ever conceptualised. But like all Eureka Seven sequels, it has problems. There are weird CG segments that surely could have been animated, considering the bat-shit crazy mech sequences in the film, and it’s tonally just, kind of, all over the place. Overall, there’s nothing egregious about the plot; it’s a fanservice film, and, well, I’m a fan, so being serviced felt good, lol. I could go on for longer about this film and talk about the significance of Keiji Fujiwara playing Dewey, but, despite being at 1000 words and not yet mentioning it, this IS an Eureka Seven Hi-Evo 3 review, so now that I’ve finally set the stage, it’s time to discuss it.In anticipation of the film’s release, I followed every crumb, every drop of news to the best of my ability. I was there for all the trailers, all the PVs—the sneak-peak at the first 15 minutes? I was there. So naturally, the music video for the credits theme of the film —a song thoughtfully titled “Eureka” by the band Hentai Shinshi Club—caught my eye when it was uploaded to YouTube. I sat there, watched it, and thought to myself, “Why am I feeling legitimately emotional watching this? I know this is going to suck, and I know Kyouda is going to let me down,” but despite acknowledging that, I couldn’t shake that pleasantly awful feeling of butterflies in my stomach.Right off the bat, my expectations for this film were shaky—like they are with most things—and something just felt… off about the whole thing. I gotta say, I was getting a little bit anxious, and a little bit impatient, and a little bit aggravated. And the more I thought about it—the film and its release—the more I felt a little bit anxious, a little bit impatient, and a little bit aggravated.Alright, first things first: no Yoshida. Yeah, so we’ve lost the heart and soul of Eureka Seven because he was doing Orbital Children at the time or something like that. This is important, really important. Remember what I’m always saying: the character designer is really important, remember? Yoshida is really important, remember? All hope is not lost though, because Okumura Masashi—a man most notable for his work on the beautiful, but blatant Eureka Seven cash-in, Xam’d—decided he would try and fill Yoshida’s shoes. Unfortunately for Okumura, Yoshida wears a size 14. Okumura sure did his fucking best though, because this film looks fucking amazing! Ostensibly the last bastion for hand-animated mecha, aside from, maybe, Hathaway, but then again, I don’t remember Hathaway pulling out Itano circuses every fucking second. Sure, the film doesn’t always look stellar, and in the middle, the quality dips horrendously, but it’s not like the acronym “I.G.” is plastered on the cover or anything, so I can’t exactly hold it to a standard it couldn’t possibly live up to. But, yeah, like Tom Cruise—especially after his little foray in Iran—this movie looks, and sounds, pretty darn cool. And that’s the bottom line, because I said so.Before I really get into things, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the circumstances by which I’m actually able to watch this film. Hi-Evo 3 had its home release in June, and in the meantime, a small community of diehard fans on reddit—who don’t know Japanese, mind you—put together a fansub subtitle track for the film. While it’s not the greatest fansub out there, it was a real labour of love, and is literally the only reason I am able to watch this film. So thank you to those who were a part of that project.Alright, the movie. Okay. As aforementioned, I had already seen the first 15 minutes of the film back when Bandai released it on YouTube, but, oh boy, it was something else seeing it again. I remember doing this during that sneak preview, but as soon as Eureka performed the cut-back drop-turn, my heart fucking skipped a beat, and I said, aloud, in my best Fujiwara impression, “Cut-Back Drop-Turn!” The film doesn’t even make a point of it either, until Holland delivers the appropriate reaction, of course. Speaking of Holland, he’s in this movie, for some reason. Ultimately, he has no business being in this film, other than to share a scene with a pregnant Talho, which drove a fucking knife into my heart as soon as I heard Neye Michiko deliver her first of few lines in this movie. Honestly, it’s probably for the best that Fujiwara didn’t reprise his role here, cause it would have hurt too much, especially considering what Kyouda does with him later. At least with Morikawa voicing him, I can pretend he’s a different character entirely, which isn’t too hard to do, given his awful redesign (reminds me of another character). I’ll just come out and say it (spoilers, kids), Kyouda kills Holland off at the end of this movie, and it isn’t earned, and means absolutely nothing, and because of that, I feel absolutely nothing. I should be outraged, but I’m just… sullen about it—not even sullen, more like emotionless. I didn't even register that it had happened, because, for some reason, I was hopeful that Kyouda wouldn't fuck it up right at the end. I don't know why I ever thought such things.Thankfully, not all was lost. If this film had one saving grace, it would be its titular heroine, Eureka. If there is one thing Tomoki Kyouda is good at, it’s writing characters. Eureka brought a human touch to this film I was honestly shocked to see. Somehow, it makes sense that a grown-up Eureka would become a weight-lifting alcoholic, as out-of-character as that sounds. Hearing Eureka and Anemone, as adults, with the same voice actors, talk as close friends, made everything so, so real to me. I instantly bought into their dynamic. Whilst both their designs aren’t amazing, they still seem believable, as if these characters would actually look the way they do, given the appropriate context. Like, it makes sense Eureka would, without the love or kindness of those around her, mature into a hardened badass, and that Anemone would become a twenty-something that gets frustrated at kids for calling her old. It’s also a perfect touch that she does her hair like Katejina, even if there’s no way that was the parallel Okumura was drawing.Structure-wise, to me, it honestly feels like Kyouda conceptualized the middle part of this film—its emotional core—then realised he had to quickly devise the “plot” of the film, which kinda just bookends either side of the actually good, middle part. However, whilst attempting to ground the inherently larger-than-life soul of Eureka Seven with political intent, geopolitical conflicts, multi-national ethnic terrorism and anti-immigration movements, by means of, general, stern-faced diplomacy, Kyouda inevitably dampens the beating heart that made the franchise so special in the first place. What I’m trying to say is, this film lives and dies on its second act and the relationship between Eureka and Iris, despite Kyouda’s best efforts to “elevate,” or, “subvert,” the original intent of his masterpiece, out of spite for his masterpiece, in some vain attempt to debase what little good he managed in this film.Anyway, this all brings me to the shower scene—arguably the best scene in the entire movie, and possibly, the entire Hi-Evo sub-franchise. Seeing Eureka’s body brought Kyouda’s absolutely ridiculous script crashing down to earth, but in a way so real, I wasn’t ready for it, nor was I expecting it. This was a real woman’s body, with real scars—not fake, neatly adorned, anime scars from some tragic backstory—real scars, accumulated over a lifetime of fighting, externally and internally. Eureka’s scars are painful, and ugly, and harsh, but beautiful, in the sense that despite all that struggling, she continues on living, as hard and unfair as living may be. So that’s why I was shocked to my core when Iris asked to touch her, and then expressed the exact same sentiment I just did. It was mature, emotive writing I thought Kyouda not capable of anymore.But this is Tomoki Kyouda we’re talking about, so it all had to come crashing down somehow, and the cracks started to appear right when Sumner showed up. I don’t know how to say this any other way: Kyouda made Sumner and Ruri fucking jobbers. Why even bring them back? This goes beyond a cameo, because you literally wrote dialogue for Sumner, only to have him killed in the scene you introduced him in. Then we have your big twist, since you’re such a smart, out-of-the-silver-box (see what I did there?) kind of writer. Sigh (there you go, I typed it). Kyouda, why? Why do you retcon your own narrative with stupid shit? You do not deserve a Big O, metafictional plot twist. You have done nothing to EARN a metafictional plot twist. You hack fuck. It makes no sense; it is not smart. Why was Hi-Evo building to this WHEN THERE WAS NO FUCKING PAY OFF!? Having Eureka hug Anemone and tell her she loves her right before the third act WAS the big pay-off of this movie—well, for me, at least—and what’s worse, is that it wasn’t even intentional, just my sentimental ass. Kyouda can’t see what’s in front of him before it’s too late, and it ostensibly ruined the movie. The final conflict was so utterly and artificially manufactured as to be literally laughable. At a point, the movie becomes so caked in continuity, lore and meta, that it rips the stakes clean off the plot. Gosh, I haven't even mentioned Charles and Ray, but for my sake, I'm not going to explain why.Why couldn’t Hi-Evo have been just a fun collection of little “what if?” stories, set in the Eureka Seven universe? If this was the plan all along, then what was the point of Hi-Evo 1? Surely this couldn’t have been the plan all along? This movie ends with NOTHING—not even a fun post-credits scene—it ends with nothing, but Hentai Shinshi Club.I know this review has just become a disjointed, ranting tirade, but at least it helps me feel something. That was the problem with this movie and its ending: I felt nothing. I should have felt something, but I didn’t. When Renton made his grand entrance at the end, it wasn’t real. He didn’t fight his way across worlds to get to Eureka; he didn’t mature and pick up Keiji Fujiwara as a voice actor; he didn’t speak as the loving, caring individual known as “Renton Thurston.” I couldn’t help but think that Renton, in some way, represented the franchise—looking exactly like it did back in 2005—and that I was Eureka, holding on to him for dear life as he fades away into the light.***So, this is it? This is the send-off to the franchise of my favourite work in fiction?You’re right, Kyouda. This, this is all I have. This 24 minutes a night, 90 minutes a sitting. This is my everything. I don’t think that’s a surprise to anyone when they know that I live this. This. This is what I love. But you know what, sometimes things you love don’t always love you back. And you can give, and you can give, and you can give, and you can give, and you can give, and you can give, and sometimes you get nothing in return. You get nothing! And you have friends, and family, and fans coming up and telling you, “Why do you still do it? Why are you still here? Why do you subject yourself to this every night?” It’s because I can’t stop. I can’t! It’s a sickness. I can’t stop! And maybe my life didn’t always turn out the way I thought it would, you know? I thought it would have been better. I thought I earned something. I thought I would be more successful. But you know what. I just can’t stop myself. I can’t. But you, you bring this franchise back one more time. Listen to me, Kyouda! Bring this franchise back one more time, and I’ll put up my entire career.—Dolph Ziggler, probably. that show, and it wasn’t sad crying either, it was happy crying—the best type of crying because it really feels like you’re emotionally decompressing everything. It’s the type of crying where the tears feel like they’re staining your skin; the type of crying where you can feel a lump in your throat, and it hurts. The raw, human sincerity, and pure, emotional honesty of the cast resonated with me, deeply, in a way nothing had managed before, and in a way nothing has managed since. These characters were human, just like me, and they had flaws, just like me, and even if they weren’t actually human—even if they were different—they experienced life all the same. Watching Eureka Seven gave me an emotional catharsis I have hitherto never, in my life, experienced with media, so, I knew it was special. After rewatching it later that year, it became my favourite, and I swear by it to this day. And of course, when something becomes your favourite, you naturally want to check out everything from the property. Unfortunately, I was in for an ugly surprise when I eventually set out on the grand endeavour to do just that.To summarise, the Eureka Seven sequels are bad, bad, bad, and really bad, for the most part. A lot of it comes down to the bitter hack that is Tomoki Kyouda, and his never-ending desire to besmirch his literal masterpiece out of spite for his literal masterpiece. Kyouda has stated that his vision for Eureka Seven was ostensibly mapped out in the first handful of episodes—a story about some punk-rock kid, born lonely at Bell Forest hospital, falling in love with a beautiful girl, and leaving on his coming of age journey towards adulthood. Allegedly, the Bones execs took issue with the dark, bittersweet tone his original layout of the ending took, and thus, had the ending changed to be a happier, and ultimately better conclusion, so as to sell more toys or someshit. Kyouda, being a literal child, has since devoted his entire life to absolutely desecrating the good name of the original, to satisfy his fragile ego, and as a result, has been responsible for some of the worst, and possibly, some of my most hated, anime to exist. To start, Pocket Full of Rainbows was just fucking atrocious, like, what in the fuck was this movie supposed to be? I don’t exaggerate when I say PFOR is my least favourite anime of all time, right next to No Game No fucking Life—it’s that bad. I don’t really want to get into it because it actually makes me quite sad thinking about it. It’s 99.9% garbage and about the only thing it does right is the ending song, which is something that’s always kind of defined Eureka Seven: the music. It’s about the only thing all of the sequels actually get right. Anyway, after PFOR, we had Eureka Seven AO, which wasn’t AS bad as most people make it out to be. It had some gorgeous Nakamura sequences, and enough Itano circuses to make Itano himself blush in embarrassment. Even if Sho Aikawa’s writing was somehow WORSE than Satou Dai’s on a bad day, it doesn’t really affect my enjoyment of the original, nor does it treat the original with overt disrespect.And now, we come to Hi-Evo—yeah, about 600 words in and I’m only now talking about the subject of this review—which is a very, very mixed bag of great ideas, and fucking atrocious ideas. For starters, the first half of Hi-Evo 1 is spectacular! We finally get to see the Summer of Love—one of the most important incidents in the series—which, funnily enough, happens off-screen. Anyway, the second half of Hi-Evo 1 is, yeah, not so good; it’s a half-assed, schizophrenically edited mess of a story, that, despite its admittedly interesting conceit, fails to deliver on almost every front. It even ends with a fucking dumbass bait-and-switch sneak preview of a sequel movie THAT DOESN’T FUCKING EXIST! Wow, you sure fucking trolled me Kyouda—got me a good one. The sequel we ended up getting (don’t worry, I’m almost there, just let me pointlessly ramble for a little while longer) was… good? Hi-Evo 2 is, frankly, kind of, sort of, amazing, kind of, sort of. I know I said the Eureka Seven sequels were “bad, bad, bad, and really bad, for the most part,” but as you can probably guess by the way I’m setting this up, Hi-Evo 2 was the, “for the most part,” part of that summary.

Just put the franchise to rest now.This movie doesn't tell us anything besides throwing us in. There are Nirvashes that aren't piloted by anyone fighting Scub Corals. For some reason, Anemone is chief of an organization called A.C.I.D which is part of Blue Earth. Also, there's Green earth which they're fighting against as well. Eureka is an agent of A.C.I.D. Furthermore, Dewey Novak for whatever reason has superpowers. After saving Iris, Eureka is tasked with taking her to Hawaii their base of operations.This story is oddly a Slice of Life with Dewey...Novak trying to kill Eureka and Iris. Seeing Eureka and Iris trying to bond doesn't work because of Iris's unbearable personality that consists of only crying and screaming. More unbearable is that somehow this is still tied up with the original series and the movies even the spin-off movie Pocket Full of Rainbows. The plastering of advertising in this movie throws one off as well, from Bandai Namco, Studio Bones, Coke, CNN, BBC, and Skateboards.If I had to guess, Eureka 7 was the first timeline. All the movies, even spin-off movies, are other timelines created by Eureka herself with the intent of getting her own happy ending. Dewey Novak was trying to fight his fate. Being that these stories/timelines are written by Eureka. It's Character vs God essentially. What makes no sense, is how Iris will eventually become Eureka herself.

Kuiba: Shiwanhuoji,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16756/Kuiba__Shiwanhuoji,"['""Kuiba"" is the first of a *five-part* feature length film series that is about a powerful creature, Kuiba, who is reborn every set number of years to bring about destruction. On one side, we have people and their deities that try to kill him over and over again throughout the years before his incumbent revival, while on Kuiba\'s side, we have another group of people who worship him like a god, and because Kuiba once saved them, as you will see in the intro of the film. You could almost say, people who are outcasts from normal society are now part of the Kuiba-following clan....In one particular rebirth year, Kuiba narrowly escapes his assassination. As he has not grown to his true self, he appears as a baby boy, who we learn is named Manji. Although it is not mentioned, it appears Manji is raised by a couple that found him. Sadly, due to reasons we don\'t know, that couple have separated and Manji is primarily raised (now a young child) by his adoptive \'father\'. His father\'s desire is to be a great warrior and passing everything he learns to his son in due time. When news breaks that \'Kuiba\' is alive, Manji (not knowing he is Kuiba) and his father try to recruit into the army in order to battle Kuiba. Hereafter, we learn a number of things about Kuiba\'s past, his power, and the people around him. Although there are Sci-Fi elements, this is a Fantasy anime.The story is actually very much an original and plays to the strength of Chinese history/mythology (Journey to the West). And yes, as you may have guessed it, Kuiba is a Chinese animation. Not Korean as another reviewer pointed out. *Keep note of this piece of information before proceeding to watching the film, especially the ending. The ending sadly is not satisfying because of the heavy build-up in the middle. But considering the fact that the director has purposely chosen to break the film into five-parts, it had to work one way or another and using a cliffhanger would have been displeasing. I actually appreciate what they have done. I would have wanted a bit more, but since I saw the second film days after the first, I am not depreciating the value (rating) of the film due to the ending.The art is heavily inspired from Japanese animation. In an interview, the producers have mentioned that they, Vasoon Animation, are trying to bring quality animations with inspiration from Japanese (particular for Kuiba) and American artistic styles. That said, however, there are inconsistencies in the animation and art throughout this film. Furthermore, the art has a distinctive Chinese feel, which is a good thing. For example, the main character, Manji, is clearly based on the monkey god and heavily inspired by the Journey to the West stories. You could make the argument that Manji looks very similar to Naruto from the Naruto anime, especially because both have whiskers, but considering how much of the story is based on the Journey to the West and/or other Chinese stories, I believe that debate falls short. Other characters also have distinctive feature that differs it from the typical Japanese animated art style. Once again, contrary to the other reviewer, I did not see any similarities between this and Dragonball. The art is very much similar to mainstream (21st century) Japanese anime. Nothing close to the 80s or Tezuka Osamu drawings.There is nothing spectacular about the sound or music, but as this is only the first of five films, we have yet to hear the more emotion-evoking themes. The current music and sound works very well. The voice cast does too. I did not find any particular Chinese voice memorable, but overall the voices of the characters were chosen intelligently. Furthermore, I decided to watch the first film with the Japanese dubs as well. Here, we come to hear a lot of familiar voices. I believe, Manji, is voiced by Takeuchi Junko, known for her role as Naruto from the Naruto anime. However, I could be wrong with this assumption. I wouldn\'t be surprised if this was true because of how similar Manji and Naruto (original, young lad, pre-Shippuden series) are. The Japanese Manji is quite memorable. Once again, I did not find anything wrong with the choice of the Japanese voice casts either. There was no particular character who had an annoying voice which seems to be apparent in Japanese anime in recent years. The producers opted for a more serious anime with some comedic moments (usually portrayed in the art of the face and mouth).The characters and character developments are fair; nothing unique, exciting or spectacular yet. Manji has not realise what he is. He does not even question why he goes into an uncontrollable, unconscious state. His father doesn\'t know about this (in the first film) either. I personally believe, Manji will not know until the fourth or fifth film where he has to make a choice that will question his own life and the people around him. I am not sure if it was the translations fault or if it was the directors decision, but we don\'t know the background of many characters we meet and become acquainted to. Characters that appear many times as flashbacks. Specifically, Manji\'s adoptive mother and the relationship between her and Manji\'s adoptive father. Manji\'s father calls her princess for some reason and that is not explained. This could be the fault of a poor translation, but we later see that she is a very important character in the film. Most likely coming from a noble and wealthy family. The character development of Manji\'s adoptive father is weak too. There is no clear reason how he came to be what he is and the life he is living nor why he left Manji\'s adoptive mother. It\'s almost a cliché story here where the father, perhaps from a poor family, had a relationship with a woman from a noble family, but due to family issues decided to separate while Manji went along with him. This relationship is so weakly executed that during a particular scene when Manji openly calls her \'mother\', the surrounding people who know her as a noble doesn\'t question why he called her mother nor their relationship.Nevertheless, overall, I enjoyed this anime very much. Due to loopholes in the story and some of the character developments, I gave it a par rating of 7 out of 10 (see my profile to understand the rubric of my ratings). If this had been a singular film of 2-hours with a justified ending, I would have easily given it an 8 or 9 out of 10. If you are not used to Chinese voice acting, I would highly suggest the Japanese. It is well worth it. I will not be reviewing the later films, but can tell you that the second film starts straight from the first. More characters are introduced and we get to know people from Kuiba\'s side of the spectrum (the Kuiba-following clan). If you want to find out what I gave the second film, check out my completed list. I tend to give very fair ratings to anime. I base my ratings predominantly on art style and animation (quality), emotion-evoking music, and enjoyment. Not so much character development or voice casts. However, if there is an annoying voice actor, I tend to avoid the anime altogether. If I review the anime, then I look at character development since most people find that important. Hence, why I did so here.As a recommendation, I would suggest to wait for the English translation to the second film, fan-subs or official Blu-ray (comes with English subs and Japanese dubs), and then watch the first and second together. Watching the first without the second will quench your thirst for more. In one particular rebirth year, Kuiba narrowly escapes his assassination.

Morita-san wa Mukuchi.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10671/Morita-san_wa_Mukuchi,"['I admit, I didn\'t expect a short anime series when I added this to my list of ""Plan to Watch."" However, I was not disappointed. With this review we\'re dealing with an anime short and I\'ll give my reasons WHY people should or should not watch these shorts.Morita-san wa Mukuchi is based on the 4koma, actually, IS the literal adaptation from the 4koma. With this in mind the purpose of these shorts are basically the same as the 4koma in newspapers: drop a quick funny or give a humorously warm ending. This is the point people are missing and it\'s understandable since we\'re used to...watching anime like K-On!, Lucky Star, A-Channel, etc. in this genre. We\'re not used to this short short approach to anime, but once we do, we should keep this in mind in our reviews as it is what we ARE reviewing. Comparing this anime to said above slice-of-life giants is like comparing Robot Chicken to Family Guy or an orange to an apple. Morita-san wa Mukuchi and Lucky Star may be in the same genre, but are completely different in their goal in pleasing the audience. Where Lucky Star develops a ""plot"" around satirizing Japanese otaku culture, Morita-san wa Mukuchi focuses on quick humor, much like you see in newspaper comics in your local bagel shop. In this sense, Morita-san wa Mukuchi\'s plot IS the quick humor it induces on its audience. Anyway enough of my babbling and onward toward the review.Story & Enjoyment (9): Again, Morita-san wa Mukuchi\'s plot IS the quick humor it induces on its audience. There are small events and occurrences that happen in the shorts that lead to a quick laugh. When I watch anime on the go, I\'ve always had the problem of getting interrupted by errands and tasks at hand, which of course ruin the episode altogether. I liked the short length because I can get a laugh and brighten my day in a pinch before I have to attend to work. I watched this throughout the week when I during hallway time or free time before my classes, sports, and clubs. Afterward, I\'ve always been in a better mood.Art & Character (8): Simple, yet clever. Backdrops and setting is all simple, getting straight to the point of location and type of situation. Character art falls under the same praise as well. Morita\'s blank eyes that clearly express her level of deep thought. Miki\'s short hair and pink hair clips the radiate her energetic and cheerful persona. Hana\'s curly hair and wide eyes that give her this shy and self-conscience look. Basically character designs reflect their actual personalities. Along with the art, the characters were cleverly made. Deceptively simple, each character individually commanded no attention or any serious merit. However, when these simple characters are all put together, they created some extremely humorous scenes I enjoyed a lot.Sound (7): No complaints. Upbeat intro to bring you prep you for the humor about to be induced. Simple background sound and music that compliment the situation and humor. The characters\' had voices that fit, which is key to making any type of slice-of-life anime funny.Overall (8): Again, since this is a series or short shorts that are meant to induce a bit of humor. Morita-san wa Mukuchi are for those busy anime fans who enjoy slice-of-life comedy, and want to feed their anime addiction throughout a busy work day. This is my primary reason why I enjoyed it: I could enjoy and laugh at anime at school without ruining anime with real life interruptions! watching anime like K-On!, Lucky Star, A-Channel, etc. in this genre.

', ""For one reason or another, many people seem to dislike or just overlook short animes.  It's true that lots of them are bad, but it's also true there are some worth watching.  This is...a hard choice.  You may want to keep reading to find out.There is one particular genre that some people really love and some really hate: High School slice-of-life comedies.

A very simple High School slice-of-life comedy; It goes straight to the funny part and the episodes end with a punch-line.  Simple as that.The art is pretty good for a short, though nothing special if you compare it to any current non-shounen twenty minute-long anime.As far a sound goes, I find the OP really annoying, but the seiyuus are good enough.  Again, pretty simple anime, not much work in the voice department needed.  Funny thing that the main character is virtually mute.I only need one word to describe the characters.  Generic.  Good thing nobody was expecting anything different. Oh yeah! Did I mention the main character is virtually mute? Now the cast is has someone who is not THAT generic!All things said, I enjoy this anime. It's funny enough and it's only three minutes long.  Go watch it, you'll probably enjoy it. wa Mukuchi.

A lot of people may have different opinions towards this, but I'll tell you mine. It's perfect.They had an anime to show, but it'd be hard competing with all the other ones that have been released, especially when there is no story, no character development, or anything complex. So what do they do?, make the eps only 3 minutes long.Due to this, someone like me who has...their dish of anime always being full, always has time to spare 3 minutes to watch something fun and light hearted. I find that my enjoyment of these 3 minute episodes of Morita-san wa Mukuchi can sometimes even be greater than those with the traditional 24 minute episodes.I've watched things like, Lucky Star, K-ON!, or A-Channel and I tell you, Morita-san wa Mukuchi, though doesn't live up to be as good as those, it's pretty damn good for what it achieves in the time it has.Anyways, this is just something nice to pick up when you're bored or want to kill time. It's not something that's supposed to be dug up and thought about in a difficult manner. It's just something that's just..... there. You know... it's just... there.Story: 5There is no story.Art: 5It's kinda old, but I didn't expect much anyway.Sound: 5It was nice.Character: 6There was no character development, but I didn't see anything cliche (e.g. girl with watermelons has boobs lol). What's interesting is Mayu is the most interesting character for someone who hardly talks.Enjoyment: 8I liked it. I can always spare 3 minutes watching eps as they came out. Skipping the OP will cut it down to 2 minutes and a half, so it's even shorter.Overall: 7There is nothing actually wrong with this anime. Sure there is no story but I've seen plenty of anime with no story. Though they make up for it by character development, but this doesn't even have that. It's really is just purely based on the enjoyment it gives. But, it surprises me how well they can use 2 and a half minutes.Bored? Don't feel like watching something serious? Give this a try! :P their dish of anime always being full, always has time to spare 3 minutes to watch something fun and light hearted.

Skipping the OP will cut it down to 2 minutes and a half, so it's even shorter.Overall: 7There is nothing actually wrong with this anime. Sure there is no story but I've seen plenty of anime with no story. Though they make up for it by character development, but this doesn't even have that. It's really is just purely based on the enjoyment it gives. But, it surprises me how well they can use 2 and a half minutes.Bored? Don't feel like watching something serious? Give this a try! :P"", 'Its a 3 mins per episode anime and there are 13 episodes so in all your spending 39 mins on this whole anime, plus somehow the creator(s) are able to put in a opening song within the three mins which last 30 secs so you can say each episode is 2 mins and 30 secs, so why not watch it. The main character doesnt say anything throught out  the anime, well except in her mind, while her friends and her mother, the side characters,wont shut up. This anime is definitely a slice of life anime with a slight shoujo ai context to it but...nothing more. well enough with this review just watch the anime. nothing more. well enough with this review just watch the anime.', 'i had no idea this was a ""short"" anime series until after the first episode, in fact i thought the video player had just screwed up and cut me off :P however the anime short thing was new to me but i honestly enjoyed it. when watching this keep in mind that there\'s not really supposed to be a story, just short videos leading up to some cute joke or something along those lines ""like reading a comic strip in the news"" ""actually these reminded me lots of the garfield shorts skits in-between the segments of garfield and friends."" ... you can finish this whole...series in little over half an hour... this never really made me crack up laughing, but i was smiling the whole time while watching this ^.^- so, this is only like half an hour, and as valuable as your time is this show takes it with a cheap price, which makes it worth the bargain. :P series in little over half an hour... this never really made me crack up laughing, but i was smiling the whole time while watching this ^.^- so, this is only like half an hour, and as valuable as your time is this show takes it with a cheap price, which makes it worth the bargain. :P']"

Despite that, I really did enjoy the feels trip this takes you on.The animation is pretty standard, but very pretty. The music serves to make you feel pretty sad at the right times, and the sound creates a very immersive atmosphere.The story itself feels incomplete as the story really has no time to build to any sort of resolution, although it does try.I feel like all the pieces are here to have a very good 1 season long anime, or maybe just a full feature length movie, but...as an OVA, it's mediocre.

The art style, fluidity of the animation, and background music succeeded in creating a wonderful atmosphere, one that is relaxing, yet full of emotion.A tale that doesn't need any words to be understood, told in a silent narrative driven by the calming, clear music of Debussy; the characters are shaped with the help of facial expressions, body language, and actions, and it works!

Onigamiden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8487/Onigamiden,"['Going back in time is always a surprising turn of events.  As if that wasn\'t enough, you also find out that you\'re the special hero that has to stop a conflict between two opposing factions!That\'s pretty much what the main character goes through, and what the premise for Onigamiden is.  Unfortunately, that\'s as interesting as the story gets.  Jun Tendou, a middle school boy, is thrown back in time to the ancient Japan in the Heian period and finds out that he is the Savior- the only one who can control the legendary Orochi and turn the tides in a war between...the Oni tribe and the humans.With this set-up, a somewhat interesting yet predictable turn of events occurs, and the theme of ""man versus nature"" comes about.  The question of who the hero should fight for is raised. It\'s a common theme to explore, sure, but that isn\'t the concern here.  Rather, it\'s because of its execution that makes the issue largely one-sided.  Due to the how the story presents itself, the main dilemma that Jun goes through is hardly given any thought and the decision that he\'s supposed to make becomes obvious (in other words, there are really no ""gray areas"" presented).  Thus, it makes the majority of the plot all too standard.Art and animation are obviously the focus of this movie. The scenery and traditional temples all look nice, and help depict the setting of an older Japan.  Character designs might feel a bit different for some, but nothing too jarring.  I personally got a Sky Crawlers feel from them, which isn\'t much of a surprise, as it\'s the work of the same character designer.  Where the art and animation really shines, though, are the designs for the fantasy elements.  The Oni tribe looks particularly demonic, and the CG effect that they have actually helps to create an evil aura for them.  The spiritual beings, including the Orochi, all have fascinating designs which really bring out the setting of the movie.  The action scenes are nicely animated and are another plus.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the sound, which suffers from inconsistency problems.  Sometimes the soundtrack is good- it is fitting and gives the appropriate atmosphere to the movie\'s traditional setting.   At other times, however, modern pop/rock is playing and basically feels anachronistic.  This is mostly noticeable through the action scenes.  At the very least, the voice roles are appropriate and not out of place.  The one thing that\'s noteworthy about the sound is the ED, ""Starlight.""   It\'s a rather catchy song that creates a rather emotional feeling.Characters, for the most part, feel very static.  None of their personalities particularly stand out.  They exist and fulfill their respective roles.  There might be some interesting developments shown for some of the characters, such as their past or motivations, but no one really changes by the movie\'s end, save for maybe Jun.  He is pretty much the typical male lead who first lives an average life, until something extraordinary happens.   Of course, he\'s confused about all this at first and questions the morality of the situation, eventually making the (obvious) decision to do what the hero is supposed to do.Despite all its problems, Onigamiden was a somewhat entertaining watch.  The action scenes were nice, as were the depictions of the various mythological beings in this movie.  The premise, setting, and themes had a fair amount of potential, brought down by its lackluster story and characters.  The pacing was fine, as no particular scene dragged on for too long.

That\'s right, this is the same studio that brought us The Sonic OVA, Hikaru no Go & The Choujo. We\'ll continue film festival week with a look at this.Story:Our protagonist is an ordinary middle school boy. One day, he\'s chased by a shadowy oni and finds himself in a mysterious temple. This results in him being taken to the Heian period to help aid in the fight against the oni. But there\'s more to the situation than meets the eye and he\'s going to have to tread lightly.Let\'s start with the big issue with the film. Mainly, there are...a lot of elements that don\'t add up. For example, it tries to make the oni sympathetic in the second half but the oni also very deliberately make themselves look like shadowy monsters and tried to murder our protagonist in cold blood when they could have tried, I don\'t know, talking to him. We also have a scene where our protagonist is about to be sent home, scarpers for no reason and then goes back to a ceremony that will send him home after a pointless interlude. Because that\'s good story telling. Having a hero who Runs away from something for no adequately explored reason only to return to it after a short scene. There\'s also the question of why we need a protagonist who\'s from the future and a middle school student. In the narrative this is basically glossed over as ""he\'s the last part of this clan who has this special power"" but that comes across as really contrived.I actually want to talk in detail about this while time travelling element. Because, honestly, it causes a lot of problems. Even without the contrived reasoning behind it, it just plays into the whole ""chosen hero with a special power"" cliché. And our protagonist doesn\'t help matters. He comes across as completely unprepared and as not even willing to try. Even Miaka from Fushigi Yuugi could kick this kid\'s ass and take his lunch money. At least she had some degree of determination.Characters:The biggest problem here is with the protagonist himself, young Tendou Jun. He spends most of the film being a whiny sod because he just wants to go home and he can\'t figure out which side to believe. Even though the ordinary humans he talks to never dispute a single thing the oni have told him. No, seriously, it\'s not a case of side A & side B contradicting each other, it\'s more that Side A says X while side B says ""yeah, so?""The antagonist being a complete moron doesn\'t help the situation. This dude quite literally sets himself up for failure when he could have easily won simply by not messing with time travel.The rest of the cast are just boring one note characters. Some of whom we spend all of two minutes with and are supposed to care about for some reason.Art:The artwork is pretty good. There are some nice mythical creature designs and some pretty solid action sequences. The animation is nicely polished. The only real issue is that some of the more large scale action sequences can be overly chaotic.Sound:The acting is on the sub-par side. Most of the actors deliver their lines as though they\'re very bored and the performances sound more than a bit stilted. Ono Kensho & Ishihara Satomi in particular. The music does not fit the whole ""fantastical past with magic"" aesthetic. It\'s a lot of generic metal. Which isn\'t always balanced all that well. There are some scenes where it\'s far too loud and you can\'t hear the dialogue very well.Hoyay:The closest you get to ho-yay is Raikou\'s attached companions. And even then they don\'t spend enough time interacting with him to really say anything definitive.Areas of Improvement:Lose the Time Travel Aspect. You could easily have the hero be from the remote countryside and not waste time with scenes of the modern age or with the majority of the exposition scenes designed to explain the situation to him.Give us a hero with a brain. It\'s fine to have a protagonist who questions a situation. In fact, that\'s great. The problem here is that he runs in circles and can\'t piece anything together without having some other character outright explain it to him.Give the sides more areas of contention. This is another aspect that\'s great, in theory. The idea of the sides in a conflict both having their own takes and the protagonist having to decide who to believe is a good one. But it\'s so inept here. ""So, you think the oni are bad?"" ""I dunno. I\'m fighting them because..."" That\'s all we see for about twenty minutes.Final Thoughts:This is easily the worst film I\'ve looked at so far this week. The narrative is a mess. The characters are shoddy. The acting is, at best, sub-par and the music isn\'t suitable for the aesthetic. A lot of the ideas have potential but the execution just isn\'t there.

But it also offers a greater insight into modern day society as the protagonist himself is from the present and it shows the mistakes made in the past. What I really like is that at the beginning we really perceive the ""Oni"" as evil although they are not. Throughout the movie itself there is a lot of criticism, not just of mankind in general,but of the greedy nobles and even priests,which is very realistic and, for me, intriguing.

Remember that pretty cool action scene that you just imagined. Does this shitty middle schooler who gets isekaid back in time to save everyone because he’s the chosen one or whatever seem anywhere near as good as the movie that intro promised?It’s all fine though since he eventually is brought into that...cool setting, which might seem like enough of a reason for you to care about some genuinely great action sequences but don’t worry, the film makes sure to keep explaining things that you don’t care about. In fact, the film makes sure you know everything about everyone. The only thing it doesn’t tell you about these characters is why you should give a shit about them.This egregious amount of exposition I think is the point of the film. It wants to throw you into a series of conflicts and resolve these issues with words, which I don’t think is necessarily a bad thing. If I did then monogatari would be nowhere near my favorite anime of all time. The difference between this film and monogatari though, is that monogatari was built with conversation in mind, whereas Millennium Dragon feels like a fantasy action movie with some boring “Violence is bad” arc thrown in to make it feel unique. It instead leads to long, boring exposition, which is the opposite of fun.When the film does eventually reach these fun moments, it is genuinely well done, I simply did not give a single shit about what was going on. I don’t know how they made me not care about this kid with a dragon beating the shit out of everyone, but they somehow managed it. Maybe it’s because once the kid gets the dragon nobody else can-do shit to him so he’s basically invincible which ruins any tension.If you were to just isolate the brief segments of something, then the animation and OST alone would be enough to carry the film. Unfortunately, there’s a whole other film attached to these scene’s that make sure to ruin an enjoyment that could have been had. I genuinely feel bad for the talented staff behind these moments.All in all, if you want a story about a reluctant hero that’s forced to learn about the two sides to a conflict they’re an outsider to and know nothing about, with themes of man vs nature sprinkled throughout…Just watch Princess Mononoke you uncultured swine.4/10This Review is actually the script to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TojozWIlHwCheck that out and subscribe to the channel if you want to see more reviews like it. cool setting, which might seem like enough of a reason for you to care about some genuinely great action sequences but don’t worry, the film makes sure to keep explaining things that you don’t care about.

So let's see if this short is actually worth checking out.Story: The story is nice and simple. It's mostly just Pikachu playing hide and seek with other Pokemon. Nothing remarkable, but it didn't have to be considering it's just supposed to get you ready for the movie, which it does. However, I did like that they changed it up at about the half-way point.Art: Given the concept of trying to make the Pokemon blend in with their...surroundings, the artwork should help work this in, which it does beautifully. What's even better is that the small amount of CG that they do use for the short is either used to help point out where certain Pokemon are due to how well they blend in or for a more cartoony look. However, the artwork isn't as good as other Pokemon shorts, like Pikachu's Rescue Adventure.Sound: The soundtrack is pretty good, sporting a few tracks that I actually wouldn't mind listening to outside of the short. However, they're not as creative as other shorts.Character: The only character I can really talk about is the narrator. My problem with him is the same as my problem with the narrator in Slowking's Day, that being he only tells us stuff we already know. So the short could have worked without him. As for everyone else, I did like seeing how seriously Larvitar takes his job while also being laid back at times.Enjoyment: Considering the movie that this short comes with, this is the only reason to bother purchasing the movie (if you can find one that still comes with the short that is). However, being that this is the internet, you can just watch the short without showing any support for the movie, which I highly recommend. It's funny, cute, and entertaining, so give it a shot. surroundings, the artwork should help work this in, which it does beautifully.

However, the artwork isn't as good as other Pokemon shorts, like Pikachu's Rescue Adventure.Sound: The soundtrack is pretty good, sporting a few tracks that I actually wouldn't mind listening to outside of the short. However, they're not as creative as other shorts.Character: The only character I can really talk about is the narrator. My problem with him is the same as my problem with the narrator in Slowking's Day, that being he only tells us stuff we already know. So the short could have worked without him. As for everyone else, I did like seeing how seriously Larvitar takes his job while also being laid back at times.Enjoyment: Considering the movie that this short comes with, this is the only reason to bother purchasing the movie (if you can find one that still comes with the short that is). However, being that this is the internet, you can just watch the short without showing any support for the movie, which I highly recommend. It's funny, cute, and entertaining, so give it a shot.""]"
Koi to Uso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34934/Koi_to_Uso,"['Love and Lies is a 12 episode anime where love takes the form of lies and each of the characters are like walking chalkboards, constantly scratching upon each other. Japan for some reason deemed it fit to pass on the torch of its current social crisis to the biggest intellectual heavyweight of a medium out there. By presenting a theoretical scenario in which society as a whole is shaped a certain way in order to entertain the idea of Japan\'s birth rates not being in the gutter, we are hence introduced to another run-of-the-mill-overdramatized-romance-love-triangle-rectangle-harem-cocktease. And impressively enough, its\' atrocious and unexplained setup remarkably gives something...like Eromanga a whole new level of credibility. While its\' innovativity didn\'t didn\'t speak for much in the minds of the masses, at least it had the audacity to try and push forward a healthy agenda. ""It might be grasping at straws, but she\'s still fertile"". Meanwhile on the other end of the spectrum, we have an anime that is centered around this very same nuanced topic, yet fails to provide any substantial worth at all to the table in regards to social commentary, or much of anything, really. About midway through it crumbles down under the weight of its nonexistent ruleset and unexplored concept, but impale me with a cactus if these redundant melodramatic pieces need consistency within anything but MUH FEELS.While some thought that resides strictly within the compounds of the show does delve into questioning the validity of a clearly-corrupt system via the characters, I find it extremely difficult to believe the writer herself put any while actually writing this story. In anything but an ideal world, the idea of these arranged marriages would be doomed from the get-go. And in an ideal world, there\'d be no need for them in the first place. So in the end, all we\'re left with is a hypothetical scenario that is not and can not be founded in reality by any stretch of the imagination, ever. Thus the series is forced to revolve around this lofty joke of a scenario, and revolve around it, it does. Not only would it be a shitty situation on an emotional and mental basis for most young people, but for some reason it is able to reach the back ends of society as well. If you decide against being being a mindless drone (which is somehow a rare occurance, seeing as teenagers love losing their freedom of choice, being enslaved, etc), it is for some reason able to influence your academic standing for the worse, with no apparent reason anywhere in sight.Imagine being on the short end of an abusive relationship. The person you\'re paired with treats you like dirt, and you might be in love with someone else. So what happens when you try turning your life around for the obvious better? You get shunned by society, your future put at risk and ironically enough get deemed a lesser human being than your peers. How or why rejecting an arranged marriage is the end all be all of a person\'s highschool life is beyond me. May as well write ""SEX OFFENDER"" on the entrance exam sheet in big, bald letters just so everyone is aware what a menace to society these rebellious teens really are. Case and point - Marriages are apparently all sunhshine and rainbows where nothing bad can ever occur, and likewise all people are inherently bound to accept the iron fist of free will.Despite there being enough conveniences and unexplored scenarios relating to the story to where\'d I\'d call plotholes, the worst detractor evidently might just be how poorly the author invisioned this artifical caricurature of a modern society of hers to function. If anything, this red string of science would eventually end up bringing the country\'s mortality rate to new peaks entirely, as suicide is already enough of an epidemic currently as is. Therefore, not only does it serve as a weak ass plot, but it also contradicts the very nature of the idea that is combating low birth rate for which it initially set out to do. The only counter-argument ever provided against any of this is that it works cuz.. science, \'n stuff. Because we all damn well know scientists ought to seize and take notice of all of our behavoural patterns, personality traits and preferrable positions in bed. If we\'ve come this far, Koi to Uso\'s neo-Japan should be an island paradise, barely short of eden. Technology, banzai.Neji is either the biggest excuse for a human being I\'ve had the displeasure of setting my eyes upon or the typical Japanese beta male, I really don\'t know anymore. This man trembles in fear and is required to turn the other cheek as the thought of looking another person into the eyes instills such immense dread into the very fiber of his being, especially when one such person happens to be a moderately cute girl who he ends up accidentally wooing by giving a slight demonstration of his immeasurable bravery. Neji knows no fear, ladies and gentlemen, as he only takes 3 full hours to hand over a chopped up piece of his eraser to this desperate damsel in distress. Upon recieving the rougher edge of said eraser, cute girl is suddenly transformed into the love of his life the moment she thanks him for being such an indecisive, although considerate, loser. This is what the main characters\' infatuation for one another stems from, sadly enough. I can only assume that it is because of this, I, in recent memory oftentimes encounter myself subconsciously wandering off into the deepest and darkest recesses of my mind, only to spend endless hours upon hours wondering if our species was doomed from the very beginning. Cue the oversatured Nietzsche quote, please.""𝘏𝘦 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘧𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵𝘴 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘮𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘴 𝘮𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 𝘵𝘢𝘬𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘩𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘣𝘺 𝘣𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘢 𝘮𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳. 𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘪𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘨𝘢𝘻𝘦 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘰 𝘢𝘯 𝘢𝘣𝘺𝘴𝘴, 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘣𝘺𝘴𝘴 𝘨𝘢𝘻𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘭𝘴𝘰 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶."".. That\'s the one. Despite what the aformentioned may make you believe, make no mistake. Neji is quite the player. No, he is THE player. The aftermath of being such an immense pussy his entire life inevitably resulted in his very body transforming itself into a pussy magnet. But his savagery doesn\'t stop there. The pure sight of Neji\'s huge pussy makes him irresistable to guys as well, although that\'s another story entirely. I\'m sure that by now most of HanaKana\'s characters would be able to compete in some sort of national women\'s marathon for constantly running away from their male counterparts in these drama series so much. What seperates her from Orange\'s Naho is the old saying about the shy ones being the kinkiest out the bunch, which surely ought to hold some truth this time around. Forest sex, anyone?With this in mind, Erasergal is probably to be considered the story\'s main heroine. It\'s been an entire year since I rose above and beyond the wish-washy poetry of my collegues by writing an intellectual diatribe for last summer season\'s Orange, yet it remains as fresh as ever in my mind. As such, there are some paralells to be drawn between the two heroines from the overall feel of the shows to even matching haircuts. Evidently so, what makes Erasergal stand out as the superior/updated version of Naho is the fact that she actually gets shit done on her own accord. No Kakeru-kun is needed here, when she wants some good ol\' forest sex, good ol\' forest sex will be had. With every tool at her desposal and virtually very little competition, she takes Nejima by the balls and French-kisses him until they run dry. Quite commendably so, really. Apart from her subpar taste in men, HanaKana does this girl justice. She has no problem cucking her friend out of the relationship with her fiance and rocks some cute bangs while doing it. #HanaKanaPleaseGetSomeDiversityYourEntireCastingCatalogueIsBangsRegardless of the heaps of praise I could give to her character in comparison, she is overall extremely willy-nilly in what she wants. It\'s like she\'s got severe bipolar disorder and gets caught up in the moment so heavily one episode, only for next week to flush it down the unkempt toilet like it\'s all bygones and make-believe, cus it\'d make harem member #2 sad. Regardless of harem member #2 consciously going out of her way to get them to shag in front of her very eyes. Whatever, logic isn\'t this show\'s forte and it slowly devolves into an endurance test of how many mental flops Erasergal can do per 20 minutes, before breaking out into wishful tears full of regret and getting comforted by Nejima who is at this point having a mental breakdown over the overwhelming guilt and being an overall pansy who shouldn\'t be loved by anyone other than his own mother.Ririna is the second most prominent member of the Nejima Fan Brigade. Despite of her shortcomings and lack of comprehension for her own feelings, she is cute. However, the shortcoming that serves to seperate her from the other members is the overwhelming fact that she is, in fact, a cuck. And I do not use this term lightly or as a form of internet slang in hopes of coming off as hip. Ririna is full-fledged Resident Cuckold in the flesh. The real thing. This girl literally goes out of her way to force her future husband into a make-out sesh with some girl she\'s known for a day\'s time. Her backstory is that of loneliness and sorrow, as she\'s never had any real friends to speak of. Yet when she does acquire the faintest signs of friendships, she successfully serves as a gap closer which would in turn make her the ultimate third wheel, essentially sending her back to square one. Because she admires their unadulterated romance. The irony is that the romance in this show is BAD. Anywhom, Nisaka does well to point this out before going on some completely idiotic tantrum about how the after-effects of cucking can harm Nejima\'s academic performance. But good on him for trying.  #TeamCuckLast and dead least in the race for Neji\'s heart, there is the sole male companion of the gang. Nisaka is sharp, easily embarrassed and full of angst. Why is he full of angst? Either because he\'s gay, or he\'s gay and his taste in men is subpar. While to some extent I want to applaud the writer for going this extra mile, is this really anything beyond a fan ship from a fujoshi\'s hidden locker? Surely, no one in their right mind thought this ship was ever setting sail. Perhaps after years of discrimination in Japan, being gay is the new blockbuster recipe after Yuri on Ice. His voice is good to the ears, but as a non-13 year old girl I sure was not hoping for any.. unforseen unpleasantries to occur between the two boys. #NejiDroppedTheSoapFinally; Shuu Igarashi, being the only female cast member able to contain her overarching lust over Nejima\'s shallow manhood personally comes as a huge disappointment. While equipped with a design that reeks of Eromanga\'s Sagiri that suddenly started hanging out with the wrong crowd and recently got out of rehab with a whole new jaded outlook on life, she is also appointed as being the granddaughter of Lady Democracy from whom the red string of science originated AND Misaki\'s bff. Due to the extreme position she holds in the story you\'d think she\'d be able able to grant some clearance as to either of the afromentioned, but no. It\'s a blank state of mind in which this moody little snowflake operates, being the single biggest cocktease in existence. She is revealed a laughable 2 episodes before the finale and in that short time nothing but her backstory is provided. Oh, and that she orchestrated the entire fall of Nejima. I honestly wouldn\'t have known she was anything beyond Misaki\'s over-obsessive stalker had her MAL profile not been indicitive of something else.

Devoid of logic, full of corny scenes and dialogue that does get a bit experimental and even overboard for the standard ""By Fujoshi, For Fujoshi"" formula. Which will sadly be all but lost on the vivid fandom consisting of 13-year old girls and a few other unfortunate souls.

It is unconcluded and is the reflection that this show was very average.', ""Drama series with love as a central theme tends to draw a variety of audiences. When I seek one of these shows, relationship dynamics is something I trust for the series to capitalize. Koi to Uso (Love and Lies) is one of those series that define love more than just holding hands, dating, or kissing. It’s an anime that dances around the idea of love and drawing the audience into a world of drama.Getting into this show was actually quite easy. The premise is simple to understand and as a manga reader, I went into this show with tolerable expectations. The first few episodes easily...establishes the principle character cast – Nejima, Nisaka, Ririna, and Misaki. These four characters have distinctive personalities that makes them different from one and other. The story interconnects their lives as the setting takes place in the future. Government created the Yukari Law in which young people after 16-years old would be assigned marriage partners. So you’re probably asking thinking “hmm, a show that builds relationship through a system. Where’s the love in that?” On the surface, that logic would makes sense but it’s obvious that certain characters have real feelings for each other. For instance, Nejima has a strong attraction towards Misaki. However, his actual marriage partner is a girl named Ririna who is also interested in the idea of love. The three art part of love triangle that explores human emotions, growth, and emotional relationships.Honestly, I can’t really say this show does an adequate job at developing its story. At its core, it puts emphasis on the theme of love. The show invites questions that makes us wonder what love actually is. What is romance? How do couples build on a love relationship? Why do we feel attracted to certain people and vice versa? For starters, the first few episodes makes it clear that romantic feelings is based on attraction. However, it does get into the emotional elements soon as we learn more about the characters. Human emotions are exposed such as happiness, jealousy, fear, hate, sadness, anger, pain, and pleasure. Yet at the same time, it often feels like this series tries to do too many things at once. Every episode dedicates a variety of human emotions at once that sometimes feel too much to take in. For instance, the first two episodes explores emotions of happiness, pleasure, but also fear. Koi to Uso translates to Love and Lies and that by itself draws the attention of romance. It’s a very complex subject that even to today, there’s no right answer.By no shadow of a doubt, relationships is a very important focus in the show. The central focus is the love triangle between Nejima, Misaki, and Ririna. If we look at these characters individually, they are rather different. Nejima is the nice guy that tries this best to appeal others but sometimes makes himself look like a fool. He is what I’d label as the “Average Joe”. On the other hand, Misaki is portrayed as the ‘next door girl’ type that many guys dreams to date. However, she also has her own insecurities and often shows emotional moments when she is with Nejima. Finally, Ririna has the personality of an ice queen. She rarely opens herself to others but at the same time is fascinated by the idea of love. As Nejima’s marriage partner, it’s obvious that she also feels an attraction towards him. Yet, Ririna seems to support Nejima and Misaki’s relationship. However, I think the main problem falls onto the shoulder of main male protagonist Nejima. I’ll be honest here…he is a very uninteresting character. He’s not just average but also lacks any dominate traits as a male. He is like a beta male that always struggles to keep up with the alpha pack. Although some people may argue that he carries a lot of responsibilities (as a guy that chosen by the Yukari system), Nejima still stands out as a weak character. The guy spends way too much thinking rather than acting on his instincts. Although he takes a more initiative in later episodes, it doesn’t change the fact that his character as a whole makes him underwhelming. Misaki and Ririna stands out better as characters on their own although the lack of characterization on them holds them back. Honestly, I wish the show capitalize more on their characters individually. Surprisingly, Ririna stands out as the most interesting character in the show for me. She may be a tsundere but it’s entertaining to see how she reacts to certain situations. Remember, this show explores the theme of love and Ririna is fascinated by it. That fascination leads her to get involved in many situations in this story.Outside these three characters, we also have Nisaka, the mysterious bishounen that other girls seems to adore. His relationship with Misaki is a big question mark and it even provokes feelings of jealousy from Nejima. While I can’t really say this show has mystery, it does invite theories and questions about who he really is. Beyond that, it doesn’t seem like the show capitalizes on his character much and feels like he’s just there. That’s actually a big problem I have with the show. Every episode seems to build a bit more and more to connect the characters together but in reality, nothing really happens. It feels like a loop and nothing really is achieved in the end. We don’t really get a clear answer on who Nisaka really wants to marry in the end and to that, I can’t help but hit my head on a desk.Despite Koi to Uso being a drama heavy show, it still finds room to add comedy. Unfortunately, I can’t really praise it as it’s pretty dry and feels the same almost every episode. Misunderstandings, sexual fantasies, lewd jokes, and awkward character interactions are what’ll often see. To be honest, I think this show can be enjoyable if you feel attached to certain characters. Luckily for me, I occasionally find Yukari and Ririna’s relationship to be memorable because of their conflicting personalities and the fact that they can connect more on a personal level. Beyond that, this show feels like reading some romance novel where the author isn’t even sure on who root for.I have to admit, this show’s animation style is strange. It’s neither good nor bad but peculiar in the sense that it doesn’t look very realistic. Character eyes look abnormally big, fan service seems to happen randomly at times, and expressions seems forced. The character designs are acceptable enough with Misaki and Ririna standing out as the pretty girls at school. Nisaka also has the pretty boy look that makes him look irresistible to the ladies. Unfortunately, Nejima’s character design makes him feel out of place compared to these three. As a show with drama and romance, you can also expect kissing. Tons of it actually. By the time I finished this anime, I lost the count of times Nejima has kissed the main girls. Oh and of course, the show adds saliva and fan service during make out scenes to make them more “realistic”.Soundtrack makes me wonder if the show knows what it’s doing. It’s pretty light-toned and make scenes more melancholic than they should be. The OP and ED theme songs has some noticeable lyrics and symbolism, in particular the red strings of fate. However, what does really stand out is the character voice acting. From all the characters, Misaki probably stands out the most as her character displays the most emotions in her voice. At times, Ririna also stands out especially during tense moments between her and Nejima. Still, the other character voice mannerisms aren’t anything to write home about. Shu sounds like an emotionless doll while Nejima’s voice is just as average as his character.Koi to Uso is a watchable drama show at best and an trashy romance at worst. The show tries to get the audience invested into the characters but it doesn’t succeed with all its goals. It exposes the weakness of the story when it puts way too much emphasis into the love triangle of the main characters. Hardly anything actually happens! Not to mention, the main male protagonist doesn’t step it up to deliver a strong performance. Nejima holds the show back and is really feels disappointing after watching his role throughout every episode. Up to a certain point, I think this series’ drama is really aimed at specific audience. It's still a fine anime in general but far from perfection. By the time I finished the anime, it feels like a show that couldn’t connect its dots. establishes the principle character cast – Nejima, Nisaka, Ririna, and Misaki. These four characters have distinctive personalities that makes them different from one and other. The story interconnects their lives as the setting takes place in the future. Government created the Yukari Law in which young people after 16-years old would be assigned marriage partners. So you’re probably asking thinking “hmm, a show that builds relationship through a system. Where’s the love in that?” On the surface, that logic would makes sense but it’s obvious that certain characters have real feelings for each other. For instance, Nejima has a strong attraction towards Misaki. However, his actual marriage partner is a girl named Ririna who is also interested in the idea of love. The three art part of love triangle that explores human emotions, growth, and emotional relationships.Honestly, I can’t really say this show does an adequate job at developing its story. At its core, it puts emphasis on the theme of love. The show invites questions that makes us wonder what love actually is. What is romance? How do couples build on a love relationship? Why do we feel attracted to certain people and vice versa? For starters, the first few episodes makes it clear that romantic feelings is based on attraction. However, it does get into the emotional elements soon as we learn more about the characters. Human emotions are exposed such as happiness, jealousy, fear, hate, sadness, anger, pain, and pleasure. Yet at the same time, it often feels like this series tries to do too many things at once. Every episode dedicates a variety of human emotions at once that sometimes feel too much to take in. For instance, the first two episodes explores emotions of happiness, pleasure, but also fear. Koi to Uso translates to Love and Lies and that by itself draws the attention of romance. It’s a very complex subject that even to today, there’s no right answer.By no shadow of a doubt, relationships is a very important focus in the show. The central focus is the love triangle between Nejima, Misaki, and Ririna. If we look at these characters individually, they are rather different. Nejima is the nice guy that tries this best to appeal others but sometimes makes himself look like a fool. He is what I’d label as the “Average Joe”. On the other hand, Misaki is portrayed as the ‘next door girl’ type that many guys dreams to date. However, she also has her own insecurities and often shows emotional moments when she is with Nejima. Finally, Ririna has the personality of an ice queen. She rarely opens herself to others but at the same time is fascinated by the idea of love. As Nejima’s marriage partner, it’s obvious that she also feels an attraction towards him. Yet, Ririna seems to support Nejima and Misaki’s relationship. However, I think the main problem falls onto the shoulder of main male protagonist Nejima. I’ll be honest here…he is a very uninteresting character. He’s not just average but also lacks any dominate traits as a male. He is like a beta male that always struggles to keep up with the alpha pack. Although some people may argue that he carries a lot of responsibilities (as a guy that chosen by the Yukari system), Nejima still stands out as a weak character. The guy spends way too much thinking rather than acting on his instincts. Although he takes a more initiative in later episodes, it doesn’t change the fact that his character as a whole makes him underwhelming. Misaki and Ririna stands out better as characters on their own although the lack of characterization on them holds them back. Honestly, I wish the show capitalize more on their characters individually. Surprisingly, Ririna stands out as the most interesting character in the show for me.

Totally a matter of perception.Final note, Pretty average anime with an above average story."", 'Please note this review assumed that you have already watching Koi to Uso and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may be some spoilers in character analysis.Based off the popular manga of the same name Koi to Uso which translates literally into love and lies makes use of a theme that’s not often seen in animes which is marriage. The premise of this story is that in this world that the anime is set in Lies are forbidden and Love is doubly forbidden which sets the stage for the story. In this world as a result of population...decline the government in an effort to control this crisis comes up with a complicated plan that it hopes will solve this problem.In this plan when you turn sixteen you are assigned a marriage partner by the government thus eliminating all the work involved for a marriage as this will be taken care off. Thus, the premise here is that of a governmental marriage that is arranged by them that matches a boy and girl that reaches the age of 16 that is paired according to the compatibility of their genes.The overall plot follows the life of 15-year-old Yukari Nejima as he faces this requirement of society as he comes to age and faces the choice of whether to confess his love to his childhood crush and establish a relationship with her and break the law or agree to his arranged marriage and marry a stranger that was chosen for him.YukariYukari Nejima portrayed by veteran voice actor Ryota Osaka of Tales of Zestiria the x fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the main protagonist of the show. A 16-year-old high school boy that is just entering the age where he knows and understands what love is this is also the age where he dreads the most due to the law. Personality wise Yukari was a calm, kind and honest person that was shown to be very loyal to his friends. In the beginning of the series Yukari was also on the bit of a quiet side and had a tendency of becoming nervous when he is talking with people. Like most teenagers of his age Yukari views love with something akin to disdain and like most people dreads the fact that he will be assigned a random partner to him that he will eventually be married too. Though Yukari understands the necessity of the law and the background behind It Yukari is someone that should have the choice of choosing the person that they will spend the rest of their lives with and as a result he doesn’t hide his disdain about the law.In the beginning of the series Yukari was someone that got nervous and scared rather easily and did not like being put into situations where he will be forced to make a heavy decision that will have long lasting impacts. Indeed, when Yukari does get nervous in this early stage of his personality Yukari falls back into one of his hobbies which is making elaborate objects like funeral mounds that for some reason he has a deep interest in. These objects that he creates I feel were quite interesting to see as they are very detailed which from the level of a high school student is impressive. A peculiar trait of Yukari’s that I find interesting is that when he’s in production mode Yukari also goes into explanation mode as well and the long winded but detailed explanations that he gives on the most random of subjects was pretty interesting and funny. As the series goes on however Yukari notably gets braver as a result of not just confronting his feelings for Misaki but also develop feelings for his assigned partner Ririna as well. He also become more responsible and less of a scatterbrain and willing to shoulder the many responsibilities that he has until now been trying to escape from. This is a result of the friendships and bonds that he has been able to forge with his friends and also his assigned partner Ririna. As a character, I was impressed by Yukari’s growth and development and I was quite surprised that the weak willed and indecisive Yukari that we see in the beginning would later develop into someone that was willing to confront his feelings and be much braver than he was before. I felt that his voice actor Ryota Osaka really did a great job portraying the character of Yukari.MisakiMisaki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of the irregular at magic high school and Psycho pass fame is one of the main characters of the series and acts as one of the two heroines of the show. A high school student that is similar in age to Yukari and is also in the same class as him Misaki is considered to be the class idol as she is both pretty and kind that only serves to enhance her position within the class. A childhood friend of Yukari Misaki is a kind, honest and caring person that as a result makes it easy for her to make friends and bond with people. Apart from her base traits Misaki has also been shown to be rather perceptive and understanding of other people’s feelings especially the main character of Yukari. This I feel is a result of her being a childhood friend of Yukari’s. In the beginning of the series it is shown that Misaki while trying to remain distant is well aware of the fact that Yukari has feelings for her something that she too also has but is reluctant to commit due to the law that acts as the centerpiece of this anime. When it became apparent that their love for each other will not be able to work due to the law however Misaki’s personality starts to gradually change. Initially Misaki opted to squash the feelings of love and desire that she had for Yukari due to the friendship that she establishes with Yukari’s partner Ririna and also because she was reluctant to break the law as well content with just looking at Yukari and being with him when they are in class. However, as the series progresses however and as Yukari and Ririna’s marriage plan gets ever closer Misaki’s feelings and actions soon begin to change as she starts to resent Ririna and starts taking actions that run contrary to her earlier personality.A surprising relationship that Misaki managed to establish in the series was the friendship and bond that she managed to establish with Ririna Yukari’s assigned wife. In the beginning of the series after they met each other for the first time Misaki was shown to be friendly to Ririna but not completely hating her for being Yukari’s assigned wife instead of her. Indeed, the two of them were able to hit it off pretty well in their first meeting and gradually become good friends trading secrets and gossip whenever possible. As the series goes on this changes as Misaki’s bottled up feelings soon turn to resentment which causes her to start to take actions that will please her but trample on the relationship that she has with Ririna. This however is conflicted with Misaki’s desire to maintain the friendship between the three of them thus causing a struggle inside Misaki. The character of Misaki I felt was an interesting one mainly because Misaki herself isn’t a simple one-sided character and instead has different sides to her character that depend heavily on the kinds of feelings that she is feeling. The development of her character and the emergence of the many sides to her character I felt was done pretty well as you can never tell what she will be doing next thus adding unpredictability to her character. Kana Hanazawa I felt did an excellent job portraying the many different sides of her Misaki.RirinaRirina Sanada played by veteran seiyuu Yui Makino of Sakurada reset fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main heroines of the series. A 15-year-old high school girl of a rather rich household Ririna is the girl that was assigned as Yukari’s assigned wife as part of the selections that the red string of fate law determined. A modest, kind and intelligent young girl that as benefit of someone from a rich household also radiates a sense of elegance and nobility. Ririna is someone that can be best described as a true maiden as like Yukari she has no experience of love at all. However unlike Yukari she also doesn’t even have a crush that she longed for in the past either. In the beginning of the series Ririna like Yukari didn’t have a high opinion on the law that will bind her and Yukari together as husband and wife and indeed didn’t actually have a high opinion of Yukari either. However, as the series progresses Ririna’s impression of Yukari gradually changes as a result of seeing Yukari become braver and more willing to challenge the law that governs them and indeed by the end of the series it has become apparent that she indeed has fallen for him as well.Though Ririna’s initial personality was quiet and composed and had the elements that you will normally see in a rich girl it’s interesting to note that she has none of the usual traits of one as she is neither arrogant or haughty but is rather kind and understanding to others and always willing to listen to them. In the beginning while quiet and composed Ririna was considered by many to be hard to approach and did not really laugh much and the fact that she had a habit of speaking her mind despite the situation only served to reinforce this. As a result of meeting not just Yukari but also Misaki as well however Ririna’s personality begins to change and she gradually becomes more cheerful, happy and positive which also allows her to break out of the nickname that her school friends gave her and allow her to make her first friend. The reaction that Ririna made as she made her first friend which was Misaki I felt was actually pretty funny but also heartwarming to see. Within her personality Ririna has a number of prominent traits that serve to enhance her personality and character. One of the first prominent traits that Ririna has is the fact that despite not knowing what will happen in the future Ririna is someone that when set on a path that she is determined to follow she will follow it to the very end demonstrating how brave and determined she is. Ririna has also been shown to be a very dutiful person and willing to take responsibility for actions that she has caused something that I think is admirable for someone her age. Of Ririna’s character naturally the most prominent thing about her is the manner of how she sees Yukari and Misaki’s relationship that stems from her interest in romance novels and media. It was actually quite funny in seeing Ririna learn about what love is by trying to cause the two of them to match up. As a character, I thought that Ririna was an interesting character whose development I thought was done pretty well. Her views on love itself while unusual I felt matched pretty well with the theme of this show. I felt that her seiyuu Yui Makino really did a great job in portraying her.Arts and animationThe arts and animation for the series I felt was pretty good and I especially loved the settings of the school and the various areas that the cast go to in the series. The school during the culture festival for the school I felt was done pretty well. with regards to the culture festival I felt that the costumes that Nisaka and Misaki wore during their little play was designed pretty well and were actually pretty nice. The designs for the characters I felt were pretty good though in this regard I felt that Misaki and Ririna were the only ones that were done well. Animation wise I felt that it was pretty smooth and clear with a good balance of colors for the outfits that the characters wore.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty good with regards to both the scene music and the opening and ending themes. The opening theme for the series which was Kanashii Ureshii by Fredrick and Can’t you say I felt was especially well done and matched well with the series.Voice actingThe voice acting for the series I felt was actually pretty strong and easily one of the series best points. Kana Hanazawa who voiced the character of Misaki and Yui Makino who voiced the character of Ririna I felt deserve particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job of portraying their characters. The character of Misaki I felt was a complex character that was easy to portray but I felt that Kana really did a great job in her portrayal of her.Overall conclusionIn overall Koi to Uso was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I felt that its main strong points that made it so was its interesting premise, story, excellent voice acting and character development and its ability to provoke questions for the audience. The premise for the show naturally is the complex system that the government in the anime created and implemented. While the law itself is fictional the problem that it seeks to address with it which is population decline is not and is rather a serious problem that several countries in the real-world face including Japan. The usage of a real-world problem into an anime that was solved by a fictional law itself was an interesting premise and one that I applaud. In addition to addressing the problem of a declining population this premise also created an interesting theme of whether marriage should be happiness for only yourself or should your happiness be also to benefit the country that you live in as well. Very few animes are able to provoke such deep questions which is another thing that I like about this anime as it provokes the audience to think and look beyond the story.The overall story for the series I felt was done pretty well and I felt it was anything but simple as it was full of revelations and unexpected events. Key to this is the struggles that the characters of Yukari, Misaki and Ririna experience for the love that the three have. In particular the complex character and ever-changing attitudes of Misaki only served to make the story more and more interesting as it kept the audience engaged in trying to guess what will happen next. The friendship and bonds that Yukari establishes with Misaki and Ririna I felt was also one of the strong points of the story and seeing it evolve over the series was interesting. The central concept of the series is love and lies and in this I felt that it was done rather well though in this regard the character that best displayed it was Misaki.  The ending itself I felt was interesting and served well to show the results of the culmination of the bonds that Yukari managed to establish with both Ririna and Misaki and helped highlight the fact that love itself is not as simple as people think it is. Sometimes a lie is necessary if you want to remain happy.However, while I really enjoyed the anime and the story for it there are some things that I felt could have been done better. The character of Nisaka who is the main characters best friend within the series though a main character in his own right wasn’t given much development and indeed his relationship with Misaki and their mutual hatred for each other wasn’t explained really well. But despite such blemishes Koi to Uso was one anime that I really enjoyed thanks to the excellent premise, story and top-notch voice acting from Kana Hanazawa and Yui Makino so I would say that my final score will be a 9/10. decline the government in an effort to control this crisis comes up with a complicated plan that it hopes will solve this problem.In this plan when you turn sixteen you are assigned a marriage partner by the government thus eliminating all the work involved for a marriage as this will be taken care off. Thus, the premise here is that of a governmental marriage that is arranged by them that matches a boy and girl that reaches the age of 16 that is paired according to the compatibility of their genes.The overall plot follows the life of 15-year-old Yukari Nejima as he faces this requirement of society as he comes to age and faces the choice of whether to confess his love to his childhood crush and establish a relationship with her and break the law or agree to his arranged marriage and marry a stranger that was chosen for him.YukariYukari Nejima portrayed by veteran voice actor Ryota Osaka of Tales of Zestiria the x fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the main protagonist of the show. A 16-year-old high school boy that is just entering the age where he knows and understands what love is this is also the age where he dreads the most due to the law. Personality wise Yukari was a calm, kind and honest person that was shown to be very loyal to his friends. In the beginning of the series Yukari was also on the bit of a quiet side and had a tendency of becoming nervous when he is talking with people. Like most teenagers of his age Yukari views love with something akin to disdain and like most people dreads the fact that he will be assigned a random partner to him that he will eventually be married too. Though Yukari understands the necessity of the law and the background behind It Yukari is someone that should have the choice of choosing the person that they will spend the rest of their lives with and as a result he doesn’t hide his disdain about the law.In the beginning of the series Yukari was someone that got nervous and scared rather easily and did not like being put into situations where he will be forced to make a heavy decision that will have long lasting impacts. Indeed, when Yukari does get nervous in this early stage of his personality Yukari falls back into one of his hobbies which is making elaborate objects like funeral mounds that for some reason he has a deep interest in. These objects that he creates I feel were quite interesting to see as they are very detailed which from the level of a high school student is impressive. A peculiar trait of Yukari’s that I find interesting is that when he’s in production mode Yukari also goes into explanation mode as well and the long winded but detailed explanations that he gives on the most random of subjects was pretty interesting and funny. As the series goes on however Yukari notably gets braver as a result of not just confronting his feelings for Misaki but also develop feelings for his assigned partner Ririna as well. He also become more responsible and less of a scatterbrain and willing to shoulder the many responsibilities that he has until now been trying to escape from. This is a result of the friendships and bonds that he has been able to forge with his friends and also his assigned partner Ririna. As a character, I was impressed by Yukari’s growth and development and I was quite surprised that the weak willed and indecisive Yukari that we see in the beginning would later develop into someone that was willing to confront his feelings and be much braver than he was before. I felt that his voice actor Ryota Osaka really did a great job portraying the character of Yukari.MisakiMisaki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of the irregular at magic high school and Psycho pass fame is one of the main characters of the series and acts as one of the two heroines of the show. A high school student that is similar in age to Yukari and is also in the same class as him Misaki is considered to be the class idol as she is both pretty and kind that only serves to enhance her position within the class. A childhood friend of Yukari Misaki is a kind, honest and caring person that as a result makes it easy for her to make friends and bond with people. Apart from her base traits Misaki has also been shown to be rather perceptive and understanding of other people’s feelings especially the main character of Yukari. This I feel is a result of her being a childhood friend of Yukari’s. In the beginning of the series it is shown that Misaki while trying to remain distant is well aware of the fact that Yukari has feelings for her something that she too also has but is reluctant to commit due to the law that acts as the centerpiece of this anime. When it became apparent that their love for each other will not be able to work due to the law however Misaki’s personality starts to gradually change. Initially Misaki opted to squash the feelings of love and desire that she had for Yukari due to the friendship that she establishes with Yukari’s partner Ririna and also because she was reluctant to break the law as well content with just looking at Yukari and being with him when they are in class. However, as the series progresses however and as Yukari and Ririna’s marriage plan gets ever closer Misaki’s feelings and actions soon begin to change as she starts to resent Ririna and starts taking actions that run contrary to her earlier personality.A surprising relationship that Misaki managed to establish in the series was the friendship and bond that she managed to establish with Ririna Yukari’s assigned wife. In the beginning of the series after they met each other for the first time Misaki was shown to be friendly to Ririna but not completely hating her for being Yukari’s assigned wife instead of her. Indeed, the two of them were able to hit it off pretty well in their first meeting and gradually become good friends trading secrets and gossip whenever possible. As the series goes on this changes as Misaki’s bottled up feelings soon turn to resentment which causes her to start to take actions that will please her but trample on the relationship that she has with Ririna. This however is conflicted with Misaki’s desire to maintain the friendship between the three of them thus causing a struggle inside Misaki. The character of Misaki I felt was an interesting one mainly because Misaki herself isn’t a simple one-sided character and instead has different sides to her character that depend heavily on the kinds of feelings that she is feeling. The development of her character and the emergence of the many sides to her character I felt was done pretty well as you can never tell what she will be doing next thus adding unpredictability to her character. Kana Hanazawa I felt did an excellent job portraying the many different sides of her Misaki.RirinaRirina Sanada played by veteran seiyuu Yui Makino of Sakurada reset fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main heroines of the series. A 15-year-old high school girl of a rather rich household Ririna is the girl that was assigned as Yukari’s assigned wife as part of the selections that the red string of fate law determined. A modest, kind and intelligent young girl that as benefit of someone from a rich household also radiates a sense of elegance and nobility. Ririna is someone that can be best described as a true maiden as like Yukari she has no experience of love at all. However unlike Yukari she also doesn’t even have a crush that she longed for in the past either. In the beginning of the series Ririna like Yukari didn’t have a high opinion on the law that will bind her and Yukari together as husband and wife and indeed didn’t actually have a high opinion of Yukari either. However, as the series progresses Ririna’s impression of Yukari gradually changes as a result of seeing Yukari become braver and more willing to challenge the law that governs them and indeed by the end of the series it has become apparent that she indeed has fallen for him as well.Though Ririna’s initial personality was quiet and composed and had the elements that you will normally see in a rich girl it’s interesting to note that she has none of the usual traits of one as she is neither arrogant or haughty but is rather kind and understanding to others and always willing to listen to them. In the beginning while quiet and composed Ririna was considered by many to be hard to approach and did not really laugh much and the fact that she had a habit of speaking her mind despite the situation only served to reinforce this. As a result of meeting not just Yukari but also Misaki as well however Ririna’s personality begins to change and she gradually becomes more cheerful, happy and positive which also allows her to break out of the nickname that her school friends gave her and allow her to make her first friend. The reaction that Ririna made as she made her first friend which was Misaki I felt was actually pretty funny but also heartwarming to see. Within her personality Ririna has a number of prominent traits that serve to enhance her personality and character. One of the first prominent traits that Ririna has is the fact that despite not knowing what will happen in the future Ririna is someone that when set on a path that she is determined to follow she will follow it to the very end demonstrating how brave and determined she is. Ririna has also been shown to be a very dutiful person and willing to take responsibility for actions that she has caused something that I think is admirable for someone her age. Of Ririna’s character naturally the most prominent thing about her is the manner of how she sees Yukari and Misaki’s relationship that stems from her interest in romance novels and media. It was actually quite funny in seeing Ririna learn about what love is by trying to cause the two of them to match up. As a character, I thought that Ririna was an interesting character whose development I thought was done pretty well. Her views on love itself while unusual I felt matched pretty well with the theme of this show. I felt that her seiyuu Yui Makino really did a great job in portraying her.Arts and animationThe arts and animation for the series I felt was pretty good and I especially loved the settings of the school and the various areas that the cast go to in the series. The school during the culture festival for the school I felt was done pretty well. with regards to the culture festival I felt that the costumes that Nisaka and Misaki wore during their little play was designed pretty well and were actually pretty nice. The designs for the characters I felt were pretty good though in this regard I felt that Misaki and Ririna were the only ones that were done well. Animation wise I felt that it was pretty smooth and clear with a good balance of colors for the outfits that the characters wore.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty good with regards to both the scene music and the opening and ending themes. The opening theme for the series which was Kanashii Ureshii by Fredrick and Can’t you say I felt was especially well done and matched well with the series.Voice actingThe voice acting for the series I felt was actually pretty strong and easily one of the series best points. Kana Hanazawa who voiced the character of Misaki and Yui Makino who voiced the character of Ririna I felt deserve particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job of portraying their characters. The character of Misaki I felt was a complex character that was easy to portray but I felt that Kana really did a great job in her portrayal of her.Overall conclusionIn overall Koi to Uso was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I felt that its main strong points that made it so was its interesting premise, story, excellent voice acting and character development and its ability to provoke questions for the audience.

You have been warned.-Japan has a declining birthrate. To combat this, the Japanese Government thought it\'d be a BRILLIANT idea to create a law that forcefully marries two 16 year old kids in hopes that they\'d make kids. No mention of riots, arguments about the law, no characters even seem to question the law in general, they just all accept it as it is. So, we\'re off to a rocky start already.Our main character, who I will refer to as Paste because he\'s just a copy/paste character from every other anime, is your average teenager and anime protagonist. Boring as hell...and no redeeming qualities. Paste somehow fell in love with one of the two main love interests because he shared an eraser with her...i\'m not kidding they fall in love because of an eraser. Speaking of this eraser, FOR SOME REASON, they both have treasured this eraser for their remainder of their lives. All the way from Elementary School to High School. This eraser is basically God\'s wingman. It just has to exist for people to love each other.Anyway, Paste liked Eraser (the girl) a lot. Before he gets his notice, he confesses his feelings. Turns out they both have the hots for each other. This is when the show reveals its true colors. Eraser MOUNTS Paste on a park bench at night and just starts tongue sucking him in public.UH OH, it\'s Paste\'s birthday, he gets his marriage notice via text. And would ya lookie there, it\'s Eraser\'s name! They can straddle each other all they want from now on. But wait, the text for some reason glitched, and suddenly shows another girls name, who will be referred to as Wafer because I could go for a KitKat or something right now.Reasonably, Paste and Eraser are like ""What the heck, this can\'t be right, what happened to the text message!"" (which even if the data got corrupted, hacked, or displayed wrong it would be logged in the phone but the characters aren\'t gonna question it like everything else in this show.) Next thing you know, you have the Ministry of Hormonal Teens popping up at 12AM at night as Eraser straddles Paste and gives him an official confirmation. Not sure how they found him randomly in the middle of the night, but OKAY, we\'re gonna move forward and not question it.Thus begins the ""Love and Lie"" shenanigans. From this point on it is nothing but Wafer, who is cute as heck but dumb as bricks, putting Eraser and Paste together and watching them kiss/grope each other because it\'s interesting or something. The show also tries to complicate it by saying Wafer actually likes Paste, and doesn\'t want to admit she wants to stop making them kiss. Which if you are like me, you probably think that it is stupid.To make matters worse they introduce a gay character, who is Paste\'s friend, but also like\'s Paste. This gay character (who will now be referred to as Bae) is unfortunately the BEST character in the ENTIRE show. He actually has a personality! And he never gets the limelight. This guy actually had to tell Wafer that she liked Paste and maybe forcing him and Eraser to kiss is the reason why she feels bad...Really, the show just suffers from poor writing. Despite all the characters being on screen, I don\'t feel like I know any of them. That\'s probably why i\'m using nicknames because I can\'t remember their names. They just aren\'t memorable. The show is just a vanilla porn without the porn. I\'m not even sure if it classifies as ecchi. I\'ve said this before but the show is just overly hormonal kids getting overly hormonal in sexual situations. It\'s more awkward to watch than it is entertaining.For the positives...well, there just aren\'t a lot. It has a unique visual style. Nothing that i\'d probably remember, but something I could maybe recognize.I\'m probably being way too harsh on the show as many other people seem to be enjoying it, but I am finding hard to suspend my disbelief and revel in the world the creators put me in. It\'s just bad. Go watch Clannad if you want good bug-eyed romance.If you do watch. Remember, Bae is best character. and no redeeming qualities.

It is a romance anime without the romance. It is worse than shitcom. Worse than any other 5 minute ""WTF"" show. It was physically and mentally painful to get through this show, and I continued watching only because I am a masochist. However I would urge others to watch this show so they can have a solid basis concerning what a ""Bad"" anime is- the worst of the worst- an absolutely shit show.The first episode introduces us to the absolute worst MC of any show, let alone anime, in...existence. It is almost as if the show is self-aware because the MC openly admits how shitty he is. However instead of normal shows where the MC is being hard on himself for little to no actual reasons- he is fully deserving of the ""Worst Main Character"" award. He has no personality. He has no interests. The only times we see him on screen is when he is interacting with other characters. He has a gimmick interest to make him ""quirky"" but in reality he is 1 dimensional, boring, and totally undeserving of having very character fall in love with him. Do you want a drinking game for this show? Every time the MC makes a stupid face and gets nervous take a shot. You will die 5 minutes into any given episode (including the OP). It is the most annoying thing I have ever experienced. ""Oh no my assigned wife is in a bathing suit let me blush and make a wacky face and say *Japanese um* a lot"". ""Oh no I see my crush let me act like a little bitch and make a weird face"". ""Oh no my crush is wearing a new shirt let me make a stupid face and laugh like an idiot"". ""Oh no my crush is 50 feet away from me let me start shaking and having an internal meltdown"". UGHSpeaking about love, you should know prior to watching this show that the main romance in this show has blossomed and was kept secret because one time the MC gave his eraser to this girl because she forgot hers at home. I shit you not. This girl tells the MC that she has loved him for the past 5 years or so because of that moment. It is not as if they really interacted prior to their feelings being known. This concept is totally ridiculous. The show (poorly) sets up a setting where people are assigned who they are supposed to marry. Instead of having some intimate romance and in-depth internal struggles related to societal pressure and consequences in this made-up world: They decide to pick some cheesy interaction to make two young teens fall in love and then create a melodramatic show out of it.The setting is barely utilized and is used as a gimmick premise to create a generic harem love triangle/rectangle ""romance"". For instance, there is one character in the show who is either gay or bi. Instead of looking at what happens to gay people in this society or their internal struggles (since society would seemingly pair them with a member of the opposite sex to increase the birth rate)- they are just used as an addition to the harem cause ooh you weren\'t expecting a gay person to enter the situation did you. Another instance is in the first episode there is a message sent to a cell-phone that contradicts the married ""match"" that the MC receives. Instead of maybe using this as an opportunity to explore internal politics within this marriage assignment system they just use it to force conflict and more melodrama. Instead of exploring how society actually functions with these assigned marriages they just leave it at ""its good"" and don\'t  actually show how this society operates or the major issues within it (apart from the OP and his little harem).This only briefly highlights a major writing error in this show: Tell don\'t show. See usually when you write a piece like an essay or script for a show- you want to show ideas and concepts through actions rather than just telling about it. This show feels like it was written by a middle schooler while daydreaming and the result is the characters sounding like robots. They always have monologues that assume the audience is stupid. Instead of showing a character is mad at you through them avoiding you or through failed actions to get their attention they will have the MC talking to himself saying stuff like ""Girl #2 has not spoken to me in a week. This makes me very upset because I want to talk to Girl #2. I wonder if she is mad at me. I hope I can fix this"".Apart from the writing, the directing is like its from a hentai. There will be lots of kissing in this show. And it is very cringy. Apart from the massive cringe you will experience due to the MC not having a personality and not knowing how to interact with anyone (though they still fall in love with him because... well the writers wanted a romance ok), the kissing scenes are just... extra. They make it a purpose to show the tongues moving on each other, and they add these ""realistic"" sound effects, and they try and show the spit that hangs from the lips when they break away. Its like some form of weird form of softcore porn... but anime version.I can go on and on about all the faults in the show, but to prevent myself from writing a book on this show I will outline them here:- Generic MC to the point of being unlikable and not possessing a personality. He makes watching the show really difficult and I have never disliked a character in any book/movie/show as much as I hate him- Generic side-characters used for the purpose of having cute designs so that people can ""choose"" which character they want to win- Terrible Plot Development and uninspiring story given the premise- Unrealistic character motivations and actions- people falling in love with each other for no reason at all, at least none that we can see on screen. If anything, the show gives us reasons to hate the MC not love him.- Overly cringe-worthy scenes, directing, writing.- Boring melodrama with the plot making little progress towards the end of the show- No real conclusion at the end of the final episode- Setting and premise are not utilized to any form of their potential, instead being used as gimmicks.- No intelligent social commentary on a show that can relate to modern Japan with their birth rate crisis- Subjective opinion, but I thought the art style was... bad- Concepts are brought in to produce conflict and then forgotten about- Even without the cringe this show produces, it is just boring and meant to be watched in the background while doing something more meaningful with your time. existence.

Apart from the massive cringe you will experience due to the MC not having a personality and not knowing how to interact with anyone (though they still fall in love with him because... well the writers wanted a romance ok), the kissing scenes are just... extra. They make it a purpose to show the tongues moving on each other, and they add these ""realistic"" sound effects, and they try and show the spit that hangs from the lips when they break away. Its like some form of weird form of softcore porn... but anime version.I can go on and on about all the faults in the show, but to prevent myself from writing a book on this show I will outline them here:- Generic MC to the point of being unlikable and not possessing a personality. He makes watching the show really difficult and I have never disliked a character in any book/movie/show as much as I hate him- Generic side-characters used for the purpose of having cute designs so that people can ""choose"" which character they want to win- Terrible Plot Development and uninspiring story given the premise- Unrealistic character motivations and actions- people falling in love with each other for no reason at all, at least none that we can see on screen. If anything, the show gives us reasons to hate the MC not love him.- Overly cringe-worthy scenes, directing, writing.- Boring melodrama with the plot making little progress towards the end of the show- No real conclusion at the end of the final episode- Setting and premise are not utilized to any form of their potential, instead being used as gimmicks.- No intelligent social commentary on a show that can relate to modern Japan with their birth rate crisis- Subjective opinion, but I thought the art style was... bad- Concepts are brought in to produce conflict and then forgotten about- Even without the cringe this show produces, it is just boring and meant to be watched in the background while doing something more meaningful with your time.', 'Since everyone is hating on Koi to Uso because of the ending I thought I would write a review to show that it\'s really not that bad.First off, I found the story very interesting I have read a book series before with a similar plot of government arranged marriages so I was excited to see that played out again in a different setting. This story is all about Nejima Yukari and how he deals with his feelings for his 5 year long love and his new assigned future wife who everyone says he now has to love. If you are a fan of romance and...drama then you should definitely give Koi to Uso a try.I thought their love story was pretty different in the good way. I mean growing up in a society where loving whoever you want is forbidden and you are told to marry someone you have never even seen before? It\'s like arranged marriage backed by the science they use on online dating sites. The science part saying ""Don\'t worry you will fall in love with this person because all the data says you are perfect for each other!"" We live in a society where being able to love who you want is a big deal so this story shows you what it\'s like if that wasn\'t the case. Would you prefer to love whoever you want or fall in love with the person assigned to you?I don\'t understand why so many people are disappointed in the ending. Yes, it has an open ending with nothing totally figured out but this story is coming from an on-going manga so of course the story isn\'t going to end there. But does that make the show bad? No. It was still interesting. And in my opinion a good anime should make you want to read the source material to know more and this ending was a good way to make that happen.So all in all give it a try! It\'s an interesting take on what love really is. drama then you should definitely give Koi to Uso a try.I thought their love story was pretty different in the good way.

However, Koi to Uso is a romance show that is different from most in the best possible ways.What makes it exciting and enjoyable to watch is the unique plot and that it is impossible to tell what will happen next and how it will end. In addition, the show doesn’t shy away from sexual matters. In fact, what tends to take a typical romance show at least an entire season...to portray, happens between the MC and a female character in the very first episode. I knew after finishing the first episode that this show is unique.After 8 episodes, I am not disappointed with any aspects of the show. The characters are just as engaging as the storyline. They all have their personal burdens, and the show makes me feel invested in their struggles.Other shows this season seem to overshadow Koi to Uso because it isn’t getting the attention and praise it deserves. I decided to watch it on a whim, and I am enraptured. I’m so glad that I gave this hidden gem a chance. I highly recommend Koi to Uso if you are looking for a romance that deviates from the norm. to portray, happens between the MC and a female character in the very first episode.

You can find many love stories of this kind in novels, this is what is traditionnaly called romance in english speaking countries. Pride and Prejudice is a good example, but there are many others present in popular literature. These romances usually end well, the protagonists needing only to better understand each other to become a couple, and presumably living happy ever after.Koi to Uso is not one of this romances.It couldn't be, because what it is is romantic.What is romanticism ?Romanticism is choosing roman, the vulgar language of the people, over latin, the one of the scholars.It's about making the choice of emotions and feelings such as love, over reason.Have you ever read Romeo and Juliet ? It's pretty violent. More than that, if you try to make sense of the characters choices, they don't seem to have any. They appear to be irrational, and to a strict logical viewpoint they are.But when you try to understand the emotions they are going through, it shines a new light on their actions. Being driven by intense feelings often makes you change your perspective of what trully matters. In both Shakespeare's play and this anime, the characters have the choice to pursue an honorable mariage, that's approved by their entourage and constitutes the obviously safer bet. Why don't they follow this path and opt for the choice that seems more logical ?It's because it doesn't feel right. They function by a different kind of logic now, and their family duties ring hollow compared to the delight of spending a few moments with the object of their ardor. This love isn't a calm river, but a wild torrent sweeping everything in its path. When they're with eachother it takes hold of their entire body, whether they want it or not. It's a sweet madness, the kind that convices you you're the only one sane, and in these tales it might well be true.Be it a mortal feud between two families or a government that arranges mariages, sometimes it's the reasonable society that looks insane, and your passion the single thing that makes sense. It's become something worth fighting for, and here lies, in my sense, the statement of Koi to Uso.The show defends the idea that passion should be fully lived, however short it might be, the way fireflies are attracted to each other until their very last breath, shining all the more brightly, like a candle about to die out. It suggests us that going against societal norm might well be the right thing to do, which is a kind of subversion you don't often see in anime and especially risqué given the penchant for harmony and conformity in Japanese tradition.There you have it, why in my opinion people enjoyed this anime or didn't : a romanticism that defies reason.If you like stories about finding beauty in a doomed idyll, then go ahead and give Koi to Uso a try. a long tranquil river, flowing quietly without getting out of its bed, until finally it calmly disappears with both of your lives in the sea.This is the love of reason, the one that is compatible with duty, honor and other values, and exists in a harmony between mariage, family and society.

Will Arrange Marriage or Love Marriage win? Find out next time in KTU.[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 3/10, Art: 6/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 5/10]What do you get when you want to deal with a serious issue like Japan\'s decline in child birth & marriage but still want to attract people from various age groups to explore Love? You get Love and Lies. A show where you end up lying to others telling them how much you love...it when in reality you don\'t.The premise of the show is futuristic Japan adopts the arrange marriage policy labelling it ""The Red Thread of Science"". Where the government chooses your partner, based on ""hard-core algorithm."" The public has no clue how the math works but at age 16, you are paired up with your ""one calculated love"" and you meet up and starting sexing it up right away. They even have sexual concentration camp to facilitate the process. If you don\'t follow it you are punished with unimaginable torture. However, enter MC, Nejima, an idiot infatuated with his school crush, Misaki, who gets paired of with a tsun chick, Ririna, and thus begins the game of Love and Lies. Will the boy end up with the girl he loves or the girl he got assigned?The way the show started, it had an interesting premise. They want to explore what love really is and can one really calculate it. Even today, no one really knows the concrete answer to that despite all the online matchmaking websites with their take on different algorithms. With the central theme being love and relationships, people are easily hooked on to the show. So in the beginning the plot was interesting. They introduced the dilemma pretty early and each episode they explore different emotions associated with love, like Happiness, Confusion, Jealousy, Sadness and so on. However mid-way the show takes a huge nose dive. They introduced another character, Nisaka (a boy) who has a crush on the MC, Nejima. Now you had a 4 way love rhombus with a hint of Harem mixed in. It was really unnecessary. If they just kept the dilemma to the love triangle and explored the caveats of love it would\'ve been better imo. As the show goes on, the characters try to unearth the science behind the algorithm while figuring out who to choose in the end. Each episode ends with a bit of twist so viewers still remain motivated to watch the next episode.If the story didn\'t have enough bumps and cracks, the characters with their lack of personality and substance definitely did. The MC, Nejima, makes you viciously angry. He is too nice and too dumb who just panics at every trivial matter that makes it hard for viewers to really connect with. Then you have Mikasa & Ririna, a sappy confused girl who just loves to tease vs a tsun confused girl who just loves to be teased. Then you have Nisaka, the token closeted homosexual, to cover the void in ""Japan\'s Hard-core Algorithm"" that didn\'t account for same gender love. Overall, the characters are just too flat and hard to sympathize, with their daily struggle in finding whatever love they desire.Despite the failure in story and characters, the OP and ED songs are one of the best in this season. The background score is wonderful to listen to on its own. Although the animation at first will throw you off. I mean, we all know anime characters have big eyes, but this show takes big eyes to the next level. They almost look like aliens but I think the show creator did this to emphasize how much emotion people can show through their eyes. Regardless, the show is animated well with great CGI blending and the blue filter effect is maintained throughout the anime. The show had great cinematography and intense kissing animations that almost made it borderline hentai. Altogether, It fit the anime and gave it a soul that the story and characters lacked.Overall, despite its wonderful premise, the anime just didn\'t fully tackle what\'s better, arrange marriage or love marriage. It was sort of fun to watch each week and mid way through I wanted to drop it but glad I didn\'t because near the end it picked up once again. The characters are a bit bland and the love rhombus was sort of intriguing. However, maybe sticking to the core of the anime and exploring the emotions behind love in a more in-depth manner would\'ve done justice to this anime. Anyways, give it a watch and let me know later how you like it. Also, tell me, do you believe in love marriage or arranged marriage?P.S. Thank you for reading.

I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!', ""Koi to uso is a love drama that touches the heart, right in the first minutes of the first episode you can see where this story goes, every episode is a rollercoaster. It's the 1st anime I've seen, which shows what it is true love, passion and all the physical contacts you want to have with the person you love, not in an exaggerated way but being very faithful to reality. I can identify with the main character because I'm a little shy, but at the same time I can have friends and be happy with them and have a good relationship with the family....I'm rooting for every second that everything works out for the main character. This anime isn't about crying as there's no room for it, and instead it leaves you with a really tight grip on your heart wishing we'd switch places with the main character. This anime is among my favorites, and it's a wonder how Koi to Uso manages to represent reality so well through drawings. That's why I want to pursue design, having the dream of one day creating a story and drawings that touch someone's heart. I evaluate 10/10, here is my experience and my opinion.If you took the time to read this I would like to thank you and wish you a good day full of luck, with a lot of love Nika.

Nothing encapsulated the horrible parts of teenage drama shows more than this one. It truly is perfection, in a perverted way. So let\'s talk about all the horrible things this show has to offer. (Oh, and there will also be light spoilers)-,,Just don\'t think about it""If you don\'t think about anything. You\'ll understand everything. But if you think about it too much, you\'ll realize everything is nothing and life is pointless. I mean, you\'ll realize just how amazing this show is. I mean, it fucking sucks. The show is...filled with so many stupid plotholes, that I genuinely could not have gotten past the first episode if I didn\'t write down all the dumb stuff that happened, for satisfaction. So, just \'cause, I guess I\'ll post what I\'ve written along with this review. You can read it if you want, but it\'s not necessary to understand my other points(especially since I cut certain portions out to not repeat myself). Also, these will not make any sense if you haven\'t already seen the show.Episode 1:- Apparently, the children born after this new law had higher average intelligence, which doesn\'t make sense biologically. Did they kill off dumb people? Did everyone take an IQ test, where, if the score was too low, you wouldn\'t be allowed to have a partner? I guess ,,Red string of science sounds cool"" is good enough. We do get a little information related to this later, but not nearly enough to justify it.- Why was Misaki 4 hours late? The show\'s excuse is that she didn\'t plan to come, which is the most retarded thing in the history of anything ever (especially once we get more info about her MAD LOVE for Yukari).Episode 2:- Why didn\'t Yukari, Ririna and their families meet up in a weekend, instead of having to skip school?- Couldn\'t Yukari just call Misaki?- Ririna\'s personality is incredibly inconsistent. At the meeting, she was straightforward and friendly with Yukari (despite not knowing anything about him, not to mention the importance of that meeting) and continued to act like that through the entire episode (e.g. her interactions with Misaki), but she\'s apparently an outcast in her class and socially awkward? Bullshit. So far, she hasn\'t show any signs of being shy. Not to mention her tsundere attitude directly contradicts her ,,shyness"". This inconsistency continues in later episodes.- WcDonalds.- Didn\'t Yukari tell Ririna about all that happened between him and Misaki? There was absolutely no sign that he skipped over a part of his story to Ririna. So how didn\'t he mention he kissed Misaki?Episode 4:- They don\'t take physical preference into account. Complete and utter bullshit. There will always be teenagers who only care about how their ,,love"" looks. In that case, they\'ll hate it if the person they\'re assigned with is ugly (something that apparently the government can\'t control), resulting in a toxic marriage. It\'s a pandering way of appealing to unfit or ugly people by saying ,,It doesn\'t matter how you look, you could still get the girl you want"" so that they can project themselves more onto the show. You could say that if their egotistical personalities match, than they will both look good, but no. The show completely rejects that idea by stating people ,,don\'t fall in love with outward appearances"". Some people DO fall in love because of outward appearances and it\'s foolish to deny that.- How does a government official *forget* someone\'s address?Episode 5:- Isn\'t being carried in someone\'s arms more embarassing/sluttier than being piggybacked, especially in a swimsuit?- It was stated in episode 1 that ,,romance with anyone besides their assigned partner is forbidden"", but now, according to Yusuke\'s dialogue, you can change your partner. So, romance with someone besides your assigned partner isn\'t forbidden? Quite hypocritical.- If you could just change your marriage partner, why did Misaki and Yukari act like it was the end of the world at the end of episode 1? Could it be because that wasn\'t the original concept? The information we get in this episode completely contradicts the show\'s concept.- Why the fuck do you have to pay such a harsh penalty if you reject your assigned partner? Isn\'t it the government\'s fault if they don\'t provide you with a suitable partner? If they would\'ve actually given you a perfect match (like the government promotes these assignments), then you wouldn\'t have even thought of rejecting it. This is stupid and completely illogical. A fee would indeed make sense (as in the money spent searching for a new partner), but rejection of education and employment? What the fuck? Why? How does the government benefit from this?Episode 6:- Suddently Ririna started having a crush for Yukari, which feels incredibly rushed. Up until now she showed no signs of interest or love for Yukari (being embarassed in an awkward situation and doing tsundere shit doesn\'t count). The dream she had would not have happened if she didn\'t already have some affection for him. You could say it\'s because of what happened last episode, but, she didn\'t seem to abandon the idea of Yukari and Misaki becoming a couple (this is later confirmed).- Why is the governement shoving sex down everyone\'s throats when these kids are barely 16? All of these couples are still in highschool. Wouldn\'t it be extremely bad for their education if they got pregnant before finishing their studies? They don\'t even mention anything about the dangers of unprotected sex. Not to mention this event will be really awkward for a large number of these couples(e.g. Ririna and Yukari) since they\'ve only know each other for a couple of months (usually not nearly enough to develop a strong relationship). It would make much more sense for them to be taught this when they\'re 18 or 20 (the age at which you are no longer considered a minor in Japan) or at least have this special class be optional.Episode 7:- Why is Yusuke forced to participate in the play? There\'s absolutely no way a normal school would allow such blackmailing from the teachers (,,I\'ll knock 30% off your attendance""), especially since it was said in public. Yes, we know that Yusuke didn\'t go to school for some time, but there\'s been no indications that some of his absences haven\'t been written. In fact, the quote ,,and it\'s questionable as is"" implies that all of his absences have been written.- Why is Yukari asking Silver_hair_guy for advice? Why not his parents or close friends? Silver_hair_guy seems like the last guy he\'d want to talk to, considering all that happened.Episode 8:- If Misaki had such a large crush for Yukari, why did she have no reaction to his confession in episode 1? How could neither of them have noticed the other was constantly paying so much attention to them?Episode 10:- Yukari and Ririna could not give less of a shit about Misaki being Yukari\'s assigned wife (even though they went crazy at the beginning of the episode). First, they *forget* to ask Misaki about Shuu and then they don\'t even bother to call her, better not waste her precious time. Later, after Yukari finally gets Shuu\'s number, he writes her a message as if she forgot to give him his pen back or some shit and this is the first time he\'s talking to her (not to mention he\'s worried that he might sound SERIOUS).- Everyone doesn\'t talk to Ririna because she\'s not smiling enough. Yeah that makes perfect sense.-The ConceptI\'ve actually seen a lot of people praise Koi To Uso for it\'s concept (in a positive way), which I think is undeserved. The idea of government officials controlling relationships and love, by itself, could be really interesting. However, when the show tries to delve deeper into this concept and explain how it works, everything falls apart.First, they make the setting in modern day Japan, stating that all of this happened in less than 100 years, which kills any ,,because future"" excuse they might\'ve had otherwise (and yes, the synopsis IS lying about the setting being futuristic). Then, they imply that the government completely understands your personality by analysing your genes (which gives them 50% of your personality somehow) and then discovers the rest through tests. WHAT? That\'s so stupid. You can\'t understand someone\'s personality through fucking tests. It\'s impossible for someone to be self-aware enough to the point that they can answer every question regarding themselves perfectly. They\'re teenagers for fuck sake. Have you ever heard of narcissism or special snowflakes? What if someone lies and writes something different on the tests intentionally in the hopes of a better partner? It\'s literally impossible for them to discover if they\'re lying or not. ,,Oh no, you see, everyone will take the tests seriously because it has such a large effect on their lives"". That\'s exactly why some might lie, in the hopes of having an amazing life, not to mention they\'re goddamn teenagers. What if someone was gay (just like in the show) or asexual or a mexican? What do you do then? How does the government even know who is compatible with who? Trial and error could never work in this situation because of the infinite amount of possibilities. There are no 2 human minds identical, similar yes, but never identical. I could go on and on about how this doesn\'t make any sense, but it\'s pointless. Oh, and they also change like half the rules by episode 5 and completely abandon it by episode 12, truly story-telling at it\'s best.-The CharactersI feel like this is how naive extroverts, that never met any shy people, think of shy people. They think of them as charismatic, straightforward, but occasionally embarrassed people. Do you see where I\'m getting at? Good, then let\'s talk about each main character respectively and why they\'re so horrible.Misaki Takasaki-I\'ll say it now, Misaki is not a character. She\'s a plot device. Or, I guess you could say, a \'pander device\'. She\'s just there to be ,,the girl the MC loves that turns out to also love the MC"". The only reason we\'re given for why she loves him so much is because he seemed like a nice guy and he gave her half a razor. What the fuck? If someone gave me half a razor, I\'d think ,,Oh, thanks, I\'ll pay you back later"" not ,,Oh my god, he\'s so kind, I wanna suck his dick"". Now, It makes sense that a child would act this way. Kids be kids, you know? But a fucking teenager?! She should\'ve realized how stupid all of this is when she was 13. Here\'s the thing, if the show was actually smart, they could\'ve made her into a naive or easily manipulated character. This would make sense based on how quickly she fell in love with Yukari. Or maybe have a twist where it turns out she never actually loved Yukari and this was all part of some government plan. You know? Break the mold a little. But no, because that would mean she\'d no longer be a plot device and the show needs her to be one. She\'s there just to introduce Shuu and to be filler to complete the love triangle drama bullshit (which is quite ironic, since Ririna has the same role too). Also, the fact that she\'s 4 hours late to her meeting with Yukari (who she apparently had such a large crush on) is like the cherry on the top of the plot device cake.Ririna Sanada-This is one of the most inconsistent characters I\'ve ever seen. One minute, she\'s a full on tsundere that bitches about everything. Then, she gets all shy and flustered and doesn\'t want to talk to anyone. This character, just like Misaki, doesn\'t feel like a human being. She instead feels like a template to pander to otaku. A waifu, if you will. ""the girl of your dreams that is so shy and needs someone to save her because she has no friends, even though she\'s so nice and blah blah blah"". Her romance with Yukari is rushed beyond belief. The fact that she\'s a loner and nobody talks to her makes no fucking sense. And most of all, even as a cliche tsundere, she\'s boring as hell. I never found myself interested in anything that had to do with her. Then again, that was kind of my permanent state the entire run time of the show, but... come on! You\'re a tsundere! Do something interesting!Yusuke Nisaka-This is the best character in the entire show, which isn\'t saying much. I actually found his love for Yukari intriguing, but the show doesn\'t do anything with it. Instead, the show puts him in the ,,popular friend of the MC, that just so happened to become friends with the MC, even though the MC has no friends"" box. Apparently, he\'s also shy and doesn\'t want to be in the center of attention, which is bullshit, if you pay any attention to what he does.Yukari Nejima-Finally, the elephant in the room. Well, a tiny elephant, but an elephant nonetheless. I\'ve seen a lot of people simply describe him as a ,,generic harem protagonist"". Which is somewhat true, but because of how amazingly bad Koi To Uso is, I think there\'s a couple of things that make him stand out. First, he\'s a LOT more childish. And by childish, I mean dumb and naive. There were moments in the show were I simply thought ,,How can you be so dense?"" (I suspect the PG-13 rating to be the cause of this). His hobby for burial mounds is brought up to 11 and eventually becomes very annoying. You like burial mounds. I get it. Now can we move on and have some actual character development?. He\'s probably the only actually shy character in the entire show. But it\'s harem-shy, you know? The kind of shyness where if you walk next to him he gets a seizure.I could talk about the supporting cast, but I\'d just be repeating myself, you can already tell how boring they are just by looking at them (except for Shuu I guess).-The Art and AnimationThis is probably the worst thing about the show. It\'s not good enough to where I can admire it, but it\'\'s not bad enough to where I can laugh at it. So it\'s just in a middle section of blandness.The art is average. The animation is average. The color pallet is average. None of the characters stand out and could easily fit in any background. The background is average (if you consider how boring the setting is).  Everything is average.The only good thing I can say about it, is that it fits the light-hearted romance vibe the show is going for.-The RomanceOh boy, this is what I\'ve been wanting to talk about this entire time. Quite ironically though, this is almost my last point and this is definitely a more sensitive topic, but I\'ll do my best anyway.In my opinion, the show doesn\'t understand what true love is. Think about it. The only love that actually makes any sense is Nisaki\'s love for Yukari, because he actually knows something about him). Misaki and Ririna don\'t know jack shit about Yukari, besides ,,he\'s nice"". Heck, not even Yukari knows jack shit about Misaki and Ririna, besides ,,I\'d stick my dick in them"". True love should be caused by relating to a person and said person\'s problems and by wishing to help that person and to be next to that person for the rest of your life (At least that\'s what I think). It\'s kind of hard to explain true love, but this doesn\'t feel like true love. This feels fake love.The show constantly mentions ,,Do you want to kiss him?"" as a confirmation to whether you love him or not. In my opinion, this confirms what I\'ve said above. Just because you want to kiss someone, that doesn\'t mean you love him. You can love someone without originally wanting to kiss them. In fact, if you love someone *just* because you want to kiss them, then you probably don\'t actually love that person.I also think it\'s not right to love 2 people at once ( in this case, Yukari\'s ,,love"" for Ririna and Misaki). That\'s called cheating. And don\'t give me some bullshit like ,,Oh they don\'t mind that he\'s cheating"", it\'s still wrong.  A true partner should be just that. A single person that you love from the bottom of your heart. You usually try to devote all your time to being with your true love, especially if you\'re a teenager. You can\'t do that if you ,,love"" 2 people. You have to commit to a single person, not do this harem bullshit. I mean, if this was an actual stupid harem show, I wouldn\'t mind, but when it\'s taken seriously, that\'s where you lost me.Then there\'s sex. Which they tackled horribly. Since they\'re PG-13, they can\'t actually go all out like any other show with sexual themes (i.e. Scum\'s Wish), so they just have the characters kiss a little and then Yukari pussies out, out of getting some pussy. They never explore any of the themes of sexuality, like intimacy or lust, so what\'s the point? Why introduce sexuality if you\'re not gonna do anything with it? I\'m gonna tell you why, so that they can appear smart and mature in front off dumb teenagers. Fuck this, literally.-The Sound DesignOk, we\'re wrapping this up, but I might as well talk about the sound a little. It\'s below average.I think the OP and ED are fine. I can\'t really criticize them, since I\'m not an expert in that category, but I thought they they were mediocre and usually skipped them (although that might\'ve been caused by how much I hated the show).I think the phrase ,,Show, don\'t tell"" applies to sound as well. Every single scene, even if it\'s not that dramatic, has this loud drama music in the background and, in my opinion, most of these scenes would\'ve been much more powerfull if they weren\'t drown out with music. So, in a nutshell, fuck the OST.-ConclusionI\'m finally done with this horrible show. I could\'ve talked more about the finale and all that Friendship Is Magic bullshit, but I just want to be done with this.So, in conclusion, Koi To Uso is a horrible show with a dumb plot and bad characters. Unless you want to watch it intentionally to make fun of it (and there aren\'t a lot of things to make fun of, mostly just cringy and boring stuff), you should skip it. There are much better drama shows out there and Koi To Uso isn\'t one of them. You might as well look at paint dry and get a better experience than this. filled with so many stupid plotholes, that I genuinely could not have gotten past the first episode if I didn\'t write down all the dumb stuff that happened, for satisfaction. So, just \'cause, I guess I\'ll post what I\'ve written along with this review. You can read it if you want, but it\'s not necessary to understand my other points(especially since I cut certain portions out to not repeat myself). Also, these will not make any sense if you haven\'t already seen the show.Episode 1:- Apparently, the children born after this new law had higher average intelligence, which doesn\'t make sense biologically. Did they kill off dumb people? Did everyone take an IQ test, where, if the score was too low, you wouldn\'t be allowed to have a partner? I guess ,,Red string of science sounds cool"" is good enough. We do get a little information related to this later, but not nearly enough to justify it.- Why was Misaki 4 hours late? The show\'s excuse is that she didn\'t plan to come, which is the most retarded thing in the history of anything ever (especially once we get more info about her MAD LOVE for Yukari).Episode 2:- Why didn\'t Yukari, Ririna and their families meet up in a weekend, instead of having to skip school?- Couldn\'t Yukari just call Misaki?- Ririna\'s personality is incredibly inconsistent. At the meeting, she was straightforward and friendly with Yukari (despite not knowing anything about him, not to mention the importance of that meeting) and continued to act like that through the entire episode (e.g. her interactions with Misaki), but she\'s apparently an outcast in her class and socially awkward? Bullshit. So far, she hasn\'t show any signs of being shy. Not to mention her tsundere attitude directly contradicts her ,,shyness"". This inconsistency continues in later episodes.- WcDonalds.- Didn\'t Yukari tell Ririna about all that happened between him and Misaki? There was absolutely no sign that he skipped over a part of his story to Ririna. So how didn\'t he mention he kissed Misaki?Episode 4:- They don\'t take physical preference into account. Complete and utter bullshit. There will always be teenagers who only care about how their ,,love"" looks. In that case, they\'ll hate it if the person they\'re assigned with is ugly (something that apparently the government can\'t control), resulting in a toxic marriage. It\'s a pandering way of appealing to unfit or ugly people by saying ,,It doesn\'t matter how you look, you could still get the girl you want"" so that they can project themselves more onto the show. You could say that if their egotistical personalities match, than they will both look good, but no. The show completely rejects that idea by stating people ,,don\'t fall in love with outward appearances"". Some people DO fall in love because of outward appearances and it\'s foolish to deny that.- How does a government official *forget* someone\'s address?Episode 5:- Isn\'t being carried in someone\'s arms more embarassing/sluttier than being piggybacked, especially in a swimsuit?- It was stated in episode 1 that ,,romance with anyone besides their assigned partner is forbidden"", but now, according to Yusuke\'s dialogue, you can change your partner. So, romance with someone besides your assigned partner isn\'t forbidden? Quite hypocritical.- If you could just change your marriage partner, why did Misaki and Yukari act like it was the end of the world at the end of episode 1? Could it be because that wasn\'t the original concept? The information we get in this episode completely contradicts the show\'s concept.- Why the fuck do you have to pay such a harsh penalty if you reject your assigned partner? Isn\'t it the government\'s fault if they don\'t provide you with a suitable partner? If they would\'ve actually given you a perfect match (like the government promotes these assignments), then you wouldn\'t have even thought of rejecting it. This is stupid and completely illogical. A fee would indeed make sense (as in the money spent searching for a new partner), but rejection of education and employment? What the fuck? Why? How does the government benefit from this?Episode 6:- Suddently Ririna started having a crush for Yukari, which feels incredibly rushed. Up until now she showed no signs of interest or love for Yukari (being embarassed in an awkward situation and doing tsundere shit doesn\'t count). The dream she had would not have happened if she didn\'t already have some affection for him. You could say it\'s because of what happened last episode, but, she didn\'t seem to abandon the idea of Yukari and Misaki becoming a couple (this is later confirmed).- Why is the governement shoving sex down everyone\'s throats when these kids are barely 16? All of these couples are still in highschool. Wouldn\'t it be extremely bad for their education if they got pregnant before finishing their studies? They don\'t even mention anything about the dangers of unprotected sex. Not to mention this event will be really awkward for a large number of these couples(e.g. Ririna and Yukari) since they\'ve only know each other for a couple of months (usually not nearly enough to develop a strong relationship). It would make much more sense for them to be taught this when they\'re 18 or 20 (the age at which you are no longer considered a minor in Japan) or at least have this special class be optional.Episode 7:- Why is Yusuke forced to participate in the play? There\'s absolutely no way a normal school would allow such blackmailing from the teachers (,,I\'ll knock 30% off your attendance""), especially since it was said in public. Yes, we know that Yusuke didn\'t go to school for some time, but there\'s been no indications that some of his absences haven\'t been written. In fact, the quote ,,and it\'s questionable as is"" implies that all of his absences have been written.- Why is Yukari asking Silver_hair_guy for advice? Why not his parents or close friends? Silver_hair_guy seems like the last guy he\'d want to talk to, considering all that happened.Episode 8:- If Misaki had such a large crush for Yukari, why did she have no reaction to his confession in episode 1? How could neither of them have noticed the other was constantly paying so much attention to them?Episode 10:- Yukari and Ririna could not give less of a shit about Misaki being Yukari\'s assigned wife (even though they went crazy at the beginning of the episode).

The idea of government officials controlling relationships and love, by itself, could be really interesting. However, when the show tries to delve deeper into this concept and explain how it works, everything falls apart.First, they make the setting in modern day Japan, stating that all of this happened in less than 100 years, which kills any ,,because future"" excuse they might\'ve had otherwise (and yes, the synopsis IS lying about the setting being futuristic). Then, they imply that the government completely understands your personality by analysing your genes (which gives them 50% of your personality somehow) and then discovers the rest through tests.

There are much better drama shows out there and Koi To Uso isn\'t one of them. You might as well look at paint dry and get a better experience than this.', ""Before going in, this show is a satire towards real life issues in japan and their decreasing population...or at least i hope it is. But you make see it as a bite off of the Scum's Wish anime that aired recently and they are trying to take some of its fans. made obvious as one of the characters looks like the main character from scums wish. also it has the plot of a forbidden relationship.the plot is about a world where in order to help japans decreasing population, its government decides to pair people up with each other for marriage when they turn 16 via...some form of science called the red string of fate. this sounds ok when you first enter the show as it works but our main character falls in love before this point and the pairing up causes issues for him. he see his 16th birthday coming soon and takes the opportunity to tell her how he feels.so if you havent watched this yet the plot sounds fairly good but the execution is a little bit off for me and i will go into that with the characters.the art can be a little off for some people as its kinda combining the scums wish and generic anime art. (im gonna compare this to kuzo no honkai alot.) i not a fan but its tolerable compared to the yuri on ice bite this season (ballroom) that has the xxxholic art combined with a more outdated style. the art for this show is average at best for me.the music in this show is amazing. i love hearing it every episode and might enjoy it on its own. the opening has great art and symbolism also. if you dont like anything about this show you have to admit its pretty good.we have 3 characters this show follows with nejima being our main character. he fell in love with girl after sharing a eraser with her when they were kids which is a little creepy as he treasures that same eraser  but that girl does the same thing. her name is misaki btw. he is later assigned to ririna (his forced wife). because this show kinda falls under harem pretenses you couldve probably guessed hes a beta and its really annoying. misaki only like for his looks and you can say vice versa for him but they treat it as love thats why this show is called love and lies (lust). ririna i guess is a  normal person compared to others as she rightfully calls our beta of a main character out on his shit and test their false relationship.overall i dont care for this shows characters but put it off as this show is literally a joke.overall the show is meh. the characters really pull it down for me. i know its a joke but it doesnt make me hate them any less. the music is a huge plus but music alone is enough to get around the writting. it has a great concept but the motivations of the characters and the fact im a freedom loving American doesnt help it. 6/10, i wonder what it would be like if it was satire. some form of science called the red string of fate. this sounds ok when you first enter the show as it works but our main character falls in love before this point and the pairing up causes issues for him. he see his 16th birthday coming soon and takes the opportunity to tell her how he feels.so if you havent watched this yet the plot sounds fairly good but the execution is a little bit off for me and i will go into that with the characters.the art can be a little off for some people as its kinda combining the scums wish and generic anime art.

Even worse in the case of Koi to Uso this obstacle is a nonsensical, bullshit love mandate that threatens sanctions if broken leading to characters betraying their feelings over and over again.

His love interest is cute but she never says what she actually feels and doesn't have the resolve to fight against the system that opposes her love so who gives a damn. His fake love interest is the best character in the show bar none and she's a tsundere who, to no one's surprise, also struggles to communicate her feelings and say what she actually feels.Lets get one thing straight: This is not Kuzu No Honkai. Not even a little bit. For it to be the #1 recommended show is insanity. That anime was a thorough analysis on the psychology of sex through the lens of naive teenagers under the delusion of equating sex with self worth. Koi to Uso has no such depth to it. It's just a generic love story with a complicated narrative due to a bullshit government mandate. Characters in Kuzu No Honkai did whatever the fuck they wanted, whoever the fuck they wanted, when the fuck they wanted. There were no restrictions to their feelings. Furthermore, the art in Kuzu No Honkai was stunning. The cinematography and character designs were some of the best I've ever seen from the genre, Koi to Uso on the other hand doesn't stand out at all. For the love of god stop comparing the two.MAYBE all of this could be salvaged if the narrative wrapped up in a conclusive way that settled it's conflicts and brought a resolution to character arcs but of course it doesn't! It's literally nothing more an advertisement for the manga and screams to buy the source material rather than stand on it's own as a work.I cannot in any good faith recommend this to anyone who wants to feel any sense of satisfaction when watching love stories. Koi to Uso doesn't give you hope or joy, nor does it speak to any broader themes in an intelligent way, it just makes you upset.

From the very beginning, the show relies heavily on cliched tropes which makes everything a else feel a bit tasteless. From this unoriginal start, the series devolves into blatant wish-fulfillment surrounding a main character, Nejima, who is completely worthless. He has no traits that make him stand out, and this mediocrity is even pointed out several times by other characters.Sadly the disaster doesn\'t end there. The ending is inconclusive and is doubtlessly the worst cop-out I have ever seen in anime. It absolutely tarnished anything the show might have had going for it up to that point.Visually, the art was not bad, just pretty average; however I was put off by the design of the characters\' eyes. Even for anime eyes, they were a bit too large and had a buggy feel. Also the kissing scenes were atrocious (i.e. way too much tongue).As I mentioned earlier Ririna, unlike our hapless protagonist, is a quality character who really grew on me. She is adorable and made everything else tolerable. And the OP (""Kanashii Ureshii"" by Frederic) is wonderful and deserves a better show to back it up.

Also there were a lotta inconsistencies that were associated with the childhood friend who keeps saying that she wants to protect the guy. I mean, what and to whom is she protecting the guy from? Next there were alotta elements that shouldn\'t even be in the anime like the guy\'s guy friend who is gay and somehow wants to be part of the harem???????Now don\'t get me wrong, I like this anime story line but, it kinda looks like that this certain Musawo , who created this thing kinda takes a more complicated route, that one wouldn\'t understand as to the reasoning of the characters.Art, Fair 6.Fanservice, is only limited to Ririna where she was seen with her striped panty in the clinic and in a hot bikini , but in her school uniform?????Not Cool, Misaki on the other hand has the curve and the boobs  and is in a hot school uniform, but in a bikini?????Not good.Sound, Mediocre 5.I just have nothing to say in this category.Character, Poor 3,And the score is for Yukari Nejima, for being this indecisive fool, who doesn\'t have the balls to say ""no"" to the notice, instead he played along with the notice, until he met Ririna Sanada, now Ririna, I like her strong personality, she has guts and at the same time she has consideration for both Yukari and Misaki, but she is also as indecisive as Yuakri, where she is having a hard time of weather or not to be with Yuakri who is her assigned husband whom she knows likes Misaki and her being a single for life kind of girl, since she isn\'t the type of being liked,,,, at first that is. Now on to Misaki Takasaki, she loves Yukari, but she keeps coming up with such reasoning that one wouldn\'t understand, I mean she has such complication, that can\'t be comprehend. Now Nisaka Yusuke...he\'s gay, good thing, he\'s limited to the sides.Enjoyment, Good 7.Frankly I was the hoping that Yukari would have the balls to be decisive as to whom he will choose, that kept me glued to follow up this thing up to the last episode, but..............Overall, Poor 3.It ended in an open ending, where it looks like the guy can have both , be with his assigned wife and have a concubine at the same time.

Thrump OUT!!!!!!!', ""To sum it Up This Anime is a perfect example of what happens when you make an anime adaptation of a Manga and don't even have enough source Material to begin with. Due to the Manga still being at seemingly the 1/2 way point of its production/storyline this was to be expected. The anime changes quite a few key factors that the Manga had in an effort to try to shape its own ending but unfortunately they do this terribly too late at like the last 3 episodes which leaves the entirely Made up anime conclusion feeling extremely empty and unsatisfying. The Whole premise of...this anime/manga was him having to choose his true love and essentially go against his fate to pursue his original true love which is shown in 3/4 of the anime. However towards the end it essentially betrays that entire plot by (SPOILER BE WARNED) having the MC end the last episode by basically choosing both girls and going the Harem Route. The main problem with this isn't necessarily that he chooses both but rather that it seems so forced because they made the ending up on the spot with almost no foreshadowing of this being his end goal/choice so it comes off as unfulfilling to the viewer. In conclusion this anime had a ton of promise early on and a great synopsis but ultimately falls short due to the lack of Original source material resulting in a half-hearted ending. All in All i give this anime a 6/10 with potentially a higher score if they ever make a S2(unlikely) to flush out the actual storyline. this anime/manga was him having to choose his true love and essentially go against his fate to pursue his original true love which is shown in 3/4 of the anime.

It seemed fairly interesting at first so I clicked on the first episode after reading the synopsis, the first episode was decent, what could go wrong? Answer: Every. Single. Thing.Okay so, the series starts off with the plot being introduced in the first episode, it did good in that aspect of revealing the plot, but everything fell apart from there.To give insight on what I\'m gonna be talking about the characters first, since it\'s a character driven story.Another disclaimer: This review has heavy sarcasm, and I do not intend to come off as harsh.Characters: Protagonist: A Shinji Ikari. Whiny, weak, doesn\'t know how to make decisions, stupid, dense and literally everything the protagonist of a harem could be. Like I get it, he\'s shy, does he have a personality other than that? No. The amount of times I cringed at him is too much, I get that most Harem protagonists are like this but some atleast add some sort of personality to them. Protagonist: 1/10.Now I\'m going to be talking Misaki, the girl whom the protagonist likes (don\'t worry it\'s not a spoiler), she looked good at first, I mean she did have like a very cliché personality but I went in with an open mind expecting something else, I did get something though! Fan. Service.She\'s like the typical ""nice girl, looks good, is popular, gets good grades, everyone loves her"" I just explained her entire personality in 12 words, that\'s how much little personality she has. Did they try to re use the trope and make it her own thing? No. Misaki: 1/10Now the other love interest that the protagonist is met with, I won\'t diss her, she\'s a well written character for something like this but still, could\'ve been so much better than a fan service tsundere. 2/10. Now as for the protagonists best friend, he\'s gay, that\'s nice, does he a have a personality? Yes! He does! Okay this character is pretty well written, I need to give them credit for that but my problem is, what does he contribute to this story at all? I literally don\'t see the point of his existence, ""I mean he\'s gay and he\'s charming so that personality in itself xD xD xD"" . 4/10, only if could\'ve contributed something to the story, boy would this anime be at least a 5.Now, lets talk about how bad the ""comedy"" aspect of this show is.It isn\'t comedy, it\'s just a wacky highlight, there\'s a difference between the two. I remember cringing instead of laughing at the ""comedy scenes"", they didn\'t try in this aspect at ALL. Why even call it a comedy? I mean, since it\'s a slice of life there just HAS to be some sort of comedy or else how can you even it call it that? Right?As for the slice of life aspect, it was decent, expect they used the ""beach episode"" trope for some good ol\' fan service. Was the beach episode interesting or at least add something to the progression of the plot or characters? No. Just tits.And they also used the cliché of the miscommunication happening between the protagonist and his/her love interest. That made me real mad real quick, and I skipped that episode since I can\'t sit through that.The story was so interesting at first! Why would they destroy an original idea like that? I don\'t know, every SoL just HAS to have tits or it\'s not an anime. It could have been SO much better, they could have removed the comedy aspect and made this more of a drama and plot driven story instead of comedy and slice of life. Those two aspects of this anime do NOT fit the theme and story at all! The characters could have been written so much better. Other than the protagonists best friend (who doesn\'t add anything to the story) I literally don\'t see any originality at all. It\'s disappointing how such an original concept which seemed so interesting at first quickly turns into clichés, tits and beach episodes. It\'s sad, honestly.Also, I\'m just gonna talk about the ending, ""what the fuck"". That\'s what I think about it. I mean sure polygamy is cool and all but like, mate, if you can\'t even do that right then don\'t do it! Like it\'s stupid, un-satisfying (at this point nothing can be done to salvage this), they could have ended it by making protagonist choose neither or ONE of the, polygamy doesn\'t fit the theme. Ending is just, pathetic dude.Art: decent, the characters looked aesthetically pleasing so at least that\'s something.Overall, could\'ve been better. on the story-In the future the government chooses your romantic partner for YOU. It seemed fairly interesting at first so I clicked on the first episode after reading the synopsis, the first episode was decent, what could go wrong? Answer: Every. Single. Thing.Okay so, the series starts off with the plot being introduced in the first episode, it did good in that aspect of revealing the plot, but everything fell apart from there.To give insight on what I\'m gonna be talking about the characters first, since it\'s a character driven story.Another disclaimer: This review has heavy sarcasm, and I do not intend to come off as harsh.Characters: Protagonist: A Shinji Ikari. Whiny, weak, doesn\'t know how to make decisions, stupid, dense and literally everything the protagonist of a harem could be. Like I get it, he\'s shy, does he have a personality other than that?

Based on a compatibility calculation, young people at the age of 16 are assigned marriage partners by the government, with severe repercussions awaiting those who disobey the arrangement.This anime was pretty bad for a romance but I won\'t spoil anything so I\'ll just list off my rating.Story: 4 Very predictable and tacky kinda left a sour taste in my mouthArt: 6 Big eyes in anime only worked for clannad because of its compelling story and character developmentSound: 8 Literally the opening song...is the reason why I even tried watching this anime, it\'s too god damn LitCharacters: 6 For the most part the characters were bland and only developed personalities because of their ""true love"" and even then they barely changedEnjoyment: I\'d give it a 5, the end was extremely disappointing and extremely predictable but nevertheless I was still somewhat satisfied with the ending, I hope the OVA might offer incite into what happens or a little glimpse of what happens laterOverall: 5.8 but we\'ll round it to a 6 is the reason why I even tried watching this anime, it\'s too god damn LitCharacters: 6 For the most part the characters were bland and only developed personalities because of their ""true love"" and even then they barely changedEnjoyment: I\'d give it a 5, the end was extremely disappointing and extremely predictable but nevertheless I was still somewhat satisfied with the ending, I hope the OVA might offer incite into what happens or a little glimpse of what happens laterOverall: 5.8 but we\'ll round it to a 6', ""I started the anime by the unusual plot for a shoujo, but now I finished the anime feeling very disappointed.The government arranged marriage could have been better developed with the realationship between the characters, but, in fact, there's nothing but a cliché story.The art is amazing. I love the eyes and the colors looks of the characters. By the way, Ririna and Takasaki were really pretty good designed. But that alone doesn't support the weak script and I feel sorry for that.(spoiler alert)Ultimately, I do not know, guys, but I also don't like / understand the end. Are they going to make...a trio or what? Okay, there are so many couples with one more person, very modern. But, wow, Negima is a fool and did not deserve to be with the two girls after all that happened. That way, I'd rather Ririna and Takasaki ending up together haha a trio or what? Okay, there are so many couples with one more person, very modern. But, wow, Negima is a fool and did not deserve to be with the two girls after all that happened. That way, I'd rather Ririna and Takasaki ending up together haha"", 'You walk to your boring, mundane job with your head down thinking it\'s just going to be a normal workday where nothing happens.\xa0 On your way to work, you pass by this beautiful, stunning girl that catches your eye.\xa0 Without word or warning, you run to her, heart beating, wanting to see or know more about this strange maiden that you just happened to go by.\xa0 That...is love.\xa0 Or rather, that\'s a common, idealistic idea of \'love\'.Story: In reality, the subject of love is messy business, where commitment and relationships are tested only to end in separations and heartbreak.\xa0 To counteract this, the Japanese government...has enforced a policy where everyone is assigned a marriage partner with positive statistics showing that this method ends with happy marriages and better, healthier people.\xa0 It\'s here where we meet our main protagonist who, despite having an arranged partner himself, attempts to defy the system by trying to chase after the feelings he\'s harbored for another for several years.With the interesting situation of natural love vs. artificial love when you compare the two situations against the corresponding results (aka ending poorly and ending successfully), Koi to Uso presents us with an interesting predicament that doesn\'t get the execution that it deserves.\xa0 While the show does initially present the characters\' problems in an interesting light and really throws the audience in for a loop with what happens, everything after the beginning two episodes ends up spiraling in a mildly interesting yet disappointing kerfuffle that every so often reminds us that the show has this really great premise only to not go into it that deep as it continues with more middling and slice-of-life routine.The only really interesting parts occur when the show presents us with the mystery surrounding the hidden structure of the arranged partners, as the show\'s main conflict is derived from an unclear government mishap.\xa0 But once again, the potential is wasted because nothing actually gets answered.\xa0 Like its source material, the show ends up being more aggravating than interesting because every scene not pertaining to the main quartet having fun only adds another layer to everything without clearing out what\'s underneath.\xa0 Like a really bad board of Tetris.To describe this show would be in a word...unsatisfying.\xa0 Quite honestly, Koi to Uso is a show that ultimately has no payoff for its viewers because even with the ending of our main character actually deciding what he\'s going to do in regards to his \'natural love vs. artificial love\' conflict, the show doesn\'t make a convincing argument for his decision because not only does the show seem to have more than it\'s willing to let on (which it does.\xa0 I will attest to that), but the protagonist himself doesn\'t seem that convinced of the end result because the show apparently hates being definite on its own argument.Overview:+ Really interesting story idea-\xa0 Poor execution-\xa0 Unsatisfying ResultsCharacters: If I may be honest, having the unsure, spineless harem protag as your main character\'s trope is probably the worst things to have as a main character with a story concept like this.Aside from being obsessed with burial mounds, Nejima Yukari\'s only other quality is the fact that he\'s so unsure of himself of who he likes that it becomes the show\'s main hinderance.\xa0 Indeed the trait is necessary, as the show attempts to showcase the benefits of both arguments with natural love being organic and following your heart while the arranged notices are statistically better and have happier marriages.\xa0 As such, him being unsure with what he wants with the two options placed in front of him makes sense.\xa0 But at the same time, it\'s really hard to make that argument when your protagonist is so damn passive.\xa0 As a character, Yukari stays on the sidelines and let his fellow cast members, or anyone else for that matter, dictate the plot because he doesn\'t make his own decisions.\xa0 A protagonist is meant to dictate the story, drive the plot so that there\'s some kind of direction that the story should be heading.\xa0 He doesn\'t do anything, and because he doesn\'t do anything, we\'re left with a piddling mess of what could\'ve been.For ""natural love"", we have Takasaki Misaki.\xa0 For ""artificial love"", we have Sanada Lilina.As the target of Yukari\'s affection for several years, Misaki poses as one of the show\'s problems simply due to the fact that nothing about her is told.\xa0 Sure we know that she loves Nejima, but that\'s IT.\xa0 The show is so secretive about her past and the various actions she takes in the show that it becomes so fucking aggravating to watch.\xa0 Imagine two of your close friends laughing at something and when you ask them what\'s so funny, they say \'nothing\' with a smile.\xa0 Now imagine that like...thirty times.\xa0 That\'s basically Misaki\'s entire character arc for the entire twelve episode runtime.\xa0 There comes a time in every story where you do have to spill the beans, damnit.As for Lilina, the show paints a surprisingly better picture of her despite the show really trying to shoot for the \'natural love\' agenda with her character.\xa0 Regardless, as Nejima\'s assigned wife, Liliana learns of Nejima\'s love and wishes to learn what \'true love\' is, going so far as to tell Nejima to chase after Misaki so she could learn what natural love is like.\xa0 The show even goes to the extent of giving her a more detailed and involved backstory (comparatively) to both of her main counterparts so the viewers resonate with her, as well as basically giving her among other side characters the active role in the situation.\xa0 She is what basically drives the plot and yes, while I do like her character, as we see her change over the course of the series (which is more than can be said for her \'hubby\') the burden is too much to bear on her little shoulders.Then there\'s...Nisaka.\xa0 Honestly, Nisaka is a side character.\xa0 While yes he is involved with the quartet, he doesn\'t really do anything or have much of a presence in the series.\xa0 There is one particular scene that does give him some kind of definition as to what his stance on everything is like, but he, like Misaki, is so wrapped in secrets that it\'s not even worth bothering with because you already know that you\'re never gonna get answers.\xa0 Hell, there\'s supposedly history with him and Misaki, and it\'s so vaguely touched on that it might as well not have EXISTED.Side characters range from side cast who really don\'t matter in the grand scheme of things, and government workers who really would\'ve made a better story with Koi to Uso\'s concept.\xa0 There\'s also Shuu who again, is wrapped in mysteries that\'ll never be solved.\xa0 Yes, yes, I\'ve repeated this many times, but repetition is really about the only way for me to irritatingly drive in the point that this show has far too many unanswered questions.Overview:+ Lilina is a decent character+/- The government workers would\'ve made a much better version of this story-\xa0 Far too many \'mystery\' character traits-\xa0 Main character doesn\'t do anythingArt: Produced by Lidenfilms, Koi to Uso has a light and clear artstyle with a relatively glossy look in order to really give the show that finishing touch.\xa0 It\'s a nice style that\'s very appealing to the eye and has few and far between faults that aren\'t really all that noticeable.Occasionally the show goes on different spectrums with occasional simple artstyle moments to add comedy to a certain scene, or blacken the whole screen and fill it in with a couple pictures to drive in a metaphor to the situation.\xa0 Quite honestly, the art is rather flexible and is one of the more positive points of the whole thing.Overview:+ Good, clean artstyle+ Flexible to fit the story point\'s needsSound: Honestly, the soundtrack for Koi to Uso is...kinda weird.\xa0 ""Kanashii Ureshii"" is a poppy rock song that while yes has an interesting beat that makes it actually quite memorable, doesn\'t really fit with the show.\xa0 It\'s actually quite fun to listen to cause its beat is so clear that it\'s like a song you bop your head to.\xa0 My question is, why is this kind of song in a romance/drama?\xa0 It\'s a good song, but it doesn\'t really make sense for a show that\'s supposed to be about the trials and tribulations of falling in love.On the flipside, ""Can\'t you Say"" is a lighter and softer song compared to its OP counterpart, as not only is it a good song, but vaguely fits more with the supposed \'drama\' theme.\xa0 Both tracks are pretty good and are honestly worth a listen to at least once.\xa0 They just feel like they\'re part of the wrong show.Overview:+ Good, somewhat memorable tracks-\xa0 Why are they in this show?Personal Enjoyment: The original manga has like six to eleven pages a chapter.\xa0 Literally the moment something good was gonna happen, the shit just ended.\xa0 However even with roughly eighty normal length manga chapters put into a twelve episode anime with a majority of the fat cut out of it (trust me, they cut out A LOT), the adaptation really brings to light why I\'ve grown so disinterested with the series.Nothing is in a rush to get resolved, and the slow crawl is so painful that I want to cry because an idea like this is wasted on such a horrendous plot that hates resolution.\xa0 My theory is that they just don\'t want either one of the waifus to lose, so they drag the story along on this seesaw of death that swings side to side on which girl will win.\xa0 It sucks, but I\'ve invested too much time into this, so I\'m not stopping even though I should.Did I enjoy this anime?Rather than enjoy the anime, I enjoyed more of understanding why I like Lilina as a character.\xa0 Compared to almost everyone else, she actually does something and has more than just one or two traits that aren\'t held under wraps and wraps of secrets to be revealed at a later time.\xa0 Plus she\'s the cuter one of the two so yeah, I like her more.What didn\'t I like about this anime?While I did complain about a multitude of things, Yukari especially is such a boring and nonsensical character.\xa0 He has almost no traits to him.\xa0 That is worse than having an unredeeming trait.\xa0 At least with shit asshole characters, they give you a reason to hate them.\xa0 This guy however gives you no reason to care for him.\xa0 And he\'s the main character.\xa0 So you end up hating him because he has no reason to hate or like him.Would I recommend this anime?Aside from maybe the first two episodes, Koi to Uso really isn\'t a show worth investing time into.\xa0 The show is so devoid of anything useful in its presentation of its central conflict that it almost becomes insulting to the viewer because it pretends to be clever when in the grand scheme of things, NOTHING IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.\xa0 As such my recommendation is to just...skip it.\xa0 A good concept is one thing.\xa0 A good execution is something entirely different.Also I got cheated out of my sex scene again, so I\'m still pissed

But lemme tell ya, it went from a cool idea to change drastically into a horrible fail.Before it bombed everything I really was hooked by the beginning, the first episode felt like their was something bigger there and was really dramatic. The art through the whole show is fantastic, it fits the story they are portraying. And the sounds was nice too. But other than that the later you get in the show, and the dreadful ending as well, it...really leaves more to be desired.By the ending of the show, I knew sadly that, a show that I really wanted to be successful, just wasn’t gonna happen so before you get into this mess of a show, think about it! really leaves more to be desired.By the ending of the show, I knew sadly that, a show that I really wanted to be successful, just wasn’t gonna happen so before you get into this mess of a show, think about it!', '*This review contains spoilers*Koi to Uso AKA Love and LiesThe product of bad writing. That really does sum it up. Someone had a pretty good idea for a manga but had the logic and thought processing of an elementary student.The society has low birth rates so in order to stimulate the population the government decided to enforce a law where arranged marriage is mandatory for everyone at the age of 16.The main character is Yukari AKA Beta Male nice guy #45608 AKA the self insert AKA the Target Audience AKA YOU. In Elementary school he was sitting next to a cute girl...and she needed an eraser... he had one of those big erasers that are for really big mistakes and broke it in half and give a piece to her. She said thank you to him and ever since then Yukari has been in love with this girl...5 YEARS LATER he is still going to the same school as the girl, but has never talked to her since.

Not because of the pacing but mainly the characters choices or actions throughout the show. I was expecting something different. Less teen drama and more focused on the government actions and consequences, mainly for characters like Nisaka.The ending was not satisfying but I kind of expected it because Nejima is a horrible character.ArtThe art style fits the story, I guess. Even though, I must admit I find it so much interesting than the plot itself. The characters designs are cute and in some moments really well-made, mainly on...the emotional scenes. However, I would have preferred less fanservice regarding women’s chest size (Misaki). I get it the girls are beautiful, the boobs do not need to get any bigger on each episode.SoundCharacters voice actors were, as usual, really good at conveying the mood and emotions. The soundtrack in general fitted every scene but nothing extraordinary. I did downloaded the opening because I really enjoyed the music. It’s catchy and I did not know at the time, but it gives you the vibe of this show. What I mean is, I was expecting something more serious and complex but in reality I guess it was focused on lame characters.CharactersOh the characters. Where should I begin?

Although, I must admit it’s not entirely his fault that some things happened but who I am kidding? This is one of no good for nothing character that somehow is loved by several different characters.He is in love with Misaki Takazaki but his assigned wife decided by the government is Lilina Sanada. However, he decides with Lilina support to keep pursuing his first love. He knows there will be consequences and also is aware that he is being unfair to Lilina even if she is also messed up. Others describe Nejima as a good person but in reality I just think is being naïve, unfaithful, dense beyond what can be acceptable and selfish.Misaki Takazaki is not naïve or dense and she should be aware how terrible person she really is. Pretending or even believing she is a good friend to Lilina and at the same time, teasing, kissing and confessing her love to Nejima. Even if Lili said it was okay and it was supporting them because of their true love, I don’t care. It’s wrong. Even worse when she knows Nejima and Lilina might have being developing feelings for each other. She keeps that to herself.To some extent I can empathize with her. I can even feel sorry for her but I cannot accept her actions. I know being a teenager and all, we are more prone to make bad decisions but still…Then, there is Lilina Sanada who is completely messed up. I can’t understand what is going on in her head. I know she is not comfortable with the assigned husband thing or people in general but that cannot justify everything. I want to feel sorry for her but at the same time, I hate how they built her personality.My favourite character and the one who I truly feel sorry is Nisaka Yusuke. Okay, his love interest is not fascinating at all but love is not rational. However, Nisaka is truly caring and unselfish. Nisaka knows if he followed his heart alone without thinking about the repercussions it would not only affect him but also the one he loves. Therefore, he is hiding is own feelings and also remembering other characters what will happen if they do not follow the government orders.For him is even worse because the idea of a perfect matching in order to improve a low birth rate in the country basically ignores the existence of people that might be homosexual. So, in my opinion, this perspective if more interesting than that BS that’s going on between Nejima, Misaki and Lilina.EnjoymentIn each episode, I would read the comments section and conclude that there were things different from the manga.

It casts them in a very dark light and really does ramp up how people, like our main characters, are going to struggle against the system. This creates all sorts of fantasies and possibilities for us, the viewers, for the story and anime itself overall.There was also a hint of diversity as tsundere best friend Yuusuke Nisaka is actually gay. Well at the very least, bisexual because he does kiss Yukari while he is sleeping and then we get a monologue about how he lies to himself at...the end of the series. It is important because there are many MOGAI individuals around the world and they don’t just disappear in a situation like this. True, it would have been better if they would have explored this more in depth, but that is not this author’s M.O.The music for the anime was rather cute as well.

So give this show a chance...and watch it:) and watch it:)', ""~Koi To Uso (Love and Lies) ReviewStory: 7/10The story is actually one of the most original stories of this entire season, with a premise that is actually golden. The only problem is that it doesn't feel much like anime. It feels more like a drama live action show that was too expensive so they animated it. Or at all they should have probably made this a movie instead. But even still the story so far is enjoyable and is a very stable concept. One of the best of the season!Art: 9/10Now this is a nine for one reason. It's unique, most anime watches are very...used to the average anime character style. While this just brings in a new fresh idea to life, honestly I could have honestly dropped this but decided to just for the story not the art. At first I hated the art but then the differences with the art and story of the season seem to make sense and adds more emotion the character concepts. Very well done.Sound: 9/10The sound in the series so far is studio quality, though sometime it's a bit obvious it was recorded across the room of a studio. Even still the VA's were picked beautifully and added to the character's like a glove.Character: 7/10The characters are special in a good and bad way. But comparing it to the anime series that I have seen so far make this a more or less average high school drama. Which is good but also means that the characters don't have anything special or interesting about them. Luckily the story covers this and makes it more understandable and watchable.Enjoyment/Overall: 9/10This is one of the rare gems of the season, though it is not better than the other jems like SukaSuka (WorldEnd: What do you do at the end of the world) Which had this Ghibli feel to it and an Arrietty quality, this series redeems  itself and I can't wait to see what happens next! used to the average anime character style.

I do agree that it has its flaws, and that it is a 6/10 show at best for people who watch it just for the sake of watching it, but i found it very enjoyable and immersive under right conditions. So here are some questions to ask yourself before watching it:Have you burned out with action anime?Do you want to make your heart giggle?Have you watched all the other generally well praised romance anime?If all of the three answers are yes,...then I would highly recommend this show! The whole show managed to capture my attention and made me watch it in a single binge. The one thing I noticed that this anime does better than some of the well known anime is emotion. Every interaction between characters glows with emotion, especially those silent and intimate moments. In my opinion this show captures emotion like none other. Although many great anime start to build up emotion just to put me off completely by annoying characters (e.g. Banri from golden time). I really couldn't get annoyed by any of the characters, which I found really surprising. The MC still looks annoying and has an annoying voice, but he manages to make some semi-rational decisions.Idk if this is a spoiler but just in case read carefully!The only thing that bothered me in this anime is the ending. The whole show is based and rooted on the idea that some kind of decision MUST be made, and that decision would eventually lead to hurting the other side. So it really put me off when there suddenly appears the alternative path where everyone is happy. Someone else might enjoy such an ending but I don't feel the same way.But the rest of the show was so enjoyable that I can overlook the ending. then I would highly recommend this show!

It just feels like a tragic love story and the symbolism through Romeo and Juliet, the idea in class to reject government control as part of teenage rebellion, and a government so threatened penalties are in place for rejecting a match, makes it very interesting to me and not something I had seen anime wise before.I found it easy to empathize with some of the characters, as they were forced together almost, with no real knowledge of each other, no real...feelings, and no real experience when in my case parents tried pushing us together.   There is an uncomfortable feeling about the parents are living vicariously through you for the mistakes they think they made, or for the stability they have seen others gain from it.   It ignores the feeling, the emotion and in honesty, if this really happened in Japan I would expect it to be a failure.The problem is for Japan it doesn't treat the underlying circumstances of why people don't get married, or why people don't have kids, like money, job security, time from work, with people even sleeping where they work, or unable to commute home where they live a certain way due to income, hours, etc.The hard part as this anime showed, is when someone shows their feelings and they are reciprocated it is so hard just to put the cork back in the bottle, It hurts, it eats you up inside at stages when you can't be with the one you love, and sooner or later people around you notice, which seemed mysterious with this, as most people didn't.It is the same as what was said, you will love him when you get to know him, and for someone who has been at an all-girls school, with no friends, and no male companionship; it felt like an easy target.    The perfect target to fall in love, as so alone, and innocent, so easier to impress or charm.   When the arranged wife was to push to see him with the one he loves, it almost seemed out of curiosity and exploration for feelings she had never had or seen and it was so easy to be interesting in them, even if suppressing desires not to hurt someone.It just felt when she realized what she was losing, and could feel the pain even if wanting to help her friend, it felt a bit weak and delayed.   The problem is when you realize you love someone, often is this desire to do anything to keep them, even things you wouldn't normally do, and that just felt absent; leaving the oblivious guy to be pushed along, by seemingly the boy who loves him too.For me I loved what felt like a unique idea of a story, however, I didn't believe such a system could ever work or be accepted.   The weakness in the story for me was in regard to the relationships and how I would be keeping someone away from the person I love, even if the friend meant a lot to me, as I wouldn't want someone taking my place, and to me, that's the crux for me.    Even as feelings increase, the girls stay together or talk, and to me, it just didn't mimic human behavior and that's mainly the author's fault and continues with how he plans to end the manga.I just felt the characters were flawed, with the government watching these people in such relationships, the chance to be caught would be huge, and how sooner or later, all these unresolved feelings would just blow up.

But it's more than that, really.While the synopsis or the characters are mostly generic, the human interactions in Koi To Uso catch the most fundamental part of human connection - honesty. Their naivete allows them to talk from a free, genuine place, and even though it is sometimes cringy, I find it truly amazing.And yes, the show is not perfect. There are some problems with the portrayal of love, lust and consent in the anime, and some generic backstories or forced conspiration subplots,...but there are great parts too.I found the portrayal of sexual identity and sexual presence in daily life quite accurate (and also wildly inaccurate), but as a teen that's experienced them both, I could really relate.For me, as a guy, the boys were also very relatable, and I think this exploration of gender identity really cheered me up as I get ready to tackle my own.I am sometimes very Yukari, but I have the biggest crush on Yusuke.In conclusion:Koi to Uso is a short, light anime. It is, in a lot of ways, quite average, and in many other ways, problematic. But most importantly, it is an honest display of friendship and human emotion, one which I found myself relating to very easily, and it is a magically captivating series, that makes for a great binge.

As the anime carried on, it brings much more homour, cringeness, some minor explicit scenes, one scene of BL, but in my opinion the anime is mainly melancholic. Humours in the sense that Yukari Nejima is being asked to kiss his crush by his assigned wife, which was cringy as well. But, hey, she only knows romance though reading and watching shows, but never experienced it hence has no idea of the concept of ""love"". Hence it is alright for her to say this only to find herself a bit annoyed in the end, isn\'t it?Only the ending, might have ruined the enjoyment of the story, as it shows a stubborn characters and sacrificial mentality, keen to choose two girls together and what not, which might not be liked by some people, and they could have covered a bit more of the manga to cut off that disappointment.

The timing and the covering content was bad there.And yes, I highly recommend to read the manga more than watching the anime, or immediately after watching the anime to get a good idea of the story and to cut off the disappointment you might have after watching the anime.

The storyline covered in the first season might look a bit disappointing, as usual that some manga have some disappointing scenes at the start and as we go on it gets really beautiful.

But first, allow me to back up to the beginning of this anime.Koi to Uso on the surface has an interesting, compelling plot. However, by the first two episodes it seems to just be a cliche, standard romance anime. But this image is quickly swept away by episode three, where we see it\'s true intentions-- or so I would think. But no. Really, all this anime is is a cliche, standard romance anime with a load of melodramatic scenes and the worst possible ending.I won\'t delve into the...story, the art (which in contrast to the rest of this anime is very good) or anything like that. Rather I\'ll simply say that this anime is fucking shit. Literally every episode one of the girls is crying those good ol\' crocodile tears but we\'re actually supposed to take them seriously. And for the first few episodes, I did-- but that changed the second I realized that they appeared in almost every single episode. Heck, they may as well have names and characterization now.Not to mention this series is frustrating as hell, as it leaves people like me hopelessly wishing that MAYBE something actually interesting would happen such as Yukari turning out to be a psychopath, or Yukari falling in love with Nisaka but NO. Rather I have to sit through episodes that are dragged out with the same boring shit again and again, waiting and waiting for them to be over so I can actually go watch something quality. The funny part of this is that I actually really liked this series when I first started watching it-- but when every episode is filled with the same shit, I just begin skipping past them.Actually, I learned throughout this series that the second I see Misaki or Ririna on the screen, I just skip past it. Skip past it and hope Nisaka will make an appearance, or maybe Misaki and Ririna will find solace in each other instead of fucking flip-flopper 101 Yukari. Literally, Yukari goes from one moment saying ""I\'ve always loved Misaki"" to the next saying ""My love for Ririna...""What the fuck. Make up your goddamn mind instead of playing around with these two girls until you finally decide... well, I don\'t know which one to choose... so I\'ll just choose them both!...This. This is how the anime ends. Sure. Poly relationships are fine, literally nothing wrong with them, but when the whole anime is about him trying to figure out which one to choose only to choose them both? Yeah... no.Also, I would just like to say that do the producers of this anime (and originally manga) expect anybody to actually be satisfied with it? Sure, a few odd people might be but seeing as this anime is probably centered towards girls, don\'t they know that fujoshis are very popular these days? Did they learn NOTHING at all from Yuri on Ice (which, mind you I\'ve never seen, but I do know how popular it is)? It might seem like I\'m just being bitter that I didn\'t get to see the ending I wanted but regardless of that, this anime is shit.Taking all of that off the plate, Koi to Uso is still a shit anime as the producers of it do not know how to make a proper romance anime. With a strangely fast-paced (but repetitive), cheesy as hell cliche love story, I think they\'ll find that the majority of viewers can\'t even stand to watch it (or at least I can\'t).If you like good anime, don\'t watch this.

Romance anime are not that highrated.THANK YOU FOR READING', ""Warning possible SpoilersEarlier this year we got Scum's Wish, which delved into the darker side of romance, however now it seems during the summer season we got another anime that delves into a darker aspect of romance, except this time it's a little bit different.Story (8/10)The story is set in a world where Japan assigns people together when they become 16 years old, for Yukari Nejima this is a bad thing since he loves someone else that is until he encountered his assigned wife.Now the best part about the story is how random and unexpected it is, because I was expecting another casual love triangle...to happen between Nejima, Misaki and Ririna, but that wasn't the case because over the course of the show each of the characters feelings change a lot, each of the characters always question whether the feelings their experiencing is true love or just a lie and what surprises me as well is the actions the characters took, I was expecting a lot of fights and arguments to break out yet the characters actually overcame the situation quite maturely and civilised which is usually an uncommon site.There was also quite a lot of drama and emotional moments between the characters, because of this and their likeable personalities it was really difficult who Nejima should have ended up with since each of the characters gave good reasons.However I will admit that the story did start lacking a little during the final episodes, the ending didn't help either although it's mixed for me because it was unexpected yet I feel like it was the cowardly route to have gone for, if there is a season 2 it would be interesting seeing how it would carry on this development.Characters (9/10)The main cast of characters were for once very likeable, it was very enjoyable watching them change throughout the show as they started experiencing new and stronger emotions.Yukari Nejima is the male MC, he is you're usual MC being the awkward and uncomfortable guy yet he can also be very honest, straightforward and selfless which probably helped him out along the way, it was interesting seeing how his love for Misaki get stronger while he also started developing feelings for Ririna too, this led him to a dilemma on who he wants to be with and which feelings are the correct ones to go for.Misaki Takasaki is the female MC who Nejima has loved for 5 years, despite being a popular and interactive girl she always has had her eyes on Nejima, however her strong feelings for Nejima have created conflict within her because she wishes that whoever is assigned to Nejima feels the way she does for him, but she creates a lie in order to protect Ririna so she doesn't get hurt, it was interesting seeing Misaki's feelings for Nejima become a battlefield inside of her on whether she should stay true to her feelings or not.Ririna Sanada is the female MC who is Nejima's assigned wife, even though Ririna is a Tsundere she is actually the one I would probably get along with the most, she does start of hitting Nejima a few times in her first episode (although the reasons are understandable), yet her character shifts tones a lot going from shy, awkward and a bit angry into an open, straightforward, innocent and cute person. This made her the most interesting character of the series because I thought I was going to end up hating her, but her change in feelings towards Nejima made the journey a lot more entertaining and enjoyable.Yuusuke Nisaka is Nejima's best friend, he also has a secret that he is also in love with Nejima, this made him another interesting piece to the story because he would be the one struggling the most, this is mainly due to the marriage system so his love for Nejima is forbidden well I think because the anime failed to explain this, hence why a season 2 should in some way concentrate on this since Nisaka had an interesting personality, he just wasn't used to his best effect.Art (8/10)The art was pretty nice including the character designs although it was kinda distracting, mainly due to the large round eyes they had which made them stand out a lot. It did remind of Orange and Your Lie in April a little because it gave the characters more visible features like lips, they aren't usually seen in a lot of anime's instead it's usually just a line.Sound (8/10)The op and ed were alright, not as good compared to Scum's Wish which had a much better op, no what makes Koi to Uso stand out was the soundtrack which fitted a lot of the scenes very nicely, yet there were some scenes where the soundtrack had a good beat going yet didn't match the events that were going on like the scene where Nejima and Ririna were talking calmly in a park and the soundtrack got really upbeat for some reason.Extras:The Romance was actually done very well, the change in everyone's feelings was the main reason I kept on this because I was really interested to see who would fall for who while also wanting to see who end up being the most hurt, true the outcome was much happier than I was expecting which was a bit of a let down, but it has made it a bit more intriguing because you wonder what's going to happen next.There was also bits and pieces of fanservice too although those moments where the characters kissed for once didn't feel sexy like it's for the viewers pleasure, instead it felt like the characters were being true to themselves.Enjoyment (8/10)Overall this was an enjoyable Romance, I was expecting another Scum's Wish and instead I got something a little more interesting, however there were some things that weren't expanded upon which is what I hope will be explored, if there is ever a season 2. to happen between Nejima, Misaki and Ririna, but that wasn't the case because over the course of the show each of the characters feelings change a lot, each of the characters always question whether the feelings their experiencing is true love or just a lie and what surprises me as well is the actions the characters took, I was expecting a lot of fights and arguments to break out yet the characters actually overcame the situation quite maturely and civilised which is usually an uncommon site.There was also quite a lot of drama and emotional moments between the characters, because of this and their likeable personalities it was really difficult who Nejima should have ended up with since each of the characters gave good reasons.However I will admit that the story did start lacking a little during the final episodes, the ending didn't help either although it's mixed for me because it was unexpected yet I feel like it was the cowardly route to have gone for, if there is a season 2 it would be interesting seeing how it would carry on this development.Characters (9/10)The main cast of characters were for once very likeable, it was very enjoyable watching them change throughout the show as they started experiencing new and stronger emotions.Yukari Nejima is the male MC, he is you're usual MC being the awkward and uncomfortable guy yet he can also be very honest, straightforward and selfless which probably helped him out along the way, it was interesting seeing how his love for Misaki get stronger while he also started developing feelings for Ririna too, this led him to a dilemma on who he wants to be with and which feelings are the correct ones to go for.Misaki Takasaki is the female MC who Nejima has loved for 5 years, despite being a popular and interactive girl she always has had her eyes on Nejima, however her strong feelings for Nejima have created conflict within her because she wishes that whoever is assigned to Nejima feels the way she does for him, but she creates a lie in order to protect Ririna so she doesn't get hurt, it was interesting seeing Misaki's feelings for Nejima become a battlefield inside of her on whether she should stay true to her feelings or not.Ririna Sanada is the female MC who is Nejima's assigned wife, even though Ririna is a Tsundere she is actually the one I would probably get along with the most, she does start of hitting Nejima a few times in her first episode (although the reasons are understandable), yet her character shifts tones a lot going from shy, awkward and a bit angry into an open, straightforward, innocent and cute person.

Everything was pretty good until the last episode. The story was interesting because something new happened every episode. The storyline at the start was very interesting along with the way their society was. The characters were decently interesting and the music was great. In first few episodes the genre changed from a love story to a drama to a harem. It was pretty confusing but it cleared up. The first halves of the episodes were normal, but the next half was always weird. It would end on a bad note just to be cleared...up later, or it would create more drama for the next episode. But, the last episode changed my opinion of all of this. It was the worst ending I have ever watched. I do not recommend this series. up later, or it would create more drama for the next episode.

I do not recommend this series.', ""SPOILERS!!!!So I actually just finished love and lies and I wanna be honest. I have noticed that a lot of people kind of dislike this anime. However, I am here to give a positive (for the most part) review. Okay I wanna start off saying that I really like the art style in this show. I think the characters are cute and enjoyable. Now, I do have one complaint. I really disliked how he loved both in the end. I really feel like he should have chosen one. Just felt like he played around with both of them. Despite this, I really couldn't choose between...the two girls. At first, the childhood crush is the obvious choice, but then you get to meet the assigned wife. I personally started to love her character the more the show went on. So, just like Neji, you find yourself conflicted between the two of them. Kinda smart kinda annoying. HOWEVER! it all comes down to how I enjoyed it, so I will give it a 8.  Let it be a reminder that you have you're own dislikes and likes. Just because some people dislike something, doesn't mean you shouldn't like it. Be respectful to others opinions <3 the two girls.

Be respectful to others opinions <3"", ""I'm not going to lie, I personally didn't enjoy this anime. From the first episode I was really interested and had high expectations, but the second half, for me, was much lower quality than the first. I haven't read the manga and I do not plan to.  [Minor Spoilers]The entire concept was flawed and looked over. I completely did not understand why refusing your assigned partner was such an issue. If the system was to combat low birth rates, why would they have an issue with a couple marrying if it wasn't the one they'd picked out if they were most likely going to...have children anyway? I could have overlooked this, but as it made the rest of the plot seem like unnecessary forced drama, it was hard to feel sympathy or relate towards the characters.For me, the characters were 2-dimensional and undeveloped. There was barely any character development throughout the entire show (except perhaps Ririna) which was frustrating as I could have related to the characters more if I understood them and their feelings. Everything felt a bit forced which was annoying because it could have been a better show if the characters weren't so dull.What Koi to Uso does do well, in my opinion, is sound and art. I understand there are mixed feelings about the art but I thought it fit the show and didn't look too bad for the scenes it was in. It wasn't a reason on its own to dislike or rate down the show.The sound was good too, I loved the opening and the background music. Some of the voice acting  was pretty good and all of it was bearable. I felt like the characters weren't badly cast.Overall, Koi to Uso isn't an anime I despise, but I just don't like it. Watching it isn't one of my deepest regrets, and it was, in a way, kind of entertaining. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but I wouldn't judge someone if they like it or want to watch it, because they're entitled to their own opinion.

The background story on how he had a feelings for her is really ridiculous.The animation is 3/10( i don't like big eyes and the character's design isn't that good)Plot is 5/10 - Plain average, not good but not also bad.Story is 3.5/10 very awful.Voice acting is 5/10 as well not bad but not good. I guess the animation affected the voice acting.So overall this show is a waste of time and if you want to kill time, this is the perfect show for you. "", ""There's a reason why people say the intro deserves a better anime.I couldn't even get through half of the series because the story, motives, and reactions fucking ooze of r//pe culture.Basically, the government assigns everyone a significant other. Our main character dude is in love with a girl, who, surprise, isn't the wife the government assigns him. He fell in love because she thanked him for giving her half of an eraser in, like, 1st grade. Because of that, he redirected his ENTIRE life just for the possibility to end up in the same high school as her, just to try to up his odds...of the government assigning her as his wife.Let me repeat that. He's in love with her because she thanked him for giving her half of an eraser. WHEN THEY WERE 6-7 YEARS OLD. And because she thanked him, he changes his entire fucking life just for the *chance* for the government to assign her as his wife.And because of course she does, she happens to be in love with him because of that exact moment, where he gave her half of an eraser. However, like a sane person would, she continues on with her life. That's until his birthday, where he confesses his love to her, and iirc, explains that his stalker-y actions existed. Somehow, she finds that romantic, and they kiss until government agents come to announce that his wife is someone else.Then he meets his government-assigned wife. He's fuckin unresponsive because he's upset that his stalking didn't lead to his crush being his wife, and his government-assigned wife is understandably upset about that.

He's in love with her because she thanked him for giving her half of an eraser. WHEN THEY WERE 6-7 YEARS OLD. And because she thanked him, he changes his entire fucking life just for the *chance* for the government to assign her as his wife.And because of course she does, she happens to be in love with him because of that exact moment, where he gave her half of an eraser. However, like a sane person would, she continues on with her life. That's until his birthday, where he confesses his love to her, and iirc, explains that his stalker-y actions existed. Somehow, she finds that romantic, and they kiss until government agents come to announce that his wife is someone else.Then he meets his government-assigned wife. He's fuckin unresponsive because he's upset that his stalking didn't lead to his crush being his wife, and his government-assigned wife is understandably upset about that. They go to another room, he explains how much of a fuckin creep he is, and government-assigned wife thinks that his behavior is romantic.Everyone treated him literally stalking her so that he can try to make the government assign her as his wife as normal and romantic.

One of the worst things I've watched in my almost 20 years of life."", ""I watched Koi to Uso (including OVA), also known as Love and Lies or Koi to Kuso. Here are my thoughts:Koi to Uso is about a group of highschool students in a world where marital partners are assigned by the government. Most of the story revolves around the MC's affections being divided between his government-assigned partner and the girl he naturally desires.My first impulse was to drop this, and for about half a year I did, but I ended up coming back to it out of curiosity. What I discovered is that Koi to Uso is an utterly ridiculous show but it has enough redeeming...qualities to be enjoyable. For the record, I have never read the manga.The story of this literally feels like a 13-year-old's creative writing assignment. Everything has this juvenile logic to it; the story demands a lot of suspension of disbelief. I really can't overstate how cheesy and pulp-fiction-like the story is. Even by highschool romance anime standards, this show is unbelievably corny and ridiculous. Forgive my use of youthful lingo, but this show is another level of 'cringe'. The secondhand embarrassment I felt watching this was extreme. A lot of the character interaction felt unnatural and it was kind of eerie. The way this show treats romance in general feels quite immature and juvenile, although it is somewhat endearing. It's possible that my perception of this is clouded by cultural differences in the courtship process.The male MC is awful and has zero personality besides being a spineless, indecisive, clueless idiot, like most highschool anime protagonists. However, both the main female love interests have unique personalities and surprisingly a lot of depth to their character that unfolds throughout the show. They are more-thoughtful characters than the typical female love interests of a male-oriented hetero romance (a pretty low bar to overcome).The thing is, pretty much all the flaws I've discussed above are storywriting issues. If you can look beyond that, Koi to Uso is actually a fairly well-directed show. It does a decent job of setting up romantic tension, and overall kept things dramatic and interesting. The character interaction, although written in an absurd manner, is sometimes surprisingly well executed. There are some romantic scenes in here that absolutely knock it out of the park with great script, music and cinematography. I know I'm showing contempt for this show in this review, but do not be mistaken: there are some scenes in here that made me gush they were so intimate. Furthermore, Koi to Uso is unique – it fully embraces its premise and explores the concept quite thoroughly. I also appreciated the absence of comedy; this show delivers its corniness with a totally straight face and I appreciated that.As for visuals, I liked the character designs, including the eyes; the characters' eyes are huge and bug-like even by anime standards. I liked the characters' faces but they're definitely a little uncanny and other people may find them off-putting. The character animation is decent for a non-action anime, better than I expected at least. The facial expressions are well animated. During some scenes the cinematography is more sophisticated than I'd expect from a typical highschool romance show. Overall the production value is a notch above your average anime, although the manifestations of this are subtle.The soundtrack is surprisingly good and felt quite modern and well produced – definitely a much better OST than your average anime. The background music elevated a lot of scenes and enhanced the show considerably. Conversely, I found the voice acting mediocre and none of the VAs impressed me.I liked that the existence of sex was acknowledged in this. As opposed to so many other highschool romance shows where handholding might as well be our species' means of reproduction. This show is fairly 'sex positive' so to speak, which is somewhat rare for romance anime and might be a desirable feature for some viewers.My overall rating: 6/10Koi to Uso is SO BAD it's KINDA GOOD. The writing of this is comically moronic, but the execution is good enough to salvage this fanfic-tier story. The show is fairly well directed and decently produced. If you're prepared to endure a weapons-grade level of cringe, this anime is actually pretty enjoyable and entertaining. State of mind is hugely important though – you really need to embrace the corniness of this to enjoy it. There are some surprisingly romantic scenes in here if you have an open-minded attitude. Koi to Uso exceeded my low expectations.If you're just looking for some ridiculously campy telenovela-tier romance, then this anime is a good candidate for that. It literally feels like some teenager's fanfiction randomly got an anime adaptation. I want to reiterate again how juvenile this show is: I think it would be hard for someone older than 14 to take it seriously. That's part of its charm though – it's so silly that it's fun. For fans of highschool romance, I think this anime is worth checking out, especially if you like this kind of thing served over-the-top ultra cheesy. This is definitely not an anime for everyone, but there is a specific kind of audience that would enjoy it. I'm glad that I gave it a second chance and didn't discard it based on its poor first impression. Also, if you're a drinker, this show is best enjoyed with a little booze to make you more receptive to the cringiness and cheesy romance.If you are weirdly fixated on the idea of the government assigning you a spouse (I've actually seen this seriously discussed many times on the internet), then you might be interested in this show – it explores that topic quite thoroughly. Also, in case you hadn't inferred already, I think a female viewer is more likely to enjoy this due to the focus on marriage and relationship dynamics.If you like ultra-cheesy highschool romance, you should give Koi to Uso a chance. qualities to be enjoyable.

That is not what I got. The ending was a cop out that i normally see in bad harem anime's. The characters were stale all except for the pretty boy who, I think, should have had more screen time because he was the most realistic character in the show. The OP and ED were very enjoyable and I will...listen to them in my off time. The OST was nothing special but wasn't noticeably bad. The premise for the show was actually very interesting and I thought it was a realistic setting for Japan. However, the event that takes place are very shallow and cliche in content. As I was watching I kept coming up with better scenarios than what the show had in store. There were some conflicts that I thought would make this show go from a overall 5 to a 7. Sadly that is not what I got and I personally feel robbed of my time. listen to them in my off time. The OST was nothing special but wasn't noticeably bad.

The government chooses a person\'s partner when they reach the age of 16.In the first two episodes, Koi to Uso does a good job of conveying the emotions that come from teenagers living in a world that is quite different from ours, at first glance. The teenagers don\'t like the fact that their partner will get chosen for them, so they declare that they\'ll never get married, which is a rather accurate representation of a teenager\'s feelings before they fall in love; representing their fear and denial of getting married.The premise is very similar to a...modern-day Romeo & Juliet, and like I stated, it does a good job of conveying that ""forbidden love"" in the first two episodes, but then it falls apart right after and turns into a generic romcom.If a partner-choosing system like that was to be forced on people in the real world, everyone would lose their shit. It\'s an oppressive system that manipulates people and ""encourages"" them to have children just so the birth rate doesn\'t decline.And instead of showing that, the series does the complete opposite and tries to imply that this system is almost 100% accurate with its results, and most pairs are happy with their partner. It\'s very unbelievable as we\'re barely told anything about this system.With this system set by the government, this series had a lot of potential in exploring how different this world is compared to ours, how people act differently, live differently, feel differently, deal with certain situations differently. Hell, this premise is even perfect to explore homosexual relationships, but the most this show does is only give implications and it never delves deeper into it, almost like it\'s too afraid to stray away from its generic romcom direction.I would go more into this, but this review is long already.

Never mind that. Koi to Uso isn’t that great of an anime it’s not even good. The only reason I rated it the way I did is because of my personal enjoyment. The concept yes, is original but when you break it down it’s nothing new. We all know arranged marriage was a common practice in Japan, rich families want their daughters married to someone of similar background or social status. Like you wouldn’t marry your child to a random delinquent when your line is of nobility or to the daughter of a farmer when you are raising your son...to be a business owner. Yes, that’s what it means to have your marriage arranged for you. You do NOT get to decide for yourself. All the show did was bring the idea into a different era: to the future of perhaps 2067. Now, like the tradition mentioned before. Our oh-why-so-bland main character has a wife appointed to him by the government (ikr. How great would that be?) but the problem is he already has a girl that likes him. Seriously?? How come stuff like that never happens to me? Only in Japanese anime do you get a childhood friend who has a crush on you. By Default.The story leaves you a feeling of incompletion and the ending is anime original which means FILLER. Many questions are not answered by the end of its 12 episode run. Below are my dissatisfaction with this show:1.\tMisaki (one of the two main girls) and one of the casts spite each other WHY?2.\tThe said character hardly gets any focus; he has a billion times more depth than mc3.\tDistribution of screentime is awfully uneven between Misaki and Ririna4.\tRirina can be absent and the story would be a lot more family friendly5.\tRirina feels like anime add-on6.\tThe society has accepted sex as everyday life: the age of harlots and horn dogsNot that I hate the character Ririna in any way I actually like her a lot and she makes an elite waifu. It’s just that the anime doesn’t do her justice. The way this show uses her is unnecessary, like she is only there to cause tension between the love of mc and Misaki. Note that Ririna is in no way poorly written or one dimensional character. The anime is bad but I did still enjoy it.  One thing that saved it is no excessive fanservice. The mc, for once didn’t “accidentally” run into a girl who’s in the middle of changing. The characters are likable (minus MC) and the concept is somewhat new although in the end it turns out no different from your everyday love story or even harem tuned down. If anyone is to be blamed for Koi to Uso not getting a score of 8.77, it is no doubt the fault of the studio that adapted it.BELOW IS MY FIRST REVIEW IF YOU CARE TO READ______________________________________________________________Koi to Uso is a love story about a boy and a girl’s school life.

And what\'s good about it is the system actually works for the people of Japan. And as the story progress, you will feel that these hand-picked partners by the government really are best suited or really is compatible with their counterpart. My only problem on this was, I hope you can still choose whether to accept or refuse your assigned partner. :)Art:...8- On my limited sense of art, I think Koi to Uso have a great art except those big round eyes. I simply can\'t ignore how Takasaki, Misaki\'s eyes looks kinda creepy sometimes. Though those big round eyes matches Ririna\'s character perfectly.I also love the color of their eyes and lights in background :)Sound: 8- The voice actors are great and I love the OP and ED. I wish they release the full song of the ED so I can add it on my phone\'s playlist..T_TCharacters: 9- I think this is where the show excels, the characters. The characters feel very human to me, being selfish or someone who tend to follow their heart even if its kind of wrong. I\'ll try to highlight each characters :)Nisaka, Yuusuke - I believe his the only characters who thinks rationally in the 4 main characters. His character is like a reality check to the other characters that life is not a fairy tale.Nejima, Yukari - Well, I think Yukari is just your typical goody old shoes MC in love triangles. He kind of bland too me but he has his own shine from time to time. And he can be a relatable, which is good for Male audiences since you can put yourself in his shoes. If you can put yourself in his shoes, you\'ll gonna feel the struggle in choosing the best girl. Like myself, I\'m struggling in choosing between Ririna and Misaki, they are both great girls for me so like Nejima, I can\'t choose one..HAHAHAHATakasaki, Misaki - Nothing to say here except I love ""PLOT""..HAHAHABut kidding aside, Misaki is a gorgeous character, I like her face (except the eyes sometimes), I like her body proportions (LOL) and I love also her character. She\'s a typical shoujo character and she\'s like a DERE-DERE girl (who wouldn\'t like a dere-dere GF? hahaha). Her character shines in her struggle choosing between her happiness and someone else. She\'s also the kind of character you can fall in love with. <3Sanada, Ririna - She\'s kind of a surprise character for me. At first I didn\'t like her that much coz I\'m not a lolicon and Misaki is so hot compared to her..LOLThough I\'m starting to fall for Ririna because of her character. She\'s mature (though she\'s younger) and she\'s someone who thinks of others happiness first than herself. You will definitely fall in love with her through her development as a character. And that\'s why I\'m so torn between her and Misaki..XDEnjoyment: 9- What is there to not enjoy, every episode makes you fall in love and feel despair. And that is good for a romance and drama anime. From episode 1 to current, your heart will experience a roller-coaster ride of emotions and be torn between the two best girls. You can really feel the struggles the characters had to fight in search of the meaning of love. :)Overall: 8 (Might changed depending on the ending..hahaha)- Overall, this show has its faults. Like how can you just fall in love because of one simple eraser? Even I find it unreasonable but who are we to judge? It might also be possible that their love developed through time and just started because of that simple eraser. But what is important here is that you can feel the characters emotions and love for one another.I want to recommend watching this anime to anyone who likes romance and drama. Really, I even recommend it to my girlfriend and I hope she won\'t get jealous coz I\'m fanboying over Misaki and Ririna..AHAHA 8- On my limited sense of art, I think Koi to Uso have a great art except those big round eyes. I simply can\'t ignore how Takasaki, Misaki\'s eyes looks kinda creepy sometimes. Though those big round eyes matches Ririna\'s character perfectly.I also love the color of their eyes and lights in background :)Sound: 8- The voice actors are great and I love the OP and ED. I wish they release the full song of the ED so I can add it on my phone\'s playlist..T_TCharacters: 9- I think this is where the show excels, the characters. The characters feel very human to me, being selfish or someone who tend to follow their heart even if its kind of wrong. I\'ll try to highlight each characters :)Nisaka, Yuusuke - I believe his the only characters who thinks rationally in the 4 main characters. His character is like a reality check to the other characters that life is not a fairy tale.Nejima, Yukari - Well, I think Yukari is just your typical goody old shoes MC in love triangles. He kind of bland too me but he has his own shine from time to time. And he can be a relatable, which is good for Male audiences since you can put yourself in his shoes. If you can put yourself in his shoes, you\'ll gonna feel the struggle in choosing the best girl. Like myself, I\'m struggling in choosing between Ririna and Misaki, they are both great girls for me so like Nejima, I can\'t choose one..HAHAHAHATakasaki, Misaki - Nothing to say here except I love ""PLOT""..HAHAHABut kidding aside, Misaki is a gorgeous character, I like her face (except the eyes sometimes), I like her body proportions (LOL) and I love also her character. She\'s a typical shoujo character and she\'s like a DERE-DERE girl (who wouldn\'t like a dere-dere GF? hahaha). Her character shines in her struggle choosing between her happiness and someone else.

The main character Yukari is a very shy boy who just wants to be in love with a girl he\'s liked since fifth grade however because of the government laws...to increase birthrates he ends up being assigned to get married to a different girl. The overall premise was interesting and I was curious to see who he would up with in the end. Sadly the series doesn\'t outright show or tell you exactly who he ends up with and I probably shouldn\'t say more so I won\'t spoil anything.Even though this series is classified as a drama, romance, school anime its also a harem, but not a generic one. One of the third characters that likes him doesn\'t get as much screen time as I wanted them too. I won\'t spoil who the third person is, but I honestly shipped them more than the two main girls in this series.Misaki\'s character was endearing, but I wish there was more to her character than just her liking Yukari and wanted him to happy. I felt the series focused too much on forcing relationships and kissing than it did on developing the characters one on one and giving them more reasons to like each other. Then there\'s Ririna who comes across as a bit of a tsundere at first until her feelings and emotions start to open up more. They also threw in random awkward fanservice between her and Yukari for some reason towards the beginning of the series. Then they make Misaki and Ririna like each other a lot right off the bat as friends. A part of me was like ""JUST HAVE A THREESOME OR SOMETHING."" (It did hint to that towards the end) ;)The big eye character designs might be off putting to some people which is understandable. Stuff like doesn\'t really bother me though. I actually like the art, but I\'ve definitely seen much better and all I really remember from the soundtrack is the opening and ending songs and to be honest they were both good.The drama aspect might feel forced although I found enjoyment out of it at times.

Of course premise and plot related stuff are different. But anyways, this started strongly with establishment of the theme, relationship of the main characters and conflict. They succeeded bringing up the emotions the characters went through and what relations they had. You really knew what they felt when conflict stroke. Until the first half everything went good but then things got way too complicated and there was this on again off...again things going. And until the end everything just wasn't what I expected. This may have to have something to do with that they left it open.Now the premise, so there is this government enforced marriage coupling program. I'd say it's like Minority report of marriages. Algorithms pick up from large number of data your future life partner and you are basically stuck and screwed if it messes up. It seems that this system have more than once given false matches and there is brief mentions about. Of course like in Minority report things don't go public. There is this girl whose dad? created the program and is trying to say that it made a mistake but the whole thing is swept away very shortly. An then never addressed again. What happened? This would have made nice Minority report style twist. Well it may have not suited for the style. It still kept bothering that it didn't amount to anything.Well as a romance anime the forbidden love and how it affected and complicated main characters  and his assigned wife's life is portrayed well. There is definitely a conflict within the main character when he is trying to be his wife but his true feelings for his GF keep coming up. This conflict is the premise and things get even more complicated when main char. and his wise actually start loving each other and his wife tries to get his husband with the GF.In the end everything gets together and conflict is solved and everybody lives happily ever after. Even though I'm harem ending supporter I would have preferred a sad bitter sweet ending with him choosing one of them. The assigned wife would have been more suitable for this anime. But then again if they would have made the Minority report thing it would have made the fugitives that are trying to over throne the system and corrupt government that runs the whole sha bang... But that's just me.Also you really really shouldn't think too deeply into this law, there is so many flaws and things that make it so stupid, super illegal and malfunctioning.

For the sake of explaining the whole plot shortly, I’m writing this. You may or may not agree, but here are my thoughts, anyway.With the simple informations given...to us through the synopsis, we can see that the story has real potential, and it does, but it doesn’t seem to be handled pretty well. At the start, there are a lot of ambiguous points that concern the characters, and as the first episodes go by, the knot seems to get tighter, and you demand more information to understand the whole thing, but many main points don’t get explained later on, and basically there’s no character development, it just gets messier, and you enter this maze of illogical actions (not in a good, mindful-ish way). But hey, things might get fixed in the last episode, right? I have great news for you: no.So, if you’re into psychological anime with a good plot, and story development, this might not be for you.The ending put the anime on fire, it seems to make the situation problematic in so many ways, and the thing is that it already was since the beginning, so imagine it not getting fixed at all.But are 16 years old ready for any kind of commitment? They are so unsure about so many things, how can a system be? The main character doesn’t have much of a personality to oppose the system or to choose someone, which makes pretty much at this point the story meaningless. Ririna was somehow interesting, but no further informations are given about her, it seems that she’s only there to ship Nejima and Misaki, and anyway she goes with the flow, no matter what situation she finds herself in.Finally, the story = much disappointment, such wow. to us through the synopsis, we can see that the story has real potential, and it does, but it doesn’t seem to be handled pretty well.

Ririna was somehow interesting, but no further informations are given about her, it seems that she’s only there to ship Nejima and Misaki, and anyway she goes with the flow, no matter what situation she finds herself in.Finally, the story = much disappointment, such wow.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Koi to Uso is an anime that asks an age-old question: “This or that?”Such a question has been asked by people, of people for a millennium. Presented with two choices, someone must select either-or to proceed. It may be as simple as choosing which piece of clothing to purchase at the mall. It may cause more thinking when it involves which vacation spot to go to over the summer. And it may be completely life altering as a specific college is selected to attend.No matter the chosen option, the outcome changes. For Koi to Uso,...that question pertains not to jackets, beaches, or reputations but rather marriage. And the answer it comes to is ultimately disappointing.STORYWhen it comes to love, many people believe in the concept of “the one.” A person who, by an unbelievable miracle, completes him or her like nobody else ever could. Whether such a sentiment makes sense matters not, for it isn’t so much about the miracle as it is about people finally finding their better half. Within the story of Koi to Uso, such a belief is unnecessary – because it’s now a reality.Government mandates, based off scientific evidence and extrapolation, discern for the masses their “one” to such a high degree of accuracy that compatibility is practically guaranteed. Already, and as the anime showcases, this intriguing premise gets the audience pondering about the truth behind love itself.Be it by notice or by nature, the events tackled within the anime prove that love isn’t so simple. Circumstances, ideas, emotions, upbringings. These facets and more drive someone’s feelings on both an inherent plane and a personal level. To the point that love, in Koi to Uso’s eyes, must mean more than just a reactionary feeling based on a single encounter.As it pits programmed fate against random destiny, the anime introduces different setups for its narrative that, while not groundbreaking, give it opportunities to further its thematic presence. For example, the Romeo and Juliet play, while perhaps an overused staple of the rom-com high-school genre, fits snuggly within the show’s discussion on forced feelings given the content of that famous Shakespeare work. Likewise, the camping trip, the sex lecture, and the wedding bring into the fold interpersonal drama, heightened hormones, and vital commitments (respectively) which once again follow the show’s intentions.However, Koi to Uso arguably fails to explore its premise to an adequate extent, glossing over potential problems and obvious cues in favor of keeping its focus on just Neji and his singular dilemma.Take the “penalty” for foregoing the genetic system. The anime often alludes to this threat, but it doesn’t mean much when it isn’t demonstrated in a real-world (their world) example. There’s also Nisaka’s case of homosexuality. Despite his own orientation, the show does not investigate how the government handles those who are attracted to the same sex, a trait which inherently goes against the “birth-rate boosting” ideology of the system. The show rarely even takes the time to highlight other couples or the system itself in action for comparative and contrasting purposes, turning the idea into a detail that the audience must trust and accept without remorse.Playing devil’s advocate, the premise here exists only to get the ball rolling and not much else. After all, expanding the scope of the plot beyond Neji, Misaki, Ririna, and Nisaka’s bubble wouldn’t necessarily serve their dramatic sequences. An acceptable defense, but this direction means that that bubble better be airtight. Unfortunately, it contains a few holes that keep it from maintaining a sound structure.One of these bigger holes takes the form of characters popping in out of nowhere. Yajima, the government man overseeing Neji’s situation, appears unannounced many a time, like at the school or at the cat playhouse. And Nisaka’s father has one of the most glaring “Okay, now where did he come from?” moments the medium has ever seen.Another major hole pops up as frustrating circular dialogue. Characters like Igarashi and Misaki seem as if they are talking in earnest to Neji and others – only for them to take it all back afterwards. Lines such as “forget everything just said” forces this problem to the forefront.And, at its core, the back and forth between Misaki and Ririna represents another hole for Koi to Uso to overcome. But this hole is both a blessing and a curse. It’s a blessing because the anime demonstrates well enough why either side deserves to win in the first place based off their separate-yet-similar reasons regarding love and its necessity in their lives. Plus, it’s the whole point of the show. Without this struggle, no story would exist, and it would therefore not have the chance to think about the scientific and personal implications of love.Yet it’s a curse because, by the halfway point, it becomes painfully obvious that the show will not forego the status quo. Instead, it keeps the narrative in a tug-of-war match that only induces frustration and tiredness the further it goes. This lack of progression means less insight and more of the same drama revisited in a stale fashion.Must one or the other be selected? Perhaps not. But when Koi to Uso tries very hard to make it seem so throughout the season, and then fails to resolve much (if anything) come the end, it somewhat defeats the purpose of having to make a choice between the two in the first place.Overall, this anime has interesting ideas about love and creates some nice setups for its story to talk about the concept. Sadly, it restricts the premise, it upholds too many writing problems, and it lacks a definitive answer to the question it posits. So, altogether, this narrative is by no means “the one” in this context.ART & ANIMATIONAmong the anime’s key traits, Koi to Uso’s artistry arguably ranks in the middle of the lot.To its credit, the designs of the characters at least stand out in some regard. Yes, Neji’s short brown hair and unassuming looks unfortunately paint him as a rather bland person. But Misaki, Ririna, and Nisaka do not succumb to this same problem.Instead, the love interests have a few details to call their own. Neji (and the audience) lose themselves in the girls’ large (almost too large) eyes as they look on with affection. Flushed fingers and long lashes increase their prettiness without calling attention to themselves as well. Individually, Misaki’s medium-length hair and generous proportions increase her physical attractiveness, and Ririna’s refined beauty evokes for her a cute, docile aura. As for Nisaka, his purple motif gives him a cool appearance, and his thinner eyes incite his standoffish personality well enough.Besides the nice character designs, the lighting within the show also has a small foothold. Vibrant nighttime scenes with glowing fireflies. A sunset cascading into a classroom as a gentle breeze shifts the curtains around. Shadowing techniques as they start to get a bit frisky. While not incredible, Koi to Uso likes to play around with the lighting in its scenes when and where it can.Speaking of “frisky,” the anime also isn’t afraid to showcase its distinct advances, highlighting the passions of the characters therein with kissing and caressing aplenty. Some of the slight ecchi moments perhaps do not belong in this drama, though. They could be chalked up to a meta aspect of the visuals that reflects their sexual ignorance, but that seems like a stretch. At any rate, the show includes a few comedic styles and backgrounds on occasion to change up its usually serious self.Otherwise, the anime is very straightforward in its presentation. The setting and the direction do not do a whole lot to engage the audience, and the actual animation neither improves nor does anything too interesting. Worse still, artistic errors sometimes creep their way in. For instance, in episode eight, Nisaka’s mouth continues moving as he walks down some steps despite not speaking anymore.Again, though, the designs, the various lighting techniques, and the attempts at varied styles prevent the visuals from falling out of favor. Meaning, the show delivers a passable artistic direction for this love-filled story.CHARACTERSThe characters of Koi to Uso must contend with those occasionally tumultuous, often invigorating feelings of love. Neji, Misaki, Ririna, and Nisaka go about it in their own way, but they also have clear parallels which tie them together.Most notably, these characters are quite naïve when it comes to love in and of itself. Indeed, they often think about and ask a philosophical question: “What is love?” To them, the “powers that be” have controlled their outlooks and their thoughts on the subject their entire lives. So, it makes valid sense that exchanging an eraser, listening in earnest, or sticking up for someone sparks those skip-a-beat feelings that they do not yet fully comprehend.Their naivety also explains their reactionary behavior, for each of them responds to love in a similar yet distinct manner. Neji caves to the thoughts and actions which so easily influence him. Misaki runs away from and lies about her feelings. Ririna romanticizes romance with a starry-eyed expression. And Nisaka goes wholly on the defensive, remaining aloof in his mindset. Without a doubt, love plays a big part in their personalities.That’s them as a grouping. On their own, these four teenagers not only have different places within Koi to Uso but also have different purposes as well. The two most interesting cast members that fit this description are the ones who get along the least: Ririna and Nisaka.While Ririna’s backstory as a sickly child receives the bare minimum of attention, it accounts for much of her persona. Awkward social behavior, lack of companionship, idolization of romance. Her starting point within this series may in fact be the lowest among the cast simply because she, unlike everyone else, finds love only now and therefore understands the least about it.Thus, her bonds with Neji and the others grant her better relationships and allow her to discover a more realistic view on love. She befriends Misaki and a fellow classmate at her school as she opens up to them, and she learns from Neji and Misaki in equal parts that her feelings equate to a tangible, meaningful existence. So, seeing her evolve from a lonely girl to a mature lady becomes a high point of this series.Nisaka doesn’t evolve as much as Ririna, but he plays an important role within Koi to Uso: maintaining a rational perspective. He often lets Neji bounce ideas off him so that he can in turn dish out his calm advice on the situation. Advice that comes directly from his heart. He can be a bit too tactless, but he has care within him, like when he is willing to put up with the school festival if it would mean making his best friend happy. Either way, when Neji caves, Misaki lies, and Ririna romanticizes, Nisaka keeps that cool of his (save for when his family rolls around), forming a nice contrast in the grounded stance he takes as compared to those three.Unfortunately, Koi to Uso ignores Nisaka’s character to some extent. His interactions with Misaki and Ririna are few and far between despite their collective, interconnected circumstances with and towards Neji. Which is doubly odd for Misaki since his (heavily implied) feud of sorts with her doesn’t mean much or go anywhere meaningful.As for Misaki and Neji, they fall further behind. The entire season, Misaki lies about how she truly feels, fitting her character well enough and imposing a strangeness within the dynamics. She even goes so far as to “betray” her friendship with Ririna in that she at one point secretly wishes for her to fail. As she sadly says, “It’s a cruel thing…loving someone.”Yet the anime never reveals the true motive behind why she cannot follow her heart’s desires. Some guesses can be made (e.g., she’s lying about being matched with someone else already, she has a terminal illness that literally prevents a long-term relationship). However, without concrete proof, they’re nothing more than guesses. Her friend Igarashi appears later in the season to deliver extra information about Misaki, but most of the audience already knew or at least could infer these repeated details. As such, she certainly remains shrouded in mystery but likewise stays in a static state with little to no progression.Similarly, Neji is the plain, main protagonist whose main hobby includes knowledge about burial mounds. So, naturally, he’s quite unintriguing, acting more as the vessel for this tale rather than a worthwhile person within it. Not to mention his simultaneous passivity and forwardness. Contradictory behavior for sure, yet it oddly works. In a writing sense, it reflects the tough decision he has before him: choosing between Misaki or Ririna as his bride-to-be.To flesh out Neji’s character, Koi to Uso juxtaposes him with Yajima. Surprisingly, this government dude had a personal love (implied to be his red-haired work partner) that he did not pursue, posing as a what-if for the impressionable guy. This tangent leads to a dead-end, though, because Yajima’s involvement and impact feels more like an aside rather than a point of purpose.Despite Misaki and Neji not having the greatest substance within this story, they stay true to themselves and have their tiny moments here and there. Plus, Nisaka’s role, Ririna’s arc, and the parallels present demonstrate that they all contend with their feelings on love no matter what.MUSIC & SOUNDWhen it comes to the music and the sound within Koi to Uso, its audio decisions reach a standstill of sorts.On the helpful side, its opening track provides a neat start. The OP, aptly titled “Kanashii Ureshii” due to its catchy lyrical content, begins each episode with a few peppy xylophone notes and a drum beat. However, the funky bass line, the harmonizing vocals, and the clapping interlude create in the song a passion and a somberness that reflects the emotions present throughout the season. Arguably, the dance-like, almost bubbly tone falls outside the scope of this dramatic tale insofar as the composition seems more aligned with a groovier structure rather than a direct appeal. Nevertheless, the OP has the musical chops to take a leading spot within the show.The original soundtrack also helps Koi to Uso with its atmospheric approach. Grating sounds, jittery piano keys, reverberating guitar strings, grander movements. These ambient layers coat the show in unease but still maintain a sense of structure throughout. Such structured uneasiness coincides with that ever-present choice that nags at Neji’s mind. Even the tracks that focus on lighter instrumentation for the not-so-serious moments involve a lot of singular, disparate notes too, keeping the anime consistent in its music while also demonstrating its range.After the OP and the OST, the music slowly skirts away from helpfulness and towards hindering. Listening to the ending track “Can’t You Say”, it ditches the groove of the OP for that direct appeal in a hip-hop love song. The snapping, the chimes, the female singers, the melodic structure. Everything screams romantic and emotional, complementing the anime’s own direction. However, despite picking up in the second half of the song and intermixing both Japanese and English lyrics for more dynamism, the ED doesn’t do enough to leave a lasting impression in its beat, its vocals, or its delivery to reach a similar set of heights as its counterpart.Voice acting likewise reaches the same conclusion. Each performance works as is but fails to capitalize on a lot of scenes with any notable moments. At the very least, Kana Hanazawa as Misaki and Yui Makino as Ririna bring along innocence, Ryota Osaka as Neji fumbles ahead with nervousness, and Shinnosuke Tachibana keeps his cool for sure.These VA performances mark for an average outing, meaning they’re neither too positive nor too negative in execution. In fact, the only real negative in the sound design stems from the infrequent mixing issues. For, while that OST is nice and has its uses during the season, it sometimes overbears the characters as they talk. Again, not that it always happens, but the loudness is noticeable during select scenes.Pointing out the loud music may be overly nitpicky anyway, for the OP and the OST help Koi to Uso in a positive sense regardless. And the ED and the VA performances, while not standout in their inclusion, do not interfere with this project. In total then, and much like the art and the animation, the audio elements rank somewhere in the middle.ENJOYMENTThe fact that I wouldn’t mind if either Misaki or Ririna won must say something about me, about the anime accomplishing its goals, or both.They’re kindhearted and sincere, each wanting a relationship with Neji while also dealing with their own situations and even looking out for the other in some fashion. Truth be told, I still like Misaki more than Ririna and believe Misaki to be the better of the two. Yes, she lies a lot, but my heart tells me that her feelings for Neji (and his for her) hold a higher value than those of Ririna’s if only because they derive from a personal place all their own as opposed to a by-the-books matchup.Again, though, I would be perfectly okay with a polygamous ending despite such an outcome defeating the purpose of the show’s thematic presence. For Ririna’s emotions, while a result of government meddling, still blossom from the real bond that she shares with Neji. In simpler terms, I just want those three to live happily ever after together because they deserve it. So, I’m rooting for the harem.That said, I feel sad for Nisaka. Not that he was ever teased or belittled about his feelings or his personality (because he is known as the hottest, coolest guy in school), but the anime almost never gave him a chance to begin with. Neji clearly has no romantic interest in him, so he was doomed before the story started. Even the scene where the girls rush his changing area when nobody did the same to Misaki minutes earlier didn’t sit right with me in its blatant double-standard portrayal.Aside from the mistreatment of Nisaka, I didn’t dislike the anime. I could do without Neji since he wasn’t the best protagonist, but the passionate moments with Misaki and the heartfelt talks with Ririna kept me entertained. The smaller comedy sketches had me slightly chuckling, too. However, without a proper conclusion on any front, I’m left unsatisfied with this incomplete tale.Koi to Uso leaves much to be desired. It does have several strong traits: its ideas, some of the details in the artistry, a couple of its cast members, pieces of the music. But too many others are decidedly weak: a slew of narrative problems, a boring artistic direction, lame character involvement, average audio design. Between “this” or “that”, this project chose poorly.SUMMARYStory: Bad, despite having themes targeting the true roots of love and using worthwhile setups for its various events, the unexplored premise, the weak narrative direction, and the inherent lack of progress prevent this tale from reaching a meaningful placeArt & Animation: Fine, nice character designs and appreciated lighting techniques offset the rather straightforward artistryCharacters: Fine, parallels between the cast strengthen their foundations, Ririna goes through a solid arc, Nisaka is an interesting player who is ignored, Misaki remains too static, and Neji needs more to himMusic & Sound: Fine, a neat OP and an ambient OST help more so than the direct ED, the okay VA performances, and the infrequent loudness in the audioEnjoyment: Fine, although Misaki is better than Ririna, a polygamous outcome is highly acceptable for maximum romance, but Nisaka’s mistreatment and an unfinished answer is not welcomeFinal Score: 4/10 that question pertains not to jackets, beaches, or reputations but rather marriage. And the answer it comes to is ultimately disappointing.STORYWhen it comes to love, many people believe in the concept of “the one.” A person who, by an unbelievable miracle, completes him or her like nobody else ever could. Whether such a sentiment makes sense matters not, for it isn’t so much about the miracle as it is about people finally finding their better half. Within the story of Koi to Uso, such a belief is unnecessary – because it’s now a reality.Government mandates, based off scientific evidence and extrapolation, discern for the masses their “one” to such a high degree of accuracy that compatibility is practically guaranteed. Already, and as the anime showcases, this intriguing premise gets the audience pondering about the truth behind love itself.Be it by notice or by nature, the events tackled within the anime prove that love isn’t so simple. Circumstances, ideas, emotions, upbringings. These facets and more drive someone’s feelings on both an inherent plane and a personal level. To the point that love, in Koi to Uso’s eyes, must mean more than just a reactionary feeling based on a single encounter.As it pits programmed fate against random destiny, the anime introduces different setups for its narrative that, while not groundbreaking, give it opportunities to further its thematic presence. For example, the Romeo and Juliet play, while perhaps an overused staple of the rom-com high-school genre, fits snuggly within the show’s discussion on forced feelings given the content of that famous Shakespeare work. Likewise, the camping trip, the sex lecture, and the wedding bring into the fold interpersonal drama, heightened hormones, and vital commitments (respectively) which once again follow the show’s intentions.However, Koi to Uso arguably fails to explore its premise to an adequate extent, glossing over potential problems and obvious cues in favor of keeping its focus on just Neji and his singular dilemma.Take the “penalty” for foregoing the genetic system. The anime often alludes to this threat, but it doesn’t mean much when it isn’t demonstrated in a real-world (their world) example. There’s also Nisaka’s case of homosexuality. Despite his own orientation, the show does not investigate how the government handles those who are attracted to the same sex, a trait which inherently goes against the “birth-rate boosting” ideology of the system. The show rarely even takes the time to highlight other couples or the system itself in action for comparative and contrasting purposes, turning the idea into a detail that the audience must trust and accept without remorse.Playing devil’s advocate, the premise here exists only to get the ball rolling and not much else. After all, expanding the scope of the plot beyond Neji, Misaki, Ririna, and Nisaka’s bubble wouldn’t necessarily serve their dramatic sequences. An acceptable defense, but this direction means that that bubble better be airtight. Unfortunately, it contains a few holes that keep it from maintaining a sound structure.One of these bigger holes takes the form of characters popping in out of nowhere. Yajima, the government man overseeing Neji’s situation, appears unannounced many a time, like at the school or at the cat playhouse. And Nisaka’s father has one of the most glaring “Okay, now where did he come from?” moments the medium has ever seen.Another major hole pops up as frustrating circular dialogue. Characters like Igarashi and Misaki seem as if they are talking in earnest to Neji and others – only for them to take it all back afterwards. Lines such as “forget everything just said” forces this problem to the forefront.And, at its core, the back and forth between Misaki and Ririna represents another hole for Koi to Uso to overcome. But this hole is both a blessing and a curse. It’s a blessing because the anime demonstrates well enough why either side deserves to win in the first place based off their separate-yet-similar reasons regarding love and its necessity in their lives. Plus, it’s the whole point of the show. Without this struggle, no story would exist, and it would therefore not have the chance to think about the scientific and personal implications of love.Yet it’s a curse because, by the halfway point, it becomes painfully obvious that the show will not forego the status quo. Instead, it keeps the narrative in a tug-of-war match that only induces frustration and tiredness the further it goes. This lack of progression means less insight and more of the same drama revisited in a stale fashion.Must one or the other be selected? Perhaps not. But when Koi to Uso tries very hard to make it seem so throughout the season, and then fails to resolve much (if anything) come the end, it somewhat defeats the purpose of having to make a choice between the two in the first place.Overall, this anime has interesting ideas about love and creates some nice setups for its story to talk about the concept. Sadly, it restricts the premise, it upholds too many writing problems, and it lacks a definitive answer to the question it posits. So, altogether, this narrative is by no means “the one” in this context.ART & ANIMATIONAmong the anime’s key traits, Koi to Uso’s artistry arguably ranks in the middle of the lot.To its credit, the designs of the characters at least stand out in some regard. Yes, Neji’s short brown hair and unassuming looks unfortunately paint him as a rather bland person. But Misaki, Ririna, and Nisaka do not succumb to this same problem.Instead, the love interests have a few details to call their own. Neji (and the audience) lose themselves in the girls’ large (almost too large) eyes as they look on with affection. Flushed fingers and long lashes increase their prettiness without calling attention to themselves as well. Individually, Misaki’s medium-length hair and generous proportions increase her physical attractiveness, and Ririna’s refined beauty evokes for her a cute, docile aura. As for Nisaka, his purple motif gives him a cool appearance, and his thinner eyes incite his standoffish personality well enough.Besides the nice character designs, the lighting within the show also has a small foothold. Vibrant nighttime scenes with glowing fireflies. A sunset cascading into a classroom as a gentle breeze shifts the curtains around. Shadowing techniques as they start to get a bit frisky. While not incredible, Koi to Uso likes to play around with the lighting in its scenes when and where it can.Speaking of “frisky,” the anime also isn’t afraid to showcase its distinct advances, highlighting the passions of the characters therein with kissing and caressing aplenty. Some of the slight ecchi moments perhaps do not belong in this drama, though. They could be chalked up to a meta aspect of the visuals that reflects their sexual ignorance, but that seems like a stretch. At any rate, the show includes a few comedic styles and backgrounds on occasion to change up its usually serious self.Otherwise, the anime is very straightforward in its presentation. The setting and the direction do not do a whole lot to engage the audience, and the actual animation neither improves nor does anything too interesting. Worse still, artistic errors sometimes creep their way in. For instance, in episode eight, Nisaka’s mouth continues moving as he walks down some steps despite not speaking anymore.Again, though, the designs, the various lighting techniques, and the attempts at varied styles prevent the visuals from falling out of favor. Meaning, the show delivers a passable artistic direction for this love-filled story.CHARACTERSThe characters of Koi to Uso must contend with those occasionally tumultuous, often invigorating feelings of love. Neji, Misaki, Ririna, and Nisaka go about it in their own way, but they also have clear parallels which tie them together.Most notably, these characters are quite naïve when it comes to love in and of itself. Indeed, they often think about and ask a philosophical question: “What is love?” To them, the “powers that be” have controlled their outlooks and their thoughts on the subject their entire lives. So, it makes valid sense that exchanging an eraser, listening in earnest, or sticking up for someone sparks those skip-a-beat feelings that they do not yet fully comprehend.Their naivety also explains their reactionary behavior, for each of them responds to love in a similar yet distinct manner. Neji caves to the thoughts and actions which so easily influence him. Misaki runs away from and lies about her feelings. Ririna romanticizes romance with a starry-eyed expression. And Nisaka goes wholly on the defensive, remaining aloof in his mindset. Without a doubt, love plays a big part in their personalities.That’s them as a grouping. On their own, these four teenagers not only have different places within Koi to Uso but also have different purposes as well. The two most interesting cast members that fit this description are the ones who get along the least: Ririna and Nisaka.While Ririna’s backstory as a sickly child receives the bare minimum of attention, it accounts for much of her persona. Awkward social behavior, lack of companionship, idolization of romance. Her starting point within this series may in fact be the lowest among the cast simply because she, unlike everyone else, finds love only now and therefore understands the least about it.Thus, her bonds with Neji and the others grant her better relationships and allow her to discover a more realistic view on love. She befriends Misaki and a fellow classmate at her school as she opens up to them, and she learns from Neji and Misaki in equal parts that her feelings equate to a tangible, meaningful existence. So, seeing her evolve from a lonely girl to a mature lady becomes a high point of this series.Nisaka doesn’t evolve as much as Ririna, but he plays an important role within Koi to Uso: maintaining a rational perspective. He often lets Neji bounce ideas off him so that he can in turn dish out his calm advice on the situation. Advice that comes directly from his heart. He can be a bit too tactless, but he has care within him, like when he is willing to put up with the school festival if it would mean making his best friend happy. Either way, when Neji caves, Misaki lies, and Ririna romanticizes, Nisaka keeps that cool of his (save for when his family rolls around), forming a nice contrast in the grounded stance he takes as compared to those three.Unfortunately, Koi to Uso ignores Nisaka’s character to some extent. His interactions with Misaki and Ririna are few and far between despite their collective, interconnected circumstances with and towards Neji. Which is doubly odd for Misaki since his (heavily implied) feud of sorts with her doesn’t mean much or go anywhere meaningful.As for Misaki and Neji, they fall further behind. The entire season, Misaki lies about how she truly feels, fitting her character well enough and imposing a strangeness within the dynamics. She even goes so far as to “betray” her friendship with Ririna in that she at one point secretly wishes for her to fail. As she sadly says, “It’s a cruel thing…loving someone.”Yet the anime never reveals the true motive behind why she cannot follow her heart’s desires. Some guesses can be made (e.g., she’s lying about being matched with someone else already, she has a terminal illness that literally prevents a long-term relationship). However, without concrete proof, they’re nothing more than guesses. Her friend Igarashi appears later in the season to deliver extra information about Misaki, but most of the audience already knew or at least could infer these repeated details. As such, she certainly remains shrouded in mystery but likewise stays in a static state with little to no progression.Similarly, Neji is the plain, main protagonist whose main hobby includes knowledge about burial mounds. So, naturally, he’s quite unintriguing, acting more as the vessel for this tale rather than a worthwhile person within it. Not to mention his simultaneous passivity and forwardness. Contradictory behavior for sure, yet it oddly works. In a writing sense, it reflects the tough decision he has before him: choosing between Misaki or Ririna as his bride-to-be.To flesh out Neji’s character, Koi to Uso juxtaposes him with Yajima. Surprisingly, this government dude had a personal love (implied to be his red-haired work partner) that he did not pursue, posing as a what-if for the impressionable guy. This tangent leads to a dead-end, though, because Yajima’s involvement and impact feels more like an aside rather than a point of purpose.Despite Misaki and Neji not having the greatest substance within this story, they stay true to themselves and have their tiny moments here and there. Plus, Nisaka’s role, Ririna’s arc, and the parallels present demonstrate that they all contend with their feelings on love no matter what.MUSIC & SOUNDWhen it comes to the music and the sound within Koi to Uso, its audio decisions reach a standstill of sorts.On the helpful side, its opening track provides a neat start. The OP, aptly titled “Kanashii Ureshii” due to its catchy lyrical content, begins each episode with a few peppy xylophone notes and a drum beat. However, the funky bass line, the harmonizing vocals, and the clapping interlude create in the song a passion and a somberness that reflects the emotions present throughout the season. Arguably, the dance-like, almost bubbly tone falls outside the scope of this dramatic tale insofar as the composition seems more aligned with a groovier structure rather than a direct appeal.

To be honest, I wouldn\'t mind letting an algorithm decide on my lifelong partner. Of course, I\'m against real-life arranged marriages, and the Sybil System from Psycho-Pass definitely rubs me the wrong way when you look at the society it creates, but the ""The Red Threads of Science"" actually matches you up with someone that\'s suitable for you, and benefits society by decreasing the number of single people and increasing birth rates. How much easier would life be if...you didn\'t have to worry about finding the love of your life? Also a better chance for sex at 16! What a great deal! Of course, there are many people that disagree with me, and Love and Lies focuses on one of them, Yukari Nejima. It\'s an interesting idea, one that could definitely be something incredibly enjoyable, but as you continue the show you start to realise it\'s not as good as you thought it would be.If it wasn\'t clear, this show is a love triangle. Yukari is in love with Misaki Takasaki, but his assigned partner is Ririna Sanada. Throw in a best friend, Yuusuke Nisaka, whose feelings towards the trio are quite the mystery, and we have all our main characters. On their own, the characters are all perfectly fine. Yukari is forward enough so that he isn\'t a complete pussy, Misaki and Ririna are both perfectly likeable girls and don\'t have any annoying character quirks, and Nisaka is kind of an enigma but an enjoyable enigma. (Although the mystery is never cleared up and we\'re left with character with vague intentions) The other frequent characters also fit well with the show, all having some sort of purpose to the progression of the story. However, once you take in the romance and drama, problems start to arise. First of all, there is one main issue I would like to address.Yukari is a bit of an ass...I\'m sorry, but he\'s just way too indecisive. Put yourself in the shoes of Ririna. You have been given a marriage partner by the government, but you find out he actually likes someone else. At first, you find this cute and decide to support him by pushing the two together, but as things progress you start to develop feelings for him as well. Your first thought would be that you want that person to choose either you or the other girl. Of course, it\'s gonna hurt if he rejects you, and there might be some repercussions, but it\'d be better than prolonging the inevitable and causing even more emotional pain. However, your marriage partner can\'t fucking decide between you two. This is the problem. I know it would be terrible for the show if Yukari just chose one of them early, the story would no longer have a reason to continue its love triangle and be forced to move onto something else or just end it there, but it\'s just not fun knowing that either one our main girls or both of them are gonna end up getting hurt really badly when it all could have been prevented with a simple answer.The romance also suffers from plot convenience and pointlessness. The reason shown in the first episode behind Yukari\'s and Misaki\'s feelings for each other is incredibly forced. They tried to set up a couple way too fast and caused it to feel stupid and unbelievable. Later on, we do get some more development that allows us to make better sense of the pairing, but we\'re still suffering from the recoil of that first episode that we\'re struggling to see the love as genuine. As the show goes on, our main\'s feeling is pretty one-sided, with the occasional monologue of ""Do I like Ririna?"" and ""What is love?"" (Baby don\'t hurt me) A lot of the progression in the relationship is between Yukari and Misaki, with Ririna in the background like a knock-off cheerleader that desperately needs some attention. It makes you wonder why exactly the love triangle was created in the first place if you were only gonna focus on one couple. Either give both girls an equal amount of romantic screen time or scrap one of them, because the way this show is doing it\'s love triangle is incredibly annoying. The ending only makes the whole ordeal even more frustrating, but going any further would be spoilers.The drama is ok, but it also relies on a lot of plot convenience and plot points that don\'t get explored enough. An example can be seen in the first episode, as Yukari gets an email on his phone about who his assigned partner. At first, it shows Misaki Takasaki as his chosen partner, but the phone suddenly glitches and disappears. Then two government officials appear out of nowhere and hand him a notice in an envelope, stating his partner is now Ririna Sanada. Okey dokey, so first of all, what the actual fuck? That\'s not how an email works. What kind of next level hacker is in this anime trying to bring up the hopes of some random high school kid and send them crashing back down? This scene was only done as an incredibly weak set up for drama, relying on its audience to turn off their brains for a minute so they don\'t collapse from the ridiculousness of the situation. The worse thing is that it never is explained, it\'s just brought up a couple of times to fulfil its job as drama set up and thrown back into storage, never seen again. Also, how did the government officials know where to find Yukari? To make it clear, he is not sitting at home happily waiting for his notice, he\'s out at a park in the middle of the night. There is absolutely no way for anyone to know where he was unless he was tagged or being followed for the entire night, and I doubt that\'s what happened. There are many other scenes that use plot convenience and create plot points that are never touched back on, but listing them would be tedious and spoil the anime.I really wanted to like Love and Lies, cause the premise was something I was genuinely interested in. Sadly, too many issues popped up and I spent too much time picking apart bits and pieces to properly enjoy the show. Although, I\'m sure a lot of people here can look past the issues I saw and really enjoy the anime, so go ahead. Pick the show up and see how you like it yourself. Just don\'t drop it after the first episode. Don\'t let a piece of school stationery scare you away.Thanks for Reading, Send Feedback if You Have Any! you didn\'t have to worry about finding the love of your life? Also a better chance for sex at 16! What a great deal! Of course, there are many people that disagree with me, and Love and Lies focuses on one of them, Yukari Nejima. It\'s an interesting idea, one that could definitely be something incredibly enjoyable, but as you continue the show you start to realise it\'s not as good as you thought it would be.If it wasn\'t clear, this show is a love triangle. Yukari is in love with Misaki Takasaki, but his assigned partner is Ririna Sanada. Throw in a best friend, Yuusuke Nisaka, whose feelings towards the trio are quite the mystery, and we have all our main characters. On their own, the characters are all perfectly fine. Yukari is forward enough so that he isn\'t a complete pussy, Misaki and Ririna are both perfectly likeable girls and don\'t have any annoying character quirks, and Nisaka is kind of an enigma but an enjoyable enigma. (Although the mystery is never cleared up and we\'re left with character with vague intentions) The other frequent characters also fit well with the show, all having some sort of purpose to the progression of the story. However, once you take in the romance and drama, problems start to arise. First of all, there is one main issue I would like to address.Yukari is a bit of an ass...I\'m sorry, but he\'s just way too indecisive. Put yourself in the shoes of Ririna. You have been given a marriage partner by the government, but you find out he actually likes someone else. At first, you find this cute and decide to support him by pushing the two together, but as things progress you start to develop feelings for him as well. Your first thought would be that you want that person to choose either you or the other girl. Of course, it\'s gonna hurt if he rejects you, and there might be some repercussions, but it\'d be better than prolonging the inevitable and causing even more emotional pain. However, your marriage partner can\'t fucking decide between you two. This is the problem. I know it would be terrible for the show if Yukari just chose one of them early, the story would no longer have a reason to continue its love triangle and be forced to move onto something else or just end it there, but it\'s just not fun knowing that either one our main girls or both of them are gonna end up getting hurt really badly when it all could have been prevented with a simple answer.The romance also suffers from plot convenience and pointlessness. The reason shown in the first episode behind Yukari\'s and Misaki\'s feelings for each other is incredibly forced. They tried to set up a couple way too fast and caused it to feel stupid and unbelievable. Later on, we do get some more development that allows us to make better sense of the pairing, but we\'re still suffering from the recoil of that first episode that we\'re struggling to see the love as genuine. As the show goes on, our main\'s feeling is pretty one-sided, with the occasional monologue of ""Do I like Ririna?"" and ""What is love?"" (Baby don\'t hurt me) A lot of the progression in the relationship is between Yukari and Misaki, with Ririna in the background like a knock-off cheerleader that desperately needs some attention.

Either give both girls an equal amount of romantic screen time or scrap one of them, because the way this show is doing it\'s love triangle is incredibly annoying.

The characters were well developed and the romance was really good. The art and sound are very good. The story was really good with the romance going on between the guy and the two girls. Both girls were perfect and then a guy who's not that bad looking. I enjoyed this anime as it would be hard to choose between the two female characters and the ending was somewhat good. Its better than making one of them hurt and that'll be sad so I guess its good that the ending didn't make one of the girls sad. "", ""The series started strong. I'll be explaining my scores not with too much detail. I'll tell you this: I'M OBSESSED WITH THE OPENINGThe story wasn't as all over the place as I thought it would be. Considering the plot is about the govt. choosing your spouse at age 16 there was so many ways it can go and sometimes anime goes in all those directions to satisfy viewers. Luckily, it came off pretty clear and of course built up hope. TBH I didn't know who to root for. I wish the ending were different. It felt like there wasn't really a solution to the story...IMO but I wasn't unsatisfied 100% so I guess that says something.Despite their big eyes which can be haunting the art was amazing... to me. It carried light and dark undertones based on scene rather than mood for the most part and came out clear cut with detail. If I can notice every single detail of the dress of the character than they were thinking of that much and I love thatSound wasn't gross. The voices weren't dramatic on the Japanese and they spoke in a way that it was anime approved but not like too squeaky and annoying.There wasn't much of any character development just about at all. Hence the ending. You ever feel like without CD the story goes no where? Like I said the ending wasn't 100% bad for me because I have gotten way worse but it was pretty bad. The end could've given so many things and we got nothing from it. The main character stayed basically the same and his friend had more character development and he's supporting. So that was heart breaking.Despite the characters and the end I did enjoy it. How can you not? I looked forward to the opening song every time I started a new episode. Seriously, it's flapjacking catchy. Anyway! I suggest you watch it if you are that curious but if you like an actual solution to your end and developing characters then don't bother. Just a suggestion. It's theme and art reminded me of Scum's Wish, which if you haven't seen it please do, it' why I was drawn to watch this. The summary is so enticing compared to the result. I still enjoyed it though, you might too. Watch at your own riskEnjoy! :3 IMO but I wasn't unsatisfied 100% so I guess that says something.Despite their big eyes which can be haunting the art was amazing... to me.

I choose not to read this manga, because i am usually busy with other things (i'm looking at you Persona 5). But i digress and i want to give my own personal review of the anime so far. Also i want to say majority of this review was based of the first ep. i wrote a review awhile back and it was taken down which is completely understandable. So lets just dive in.Story- The...premise of the story seems like a pretty basic love story with the main character falling in love with someone they knew since childhood. Yes its been beaten to death, but what Koi to Uso does to set it apart from other Romance anime is that the government regulates marriages when they become of age  Also come on who hasn't helped out someone in need, especially if its your crush.  - 8Art- MY God is this one of the best looking anime of 2017. I literally loved the art direction and animations in Koi to Uso. I was surprised to see studio LIDENFILMS up their animations granted i only recall seeing Yamada Kun to 7 from them. Also LIDEN made those giant moe eyes in which i usually dislike actually enjoyable to llok at. (Just so you know i hated the clannad eyes) looked like they were staring into my soul with no emotion). - 9Sound- The anime does well in its song choices granted I did not enjoy the op too much, but the ending and then adding the song just perfect. Not much other that so its good. -8Character- Initially the characters appeared to be taken from the (usual i love you from first sight trope) which has been like i said beaten to death. But that is until the next couple of episodes the show finally found to stand on its own two legs and add some of its own personalities to the their characters. Yeah it may not be anything new, but it definitely is smarter than the average fan service romance anime. Also there is a major curve ball in which i did not see coming in episode 2 or 3 which made the show more distinguished than other anime, but again i need to see more interaction of the characters.  -8Enjoyment- I'm a simple man when i see something that resembles something close to what i have experienced i'm going to love it. Also who doesn't love seeing the two main characters actually confess their feelings and not having it become a recurring (oh i wish i confessed before all this happened sort of scenario). so - 9Overall-  So far the first couple of episodes has been an overall great experience and a much needed refresher for this long time anime watcher and i feel the first ep was a strong start to the anime, but also shows some flaws (Cough.. cough... eraser scene). If we see more character involvements and handling situations (which they are in later epidsodes) to test their actual love for each other i could see this anime become one of the best of the season, but so far the ever so perfect shounen MHA season 2 and the biggest surprise for me this season Ballroom e Youkoso are ahead. Just watch the first ep koi to uso and give it a shot.This is my first review and i would gladly welcome criticism so i can improve my writing abilities.P.S- Like i said majority of the review was based of the original review i wrote based on the first ep. I know more goes on so if you are little confused i am sorry. I hope to write a more in depth review when i finish, but i want to write, because i believe this anime needs more credit then it deserves, but hey everyone has their opinion. Also for the eraser scene the show did mention more, but it was not too much which i am ok with, but more would have been nice.Anywaaaaays......Thanks for reading premise of the story seems like a pretty basic love story with the main character falling in love with someone they knew since childhood.

At the the end of the anime did i get that fuzzy feeling when it comes to happy endings? or that that deep pit from the loss of a good anime? Nope all i felt was defeat like why the hell did i watch that? Give me back my wasted time. What was the whole point of that anime? To show that true love is real and you should follow your guts? then why did the main character have such hard time choosing and was...doubting his choice.Or was it to show that the government selections were right all along? Is thats how it is why make the anime i the first place? So disappointed i myself that i actually watched this at least you could have put some decent fanservice i you weren't gonna provide me with a story worth watching doubting his choice.Or was it to show that the government selections were right all along?

The storyline is definitely interesting though. For example, the storyline take you in of how the story will end up, and if the love can really be found scientifically since many couples (insignificant people in anime) end up as a couple. So then this anime always asks, ""What is love."" Really, everyone wonders about that and love is a mysterious thing. Anywayyyy, the story line was very interesting.The problem for me was the romance. There were moments that I thought it was sweet, and the first episode will totally blow up your mind if...you are into slow romance. I do not want to spoil it, but if you do not enjoy seeing French kisses, and the saliva from the mouth falling out, I recommend to just be sure to keep in mind this😅 Since as for me, French kisses are a bit extreme, especially in action.Another problem was the main character, I would honestly want Nisaka or Misaki to be the mc. Why you ask? The mc seems to not try to change or keep in mind that he may be hurting others since he is so thick headed to not see some people\'s love for him. Well, him being pushed to move on is normal since there needs to be some support at times, but I really would like for the mc to stick to one person he loves.It makes sense to not want to hurt others you care about or if you have sincere feelings more than one person, but the mc just seems to lure people to fall in love with him more (unintentionally of course, and that\'s why it\'s stupid, sorry to say).Any, I recommend this anime if you are looking for something interesting, but be sure to keep in mind that there are French kisses😅 you are into slow romance.

The 'red ribbon of fate'. At first glance it was a must watch for me, I love anime that comes across as light hearted but have dark undertones. When I began Koi to Uso I was sure it would be one of the greatest of the summer 17 anime's.HOWEVERI am extremely dissappointed with how the anime played out, ending without a proper ending or a coherent conclusion. So my questions were left unanswered and it was overall very anti-climatic.Story:The concept was great but poorly executed. The love of your life being chosen for you, it...all seemed like it was going in the right direction. However the plot all falls apart with the introduction of some very annoying characters.Characters:Takasaki, the love of Nejima Yukari's life, was the bane of this anime. I hated her!

I can understand why; the themes seem rather obvious, the story is predictable, and there are liberal applications of cliche all throughout.  So why, then, am I assigning it such a high score?I think people are too concerned with being good ""critics"" and aren\'t enjoying life enough.  Really pay attention to the musical score when Misaki confesses to Nejima.  That one musical piece redeems the entire existence of this creative endeavor, from the manga to the anime and everything related to it.  It evokes the illogical nature of love,...how someone can inspire us for a singular moment in our lives and we are changed forever.  If you forget about being all crabby and critical for a moment and let yourself feel what these two must be feeling in that scene, you will not fail to be moved unless you really do completely lack any sense of romance.  In my mind\'s eye, I could imagine walking down one of those wooden walkways through a forest of bamboo hand in hand with youthful love.  All of the heartbreak and hardship in the world seems to have not been in vain and everything is OK because this one person loves you, too.Forget for a moment that it\'s hard to root for Nejima\'s milksop character; he is not intended to be someone we can obviously say women would find attractive.  He\'s made that way on purpose.  Misaki doesn\'t love Nejima because he\'s cool or rich or can do special things for her.  She loves him because she was moved and thinks his courage and spirit are beautiful.  And it\'s not hard to fall in love with Misaki despite her flaws: after all, her voice actor is Onadera from Nisekoi.  (My God, if someone confessed to me with Kana Hanazawa\'s voice I would break down and propose on the spot.)  Nejima is meant to be the protagonist, the one the reader is supposed to experience the situation through.The central choice in this story presented to us is basically: ""Do you love with your heart or with your mind?""  Do you choose the one you\'ve loved all along for no single reason you can place your finger on, or do you pick a person who ticks all the boxes, someone whom everyone thinks would make a great match for you?  I get that a lot of things could have been handled better.  I get that the anime adaptation we got contains a lot of awkward moments in it.  But as an artistic endeavor, many of the scenes are rich with symbolism that evoke people through the ages asking themselves this very question:  Marry for idealistc love, or pursue career, political gain, material riches?Things get complicated when Ririna enters the picture.  The choices are not quite so straightforward anymore when real people are involved, because Ririna is presented as straightforward, earnest, thoughtful, and beautiful.  Nejima can\'t help but be attracted to her, and honestly we are meant to understand why with our heads how Ririna would make a fine life partner.  Life is like that: we can talk about the red string of fate all we want but the person we end up with often is NOT the childhood crush.  Maybe it\'s timing.  Maybe it\'s lack of opportunity.  Maybe it\'s some evil government policy which seeks to put people together so they cut down on the incidence of violent crimes and depression.  Whatever the reason, we\'re SUPPOSED to be sympathetic to Ririna, who doesn\'t do anything wrong and is very appealing in her own right.I want to write about Yuusuke, but that whole situation just seems kind of tacked on and unnecessary to the main theme here.  Maybe the writers were thinking that unrequited love needed fair representation.  After all, in the beginning Nejima and Misaki are on exactly the same page.  Personally, while I understand his inclusion I thought this just muddied the waters and was a poor attempt to expose uglier parts of Misaki\'s character, making choosing her less obvious for the viewer.If you still hate this anime, you might just be one of those people who can only tick all the boxes and doesn\'t take a moment to get in touch with your romantic self.  That\'s fine, the anime itself doesn\'t try to ram a choice down our throats, saying one is better than another.  And maybe that\'s also a reason why people are upset or disappointed: they themselves feel there is an obvious choice (for them) and don\'t understand why everyone else doesn\'t see it that way.  Personally, I found the work to be beautiful, but I\'m a bit biased.

This is it. More or less:The animation/art has flaws, but it\'s more about the plot than anything else. A couple years ago, books about dystopian societies were in, and as an avid YA books reader I have read a fair share of them. This AU is not that different from these (see Delirium, Matched, etc). My point is that if you liked those you will for sure like this one. It is not as ""hey let\'s fix this unfair situation, down with the bad guys ""...as The Hunger Games or Delirium, but it\'s still good.Characters are not that original, they reminded me a bit of Scum\'s Wish characters, maybe not /that/ screwed up tho. Still likeable, at least Ririna found a way to my heart with her bluntness and kind heart, I found myself waiting for her scenes with the main character tbqh.Anyways [s/p/o/i/l/erinos] ahead.I hate the end, and I hate that I had to read the manga to find the """"true ending"""", and I hate that they are going to make a movie with the actual end so until someone kind translates it I won\'t be able to know the end!!! So if you dont like open endings dont watch, but STILL it was so enjoyable Id watch it again tbh??? as The Hunger Games or Delirium, but it\'s still good.Characters are not that original, they reminded me a bit of Scum\'s Wish characters, maybe not /that/ screwed up tho.

The government controls the ""red strings of science"" that bring about perfect matches which turn into perfect marriages. Love with any other is strictly forbidden. However for fifteen year old Nejima Yukari, he finds a love separate from his assigned partner. Which one is the lie?...The anime keeps a nice pacing for how short it is. It doesn\'t tell the full story, twelve episodes rarely do, but the audience is slowly introduced to the main cast and presented two options. Should Yukari forget his long time love and trust the government to match him with the perfect partner? Or shall he go against the system, and take free love back for himself? The story is never very clear on which girl the audience should be rooting for. There\'s reason for both to be the one. Love & Lies takes the viewer through the day to day of a complicated romance. It mirrors real life in that way, only what could be made easy for the protagonist is not.The premise is intriguing, a factor which encouraged your humble writer to take up this show. However as the scenes carry on and it becomes increasingly more difficult to root for one girl or the other, the show starts to lose its meaning. If it was created to present a proposition, what is the point of watching if a true story cannot be extracted out of 4.8 hours spent watching?The art is another one of the main forces compelling this anime enthusiast to include it on the ""To Watch"" list. Love & Lives possesses a cute and simple style. Feelings about the eyes are a mixture of love and hate. Sometimes they seem too big and a grim reminder of the dark ages of anime style, but other time they hold much expression. Each design for characters is different and unique, and it was a pleasant surprise to see each of the main cast having a family that shared common features (a design choice that is somehow missed a surprising number of times in other series).For the average viewer, the art is a plus. For the snooty and seasoned veteran, the eyes may be a little distracting during viewership. And for this one? The art is considered acceptable. The animation turned out to be lazy and suspicious in some scenes, but LIDENFILMS has a budget. All anime suffers from this at some point or another in an episode.At first listen, the opening was not much to speak of. It has a simple melody with a decent performance by Frederic. The tone is rather upbeat, but the lyrics are a bit darker in that they serve the story to a ""T"". Love is difficult indeed. The more your dedicated viewer refused to skip the opening, the more it took ahold of her sing-song heart. The opening turned catchy. Definitely one of the better ones of this season if given a chance.With help from Prime Video, the ending theme was never really given much of a chance before the next episode started playing, but it screams standard J-pop. Roys has a beautiful voice and sings more about how Takasaki Misaki is feeling. It matches the show\'s aesthetic, and provides a nice wind down from the events of the episode prior. Unfortunately, it is also completely skippable. Nothing in the song really grips attention, pretty as it is.As for the original soundtrack, your humble writer suggests opening YouTube and surrendering an hour, thirteen minutes, and forty-one seconds to music that has personality. Each piece really belongs to Love & Lies, and each piece can bring about a memory of a scene. It is a soundtrack truly applaud worthy, as it gives the show depth; hat second layer of feeling.An average boy, a conflicted girl with a mask, a disagreeable loli, and a handsome loner are what this show has to work with. It is almost impossible to form a favorite character from any of the cast. Either all the characters are amazing, or abysmal. Regrettably Love & Lies\'s main cast falls into that second category.Nejima Yukari is an average boy who falls in love with someone who isn\'t his arranged marriage partner. He doesn\'t have confidence, much drive, and the audience is forced to accept his love for burial mounds without much reasoning. He is fickle, and indecisive, and positively the worst character in the series\' main cast.Takasaki Misaki is a beautiful and smart girl who happens to be the subject of Yukari\'s affections. Her main personality is that of a person who puts on a brave face and hides her feelings, stuffs them under a mask and pretends everything is alright. She\'s presented as the damsel in distress for most of the series, and it tends to become quite . . . distressing.Sanada Ririna is the loli of the snow. She is blunt, says what she wants, but also cannot seems to really figure out what it is that she truly desires. Her whole character is a tad bit confusing, as she is used as the person that just makes everything ""work"" in the story. Her role is simply to further or complicate the plot as seen fit.Nisaka Yuusuke, friend of the protagonist, and brooding loner has a lot of potential. It is hinted at that he has much more backstory than the show covers. A fact which becomes highly aggravating as he could be the series\' most interesting character, but ends up as a backdrop that keeps getting pulled into the spotlight. Not much is done with him, even though he has the most than could be tinkered with.When all is said and done, this show is a good watch -- if you\'re trying to take a break from watching something else, which this critic indeed happened to be doing. The beginning, when all characters were being introduced and the story was starting to take off was a time when the series could be considered an eight. But as scenes continued on, and plot started moving and characters began developing, the end result was so minuscule that everything the story could have built up to became a major disappointment. Does the viewer ever get the answer to the question it presents? The answer would be the same as this one saying ""Why don\'t you find that out for yourself?""Overall, the series had a great start with it\'s premise and pretty art, but as it tried to get more series and philosophical with it\'s ideas, it shot itself in the foot, never really committing to a certain flow. Any questions it asks requires the reader to find the answers within themselves. It\'s hard to root for any one of the characters, as none of them are exactly root-worthy.

So so unfortunate.', 'On paper, the premise of Love and Lies would seem like a unique one that could have delved into the societal issues that arose from the Yukari System, where the Japanese government mandates arranged marriages between its populace to curb its decreased population. This issue is delved into with focus on Yukari Nejima, a young man who finally works up the resolve to admit his feelings to childhood crush Misaki Takasaki until he receives notification that he has been arranged a marital partner by the Japanese government. However, Yukari\'s marital partner, Ririna Sanada, has no interest in Yukari as a marriage partner and tries to...mend relations between him and Misaki, the latter choosing to distance herself from Yukari upon learning of his arranged marriage. At the same time, Yukari and Ririna try to publicly maintain the mandated arrangement made for them by the government, as rejecting it has serious societal consequences.In spite of its rather unique premise though, Love and Lies mostly focuses on the love triangle between our main trio of Yukari, Misaki, and Ririna. While this typically wouldn\'t be so bad a case as romance anime has made some memorable lover triangles over the years, this isn\'t really the case for Love and Lies as the characters here are too shallow to give much of a hoot about in their romantic endeavors as Yukari\'s too milquetoast as out male lead and the two girls connected to him are not much better off. Worst off, the love triangle doesn\'t really go anywhere either as Yukari is too hesitant to make any major move, Misaki seems to be holding back on her feelings and doesn\'t have much to show as a character to get a read on her emotions, and Ririna is mostly focused on trying to hook up the two other characters (though her character does get some gradual development compared to Misaki and Yukari). The anime does devote some focus on the flaws of the Yukari System with the government pushing developments on the arranged couples they make, but this is largely window dressing in focus compared to the anime\'s focus on its shallow love triangle. These major issues are bad enough as such where the anime ends inconclusively in resolving how the three lead characters get around the Yukari System to get their ideal relationships.Perhaps the only praise I could give the series is its artwork. Scenic shots are vast and highly detailed with vivid colors and the characters are drawn with realistic body proportions in mind, though female characters are drawn with the ""big doe-eyed"" character design style traditionally depicted in many anime titles.Otherwise, Love and Lies is mostly quite messy as a romance anime. While its premise had potential to be an interesting piece of social commentary, this mostly played second fiddle to the rather pitiful love triangle that the series attempted to push as nothing went anywhere with it and the characters were mostly too shallow to care much for them. Fans of romance anime should definitely skip this one. mend relations between him and Misaki, the latter choosing to distance herself from Yukari upon learning of his arranged marriage.

Fans of romance anime should definitely skip this one.', '""What does it mean to love someone?""...Koi to Uso, calm down on your symbolism.Koi to Uso comes with an interesting premise of the system of ""The Red Threads of Science"" where people are assigned partners for the rest of their life to stop the decline of birth rates. Yukari Nejima voiced by Ryota Osaka is such an interesting case where he had a crush on Misaki Takasaki voiced by Kana Hanazawa since he was kid but when the notice for Yukari\'s partner was abruptly changed from Misaki to Ririna, things changes for Yukari.This premise is quite interesting for the fact of showing us whether government...law can produce results in a healthy relationship or whether true love can conquer this. However in the case of Koi to Uso, it kinda broke it\'s own rules and ruined it in the process.Before LA talks about that.....characters.Since this is a rather character-relationship driven narrative, LA will look at each of the major characters one at a time.First is Yukari Nejima, our main narrative focused protagonist.......he\'s just your ordinary high school boy with a crush with no really redeeming features about him (besides he\'s a nice guy and likes burial mounds), he\'s actually the most uninteresting character in this series to be quite honest, he\'s essentially an audience proxy as to how the system of ""The Red Threads of Science"" works.Next is LA\'s favourite character Ririna Sanada voiced by Yui Makino, Yukari\'s assigned partner. LA really just liked her naive tsundereness (leaning more to dere) and just how she shook the entire situation of Yukari and Misaki. However her naivete is also her downfall, being from a rich family and being awkward in school, she kinda misses the point sometimes and gets into misunderstandings alot with Yukari. But later on she does develop feelings for Yukari and her life changes as she gets used to school life, have friends from her school as well as Misaki. Nonetheless LA was rooting for her and it\'s not just because she was LA\'s favourite character.Next is Misaki Takasaki, Yukari\'s childhood crush, really the only thing going for her is that she\'s a childhood friend and seeing the childhood friend win would have been a refreshing sight in anime and again going aback to the entire ""true love conquers"" works into her quite well. As much as LA likes Ririna, having Misaki ""win"" would hold true for the anime at hand and hell to that because of this, Misaki becomes an interesting character, not LA\'s favourite but more interesting to see this outcome. The only problem with Misaki is that although she\'s interesting nothing much about her is interesting such as the case of Yukari as well. It\'s Yukari and Misaki\'s relationship that makes them interesting not individual themselves.Finally we have Yuusuke Nisaka voiced by Shinnosuke Tachibana, best friend of Yukari and he\'s kinda got a secret of his own and LA is totally fine with it. Overall he\'s the guy that gets the less flack within this entire ordeal.So about the rules breaking for ""The Red Threads of Science"" system, well for one if the arranged partner skips out on the system, they get a stigma towards society which also affects their futures as well......but then later on it tells us there\'s a loophole that bypass all this...then what\'s the point of the system?, also the anime is persistent in telling us all these rules are absolute and the majority of testing says it proves it works, not to mention Yukari\'s sudden change of notices from Misaki to Ririna also breaks the system. LA might get why some of these are put in place, saying that the government isn\'t all knowing and isn\'t 100% correct in it\'s own system and again true love conquers all, but yeah if the rule about the arranged partner skipping out along with it\'s loophole is anything to go by, Yukari could have just as easily be with Misaki with no resistance by the end of it because the SYSTEM screwed up not Yukari.The anime goes through some typical stuff in a melodramatic love triangle romance anime as well, from a crossdressing Romeo and Juliet play to ughhh sex lectures, going to a marriage and even a bridal model shoot. All typical and all, but these events only prolong Yukari\'s decision on who he\'s gonna pick and Jesus do they prolong it. So LA talked briefly about the obnoxious symbolism in Koi to Uso and it\'s everywhere especially the concept of Love and Lies. Mainly it\'s symbolism is Yukari seeing Misaki and Ririna as Love and Lies (sometimes vice versa) but the thing is it goes back to the question of ""What does it mean to love someone?""...but the thing is they spout this phrase as well as the same words of Love and Lies CONSTANTLY, like LA knows it\'s from the title and the symbolism is there, but if we have a indecisive main protagonist it gets old pretty quickly as we want him to choose. To be honest LA wouldn\'t mind going the yuri route for Misaki and Ririna due to how bland Yukari is...but that\'s LA\'s wildcard.So in speaking of routes, who does Yukari choose by the end?...well yes Yukari does tell us through a conversation with Ririna, however the final scenes are left ambiguous as to who he\'s gonna choose if not BOTH. Two questions, if he picks both, won\'t the government get on Yukari\'s case about this and leaving an ending this vaguely ambiguous is gonna piss some people off...some of them being LA as LA was pleading the finale for Yukari to pick someone (as for LA, both sides would have won, choose Ririna, LA would have liked it because favourite character, choose Misaki, seeing the childhood friend win would be refreshing) instead it\'s left rather ambiguous if Yukari would go through with their plan...if anything LA was rather pissed and at the same time mixed with this kind of ending.Koi to Uso from it\'s interesting premise that ruins itself falls under the typical love triangle spiel we have seen time and again and it prolongs the decision until the finale where it\'s left ambiguous...-sigh-. Well Koi to Uso, you showed love in MANY different ways but you definitely lied your way through the finale and not helping matters is the typical highschool romance settings bashing us in the face it\'s symbolism. This isn\'t the worst romance anime LA has seen but falls under the typical trappings of anime romance cliches and of not taking risks with it\'s romance and even ruining it\'s interesting premise in the process, it\'s a mess of indecisiveness and hormonal teenagers under a broken system not knowing what they are doing or what they truly want. law can produce results in a healthy relationship or whether true love can conquer this.

I thought to myself I could use some sparkle in my life so I browsed through the romance genre of manga. Koi to Uso immediately stuck out to me with it's very distinguishable art style. And that's where we will start with what I believe is Koi to Uso's strongest element, Art.The Manga of Koi to Uso had a visual flair very appropriate for romance. The character designs were very grounded as well as defining the characters archetype at a glance. And while some might have...an issue with the design of the eyes, I welcome it whole heartedly. In anime, movement and strength of the eyes can express the characters feelings that they would be unable to say themselves. And to that I would love to say that Koi to Uso's visual language is graciously sympatheic. It has a variety of extreme close up shots on lips or hand movement accentuating the nervousness. High angle shots on a slouching character in a time of weakness or distress. It is also very rare for a scene to skip a close up of the characters eyes, further emphasizing the importance of the eye.Moving away from the face, the body language is just as important. While we still get the common shots where it includes multiple characters standing there with little much to do while a few characters talk, I welcome them. Because not much is meant to happen. However, when the story is meant to be really personal we see shots of different angles often showing us the position most expressive of their feelings. I also feel that the cuts in this anime are almost of a perfect length. And length of the scenes are well paced, feeling neither rushed or too long to fit the episode.Besides the character design, my favorite aspect of animation in the anime is the lighting. Whether if it's broad daylight, a red dusk or in the middle of the night, the gradient layer of white at the corner of the shot accentuates the moment. The bright color palette is very nice but I feel Koi to Uso is at it's strongest at night. Dark colors conquer most of the screen, however, the few lightning we have on the characters express a sensual relationship with the uncertainty.Ironically, uncertainty is what I feel for the sound department in Koi to Uso. Unlike with the animation, the music does not know when to cut away. The music is mostly drawn out and tries it's best to express the mood of the scene. Contrary to it's purpose, it actually breaks the mood. As there were both verbal and visual dialogue and requires time to translate between the characters. The best thing to do would have had complete silence and when the characters are finally able to draw a conclusion through the dialogue is when the music should be executed. In addition, the soundtrack seems to be just a cut above average. The soundtrack seems to be very small. Although, the ending theme is very nice to listen to.I've always been a fan of Hanazawa Kana as her voice is really easy to listen to. Kana plays her archetype fine. Makino Yui on the other hand took me some time to relate her voice to Ririna. At times the visual language and verbal language didn't seem to match but I like her voice nonetheless. Ohsaka Ryouta voice I find to be very troll at times, and I mean that in a good way. His voice fits Yukari almost perfectly barring the times he speaks with Nisaka. When Yukari speaks with Nisaka, the pitch of his voice seems to shoot up a level emphasizing his ridiculous levels of sensuousness to Nisaka. All to incite Nisaka's inner tsundere towards Yukari. And while the VA are doing what they are supposed to be doing, it still bothers me. Selection of the VA's to the characters was pretty spot on, though.Lastly, it's very difficult to separate a story from characters. This is especially true in the slice of life genre where the story is heavily influenced by the characters interests and goals. However, the only thing on our main casts mind seem to be love. Besides Yukari's interest in Burial Mounds, Koi to Uso has very little material to build on. Resulting in simple plot development and a spiral of melodrama.While the story is very simple, it's not necessarily a bad thing. It allows the story to focus on our cast. The existence of the Marriage Plan is pretty ridiculous and is probably the only offender of ridiculous reasons to bring characters together and cause melodrama. It is also our source of fun, our reason for watching this series. The special events that forces the characters to bond do not feel random. Instead of having Yukari randomly meet Ririna out in the wild, they take the initiative to invite each other. Or their parents act as an intermediary. At least in the world of Koi to Uso, it all feels very plausible.My biggest gripe about the cast is really Yukari. He's mostly just a nice guy and lacks initiative or the strength to make his plans come to fruition. Regardless, I cheer for him to express his feelings. Ririna sits in the middle ground for me. At first, her actions are very questionable as we all know it's going to cause issues later. I empathize with her naivety, because she is forced to live with the consequences. Misaki is perhaps my favorite character from Koi to Uso. Being reluctant with her love for Yukari at first but choosing to let her feelings out when she can is all understandable.I very much enjoy that I can empathize with the characters of Koi to Uso. The dialogue always reminds of what the characters are feeling. The animation has a firm grasp of their feelings and well placed cuts keep the scene active although not much is happening. Although, less music would help with the atmosphere. And at times the volume of the sounds can be an issue.

For the first couple episodes the premise felt revolting, but at the same time original and having great potential to make a sad story and focus on the psychological aspect of the premise and how it affects the children.

As I matured and watched a lot of different series (anime and tv shows) I began watching things differently, I wanted to watch more actual good material. If the series you're looking for has to be actually good, I recommend skipping this one.[Story: 3 - Poor]At first the synopsis seems appealing, it made me curious about how the story would evolve. Sadly, the story developed very badly. The real 'plot' behind the series is set in motion by a...certain someone (not a main character) who does not have a clear motive of why she did it, and even if she had, it would not have been good enough, the series isn't thought that well through.[Art: 8 - Very Good]Not much to say about it, except that I found the art very pretty. The eyes stood out especially, eventhough they looked misplaced sometimes. Another perhaps fun thing to mention, is that I noticed that one of the female main characters looks like she has pudding for hair.[Sound: 7 - Good]The music was not that amazing and outstanding, yet it supported the visuals heavily. It only felt like such a waste that the same music was played over and over, which made me get a little annoyed sometimes.[Character: 3 - Poor]I really dislike to give this grade to this category, but in my honest opinion, it's not worth higher. The characters barely develop, aside from some obvious growing feelings toward others. Another big miss in the characters is background, there is just so much lacking that it couldn't make me feel empathy for any of the characters. Like one character does not want something (sorry for being vague, I cannot give further details due to spoilers) but no reason for this at all is revealed, which was pretty important.[Enjoyment: 6 - Fair]Despite the, in my opinion, bad plot and characters, I give this series an overall 6. This is solely because I happened to enjoy the first couple episodes and perphaps the nice looking visuals. certain someone (not a main character) who does not have a clear motive of why she did it, and even if she had, it would not have been good enough, the series isn't thought that well through.[Art: 8 - Very Good]Not much to say about it, except that I found the art very pretty.

Imagine living in a society where at the age of six, your country (Japan in this situation) scientifically paired you with someone who is PERFECTLY matched for you... you\'ll end up falling in love, having a great marriage and keeping the birthrates at a normal rate for your country!? Sounds almost perfect. But instead, we follow an awkward yet some how adorable Yukari Nejima whose had a crush on a girl since fifth grade. Before his 16th birthday, he confesses...his love to Misaki Takasaki who shares the same feelings; at 12:00am on the dot of his 16th birthday he gets paired up with someone who will become his future wife. Does his first love end in an unhappy way, does he end up discovering what true love is with his set up wife or does he just fuck up his life even more? Let\'s go with the the last one, shall we? The plot for the anime is so interesting, and the character set up and selection is perfect.... but god damn, everything is so cringy and all the questions the main cast keep asking themselves could be answered SO EASILY if they were just true to themselves. Art; the style is cute, and is consistent with the manga series which I\'ve been following for awhile. Sound; The opening is super cute, but the end song never satisfies me like I want it to. Characters; The cast isn\'t bad, and you get to learn a little bit of everyone... but not enough. I haven\'t already read the manga, I probably would\'ve felt like I watched twelve of characters with NO DEVELOPMENT and just random make-out scenes.Overall, I love the PLOT and the idea of ""At the age of 16 you can get paired with the perfect person"". They could\'ve worked a little bit harder on showing the characters heartfelt emotions, why they act a certain way or just overall explained Yukari\'s stupid reactions/notions during this whole anime.I don\'t think this series needs another season... I highly suggest people to read the manga if they had a bunch of questions that weren\'t answered in the anime...Finally, just for myself I HOPE Yukari ends up with the sweet Ririna Sanada <3 The scientifically perfect couple that doesn\'t want to admit they love each other because they don\'t want to hurt a friend/first-love.

In that, I would also find it very dividing, depending on what you expect out of a romance anime. I\'ll get more into that as I talk.Plot: 5/10The story is fairly generic at best. The plot focuses primarily as Yukari as tries to figure out where his affections truly lie (pun intended), either with his long time crush or his newly assigned wife. The show is heavily character driven, and flops a lot before of that, but more on that later. Pacing is slow, and some...scenes are just agonizing to watch. Several of the subplots have weak conclusions or flat out lack a conclusion overall. The overall conclusion flies in the face of how a romance story should be told, with the implications and hints built through the story being tossed out in favor of a very predictable ending (for those familiar with harem romantic trends) that ultimately does not satisfy. Finally, in my opinion, much of the backstory to explain the love triangle is really awkward, and unbelievable.Characters: 5/10This is being a bit generous giving it a 5 out of 10. The  main character, Yukari, is general laughable and boring, the kind of ""every man"" that we are suppose to project ourselves on, save for a weird obsession with burial mounds (which admittedly are interesting, but do nothing to redeem his character). The two heroines are actually rather distinct from one another, which is good. Only one of the heroines, the assigned wife Ririna shows any character growth beyond her initial introduction. The other significant character is Nisaka, who is often forgotten about anyways. The character interactions are weak and often unbelievable, which doesn\'t help the character driven plot. Most characters have some kind of subplot which are hinted at but never properly explored.Animation: 7/10While stylistically this anime stands out since it employs a less standard style of depiction, the character designs are ugly and/or awkward to look at. Personally, the eyes seem too big for me and result in some awkward camera angles.Soundtrack: 7/10Nothing particularly standout about it. The openning is pretty catchy though.Themes: 5/10The anime actually had some interesting themes in contrasting love verses lust. Tied into this was the idea of asking what love is. Unfortunately, the exploration of the themes was basically undone with the final conclusions and leaves the viewer ultimately confused. I honestly really like the themes, and the plot did a good job in building the themes up until the last few episodes.Overall, the anime had plenty of potential but flops on all levels to make it a mediocre watch for future anime fans.

This may be more of a rant...sorry,* * SPOILER ALERT * *The whole scientific tinder premise was enough to keep me watching until the end...well because I wanted to see an end...I was cheering for Misaki because I myself like to side with the idea of ""fate"" as opposed to this ""science""...but,I was also cheering for Ririna because (in my opinion) she was just far more likeable.So either way I most likely would have been satisfied with either choice. But nah, dude decided that he just wants to protect this ""solitary feeling of love.""I know there\'s a manga for this but I probably won\'t end up reading it.Art was alright, nothing astounding but was still good enough to look at.

It ends up being misunderstood and disliked by most, for mostly understandable reasons. However, in minds of some, the same series seems to make quite the unforgettable impact on. Koi to Uso is one of those series for me.;IMPURITY; within :PERFECTION:Now, hold on. The show has very obvious flaws within it? Maybe so. I\'d say, most people on the site have criticized it already for most of the lacking elements, so I decided not to dwell on them too much, for a reason...given later. In short, the story setting is rather forced, even if interesting. The comedy elements tend to stand out as well, as not fitting to the theme of the show too much. But even with all this, I decided to give this series a perfect score? Let me elaborate.:PERFECTION: within ;IMPURITY;Quite ironically, impurity is the theme of this show, so... Should these flaws be forgiven, maybe?Nah. I wouldn\'t go that far. However. You must think what the show is supposed to be about and what it\'s trying to convey in the end. And if you think about the goals this show is trying to accomplish, it does the job damn well. I have seen a lot of people hate the characters of Koi to Uso, and the ""development"" they go throughout the show, and list that as a flaw. Is it really though? I agree the characters make this show uncomfortable to watch, for sure. But thanks to this lack of comfort, one may take a step back and end up in a place unexplored before by their minds. Or at least, rarely explored by their minds at all.There is an enjoyment in a lack of enjoyment. Not many series can proudly achieve this type of state. It\'s rather commendable, really. And this, I believe, was the goal of the show from the very beginning. Credit should be given where credit is due, and shows are supposed to be watched as they were intended to be watched. I do not believe the aforementioned flaws hinder this experience, and so, while still relevant to some degree and definitely worth the mention, they should not be considered for the overall rating of the show.A quick mention on the soundtrack and art, as I also think they\'re rather phenomenal. The art style is very peculiar and you may not like it at first, but it will grow on you after some time. It differentiates the series from others very clearly in your mind too, which further helps solidify it as a unique experience. The soundtrack is great (although not very memorable, aside from op/ed), as it seems completely unfitting for the show it\'s used in. But the contrast it gives is a definitive highlight for me. It reminds us of other high-school drama we\'ve seen, and basically states that this one is unlike any other.WRAPPING UP the bright red strings of fate(and a TL;DR, partly)Koi to Uso is not for everybody. It provides a very unique experience, that will stay with you for a long time. Or a barely memorable one, that some will prefer to forget, even. After this review, you should be able to see which group you\'ll fall into. If it\'s the former, I guarantee you will not regret seeing this. And that is what truly matters, in the end.

From the very start I believed that this show would be something great, something that could change my perspective on life. In Hindsight I was wrong.Story: The story starts off with a bang introducing us to our main protagonist Yukari Nejima. We also meet the girl he is interested in Takasaki Misaki. We learn of how they met and all of the feelings that he kept for the five years of being with her. Nejima realizes however that when he gets his notice, he will never be able tell Misaki how he feels. Sounds...pretty good right? Well everything from that is downhill. I thought that from there the show would only get better and better, however half of the plot points that they introduce don't even have a solid conclusion. Even the main conflict with Nejima having to chose between Misaki and Sanada doesn't even get answered in the end. Overall the story was a mess.Characters: Most of the characters in this show are puppets. What I mean by this is that the characters feel like they have no life of their own. The characters do what they need to further the plot, and they are never talked about again. One example of this would be Shuu Igarashi. The moment Shuu was introduced into the show she seemed so interesting, and had so much promise. Even so, she was in one episode, and explained Misaki's love for Nejima(which we don't even know who Nejima chooses). When I saw this I thought it was a joke. A character that is related to the person who made the notices only gets 20 minutes of screentime for the whole show, and is only there to remind us, yeah Misaki likes Nejima. One of my favorite characters in the show was Nisaka, and that was only because of his growth throughout the show.Enjoyment: While I may say that the show was not what I expected story-wise, the show was decently enjoyable. I felt that the characters were just doing what they were told, the show has many plot points that will leave you in shock, and Nijima is a very dumb character so you can get a good laugh out of him, but apart form that nothing you can't get from any other show(an example would be Deku from My hero).Overall: Overall this show gives me many emotions like I said. If you want a show that is just kids being kids, watch Chuunibyou. If you want a show where people grow, watch Your Lie in April. If you want a show where people try to find out how they really feel, Watch Kokoro connect. But if you want a show where you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the ride, this is not too bad.Thanks for reading this! If you think i got anything wrong or if there is more that i can add to this lmk. Other than that this is Vibez signing off. See Ya! pretty good right? Well everything from that is downhill. I thought that from there the show would only get better and better, however half of the plot points that they introduce don't even have a solid conclusion. Even the main conflict with Nejima having to chose between Misaki and Sanada doesn't even get answered in the end. Overall the story was a mess.Characters: Most of the characters in this show are puppets. What I mean by this is that the characters feel like they have no life of their own. The characters do what they need to further the plot, and they are never talked about again. One example of this would be Shuu Igarashi. The moment Shuu was introduced into the show she seemed so interesting, and had so much promise. Even so, she was in one episode, and explained Misaki's love for Nejima(which we don't even know who Nejima chooses). When I saw this I thought it was a joke. A character that is related to the person who made the notices only gets 20 minutes of screentime for the whole show, and is only there to remind us, yeah Misaki likes Nejima. One of my favorite characters in the show was Nisaka, and that was only because of his growth throughout the show.Enjoyment: While I may say that the show was not what I expected story-wise, the show was decently enjoyable. I felt that the characters were just doing what they were told, the show has many plot points that will leave you in shock, and Nijima is a very dumb character so you can get a good laugh out of him, but apart form that nothing you can't get from any other show(an example would be Deku from My hero).Overall: Overall this show gives me many emotions like I said. If you want a show that is just kids being kids, watch Chuunibyou. If you want a show where people grow, watch Your Lie in April. If you want a show where people try to find out how they really feel, Watch Kokoro connect. But if you want a show where you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the ride, this is not too bad.Thanks for reading this! If you think i got anything wrong or if there is more that i can add to this lmk. Other than that this is Vibez signing off.

Misaki is just an average crybaby who loves the mc but is always very emotional. Ririka seemed like a good character until she said ""kiss...her everyday for ever"", she probably had feeligs for the MC but never relized she was going to marry him -_- in the future.side characters are TRASH the blond guy was there for 2 minutes was shown he had his wife they kissed an boom, one charcter off the script, second guy the gay guy who ALSO loved the mc never even told him his feelings he was literally the only sane character in this whole story but he had a trash ending also. At the end the mc was still leaning for Misaki and her only, ... then one day his mum wakes him that he has to go to the hotsprings with his assigned wife ,they have fun get distruped by the parents then the night scene they kissed said theyd lie for 6 mouth just for him to marry Misaki. last few mins they were trying the wedding costumes the the runs to them falls down like a total  c u n t and then he says he basically loves both of em . Over all he is very pridefull and selfish by not wanting to decide. WASTE OF TIME. the art is pretty well done for 2017.

I honeslty don't know why people expect a second season, since the director made up the last half of the last episode and sort of ties up the main characters plots (excluding one). But for a stand alone series, it's not horrible.Art: Art was great, it wasn't too kiddish...which was nice (even though it IS teenagers as the main characters), and matched the book nicely.Sound: The music and sound was great, great voice acting (I watched the subbed version, not dubbed) and I was pleased with it. No complaints.Character: All the characters were well written and a bit frustrating, but when you're 16 and in love, things don't make sense so I give it a pass.Overall, i enjoyed the series.

Right off the bat the premise is kind of unique and brings up an interesting question of whether predetermined love or self-discovered love is better.

The main character is a total pushover with no spine or commitment or ability to make decisions for himself, and constantly flip flops on what he wants.

This anime is overall good!', ""the rant: RIDICULOUS ! IRRATIONAL ! BULLSHIT ENDING ! SCAM OF THE CENTURY !the review, two days later: It's heartbreaking how poorly the story was received.There is absolutely no grace in the way Koi to Uso played its viewers for fools. It's ridiculous in a lot of ways; so ridiculous that it makes one believe it was done purposefully. Koi to Uso is an anime with good points, except there are numerous points that make it nearly unsalvageable. Masaru Yokoyama gives a distinct and emotional sound as in Kuzu no Honkai; points for that. Art is pleasant and delicate. Cinematography is immersive and only occasionally...unflattering. So far, so good. The eyes, however, are way overdone. While you do get used to it over time, Koi to Uso will remain that anime with the delicate art and unfortunately overdone eyes. Another problem hard to overlook is the voice casting. Kana Hanazawa is the only charming voice in the anime. The other voice actors, while not necessarily bad, are not on par with Kana Hanazawa. An unforgivable crime if you ask me.The story went places, it did; it was all over the fucking place. Every event and progression makes you wonder why exactly the story decided on what it did. Backstory and story proper, alike, could've gone differently. The ending was so rushed that its resolution felt pretentious. Not only did the story take a disagreeable turn, it did so vaguely and uncertainly. A lot is left unresolved. Any chance of justifying the characters' decisions was lost in the rush. The ending makes it impossible to have positive feelings for the anime as a whole. Koi to Uso isn't enjoyable, unless you're masochistic and/or into the irrational, which is only one way to look at it. The story certainly is cruel and insulting, but what it isn't, is shallow.The three comprising the love triangle have a peaceful (and mutualistic) dynamic. One truth threatens to disturb this dynamic, and so they ignore it. Before anything else, Koi to Uso is a romantic drama. It focuses on the characters and the romance between them; the setting merely the stage. It's amusing to keep track of the characters’ lies. In a world that bans the two acts, the characters love freely and lie just as easily. All the characters do is act impulsively, regret and justify everything they do, love by their definition, and lie. But every scene is a perfect picture of the emotion it intends to contain. Attraction. Desire. Denial. Confusion. Indecision. Guilt. Desperation. It’s beautiful.Lies are convenient. Believe in whatever will make you sleep better at night. The lie will eventually become the truth. It doesn’t matter if you agree with the show. Koi to Uso doesn’t intend to be agreeable as much as it intends to tell a messy, disastrous love story. Plain and simple. It’s an emotional experience you either ride with or dismiss with reason. As if we don’t all lose reason when we’re in love. It’s a good show to watch if you just want to feel something.Warning: MC's pathetic. One of the worst. His voice actor doing a good job just makes it worse. unflattering. So far, so good.

It heavily suffers from what I call “Nisekoi Syndrome”, a.k.a. I-don’t-know-how-to-write-satisfying-endings syndrome, and the story constantly derails from its promising premise of government-assigned marriages. However, it does do some things right. It’s got very refreshing art, and a captivating premise. If you’re looking for a classic shoujo-style story that jerks at your heartstrings, this one isn’t a bad series to watch.*Story and Characters*Koi to Uso has a simple premise. The setup is that the futuristic Japanese government can now arrange perfect marriages, and when you turn 16, you are given...a “notice” of who your partner will be. The main character, Nejima, is a teen boy that falls in love with someone other than his destined future wife. Shocker, right?If there’s one thing Koi to Uso does well, it’s utilizing dramatic irony. The viewer sees the story unfold from an omniscient perspective, and we get to track all the characters’ feelings that the main character does not see. This creates a very interesting tension between all the characters. It hints at the romantic feelings of the two female characters, Misaki and Ririna, and that of the main characters’ friend Nisaka. Many times, there’s this palpable tension between Nejima and his interactions with the rest of the cast.There’s some fanservice thrown in too. It fits in nicely with the tension.Other than that, though, the rest is mediocreSetting - While the show plays off the whole idea that the main character has been mismatched, there is no apparent danger in calling the engagement off, and the only thing stopping this main character from breaking off his engagement with his government-assigned wife is the lack of his own courage. Not only does this create a very weak-willed main character that is incredibly frustrating to swallow, this begs the viewers to ask, “Why even bother?”. For a show based off the premise of prearranged marriages, this show seems to really de-emphasize that aspect.Characters – The anime suffers from very bland characters. Nejima plays as your stereotypical clueless schoolboy in love, and Ririna and Misaki might as well be the same person with how they act all the time. We don’t get to know anything about Nisaka’s personality either. The cast is overall quite forgettable.Ending – *mild spoiler alert* Oh my goodness the ending. This show suffers from an extreme case of “Nisekoi Syndrome”, a.k.a. I’m-going-to-make-a-season-two-so-screw-you-viewers. Honestly, I feel very cheated. The whole show puts you in a constant guessing game of “Who is Nejima going to choose”, so you’d expect for him to perhaps just maybe actually choose someone?While there isn’t anything wrong with an open-ended ending per say, this just felt as if the author decided to rip the last 50 pages out of a novella and dumped it just so he could sell more copies of his sequel book.*Soundtrack and Art*First, the voice acting. The overall atmosphere was captured well by the voice actors, and while it wasn’t something extremely memorable, the voice acting did not get in the way of the story. If there’s one bone I had to pick, it’s that the characters sound the same from scene to scene, but that’s a matter of personal preference, so take my opinion as a grain of salt. The ending song is somewhat impactful, and I think that’s the one song I’ll take away from this series. Other than that, nothing too distasteful or too good either.The art is the most interesting part of this, and the one aspect of this anime that made me watch this series. It’s distinct and a bit strange, and sometimes the characters look a bit deformed, but it was eye-catching and memorable. It’s a refreshing style of art, a nice change of pace from the usual anime that we’re used to watching. If anything, the art was the best part of this anime.*Verdict*Coming from a person who really enjoys Nakige-style tearjerkers, I personally enjoyed Koi to Uso for what it was worth. Some of the scenes were very intense, and I couldn’t help but feel a bit of sympathy for the main character. The soundtrack and the voice acting were not distracting either.

Even though the story was dramatic and over-the-top it was an interesting concept and I enjoyed viewing a story exploring the line between passion and practicality in love and relationships. At the very end though, the story betrayed everything the show stood for about following your heart. If it wasn't for the last episode, the story would have an 8 and characters would have a 7. I didn't enjoy how flimsy the male protagonist was and how okay each girl was...about how indecisive he was. I truly enjoyed the story and the opening hooked me into the show.

That\'s just personal choice. interestingly, I really like the big eyes art style of Basilisk. Why score 8 then, you may ask. Throughout the series the art team as well as the voice actors worked incredibly well to add detail to the scenes. Go back and watch the climactic moments in this anime and...you\'ll notice incredible body language which adds so much values to those scenes. The tension and power both sound and art add to this anime is astounding.Character development:For me what shines about this anime is actually the characters. By the end of episode one I already cared deeply for the two main characters. The scene in the playground at the end of ep. 1 was incredible. I have never felt so many feels in only one episode before.I really liked that character of Ririna. She wasn\'t tsundere and she never made sexy jokes or acted over the top. It\'s actually really hard to make two female characters that aren\'t polar opposites of each other. I respect how they made both female leads actually very similar.I loved Misaki, of course mainly because I love Hanazawa Kana-san as a voice actress. I always fall for her characters (Kuroneko I\'m looking at you!!) But I also liked this character. She was well balanced and I didn\'t feel like there were too many ""fake anime moments"" with her, you see, I like realistic things to happen in the story and I appreciate it when dialogue and scripting reflects what a person might really do in that situation.I hated Yukari for nearly the entire time. It was only at the very last episode when he spoke about himself to Nisaka that I realised that although I might dislike him, it was their intention to make him that way- his character was just one I detest. Then again, had I have been in his situation.... I hated how apologetic and stammering he always was. I hated his stupid shocked face EVERY time one of the girls said something. GOD it was ANNOYING.Nisaka... well I can\'t say too much without spoiling the story. I( loved how the story developed his character, quite subtly. I did feel his character was ever so slightly generic, but every now and then there was a sparkle of nice narrative.Conclusion:Overall, interestingly, I ended up rooting for Ririna over Misaki, in spite of my bias.

(can hardly call that an ending)In the world of Koi to Uso, the government determines who your marriage partner will be, at the age of 16, taking many factors up to that point into account. Let\'s just take it as is and ignore that in a realistic approach, this would cause so many problems (revolts, love affairs, suicides, ...) that it would never work out as nicely as depicted in this show. So, if you are critical about the general setting a story plays in, that will most likely bother you a lot,...as they make it seem like nearly everybody is fine with this concept.Knowing the setting this story plays in, it\'s already pretty obvious what happens. Yukari loves Misaki, Misaki loves Yukari, but Yukari gets assigned to Ririna as marriage partner. As there are many possibilities how this could play out, depending on what type of person Ririna is, they went for the scenario where Ririna falls for Yukari too, and even befriending Misaki. This turns this whole story into an emotional dilemma, rather than a ""fight against the system"" kind of thing.Sadly, I was very disappointed with the ending. The dilemma built up throughout the show makes it obvious that no way how Yukari chooses, a person important to him (and himself too) will get hurt, so I was looking forward to see how they make it play out... just to see that they don\'t conclude anything in the end. It\'s absolutely unclear whether or not he will obey the system, fight against it, or whatever. as they make it seem like nearly everybody is fine with this concept.Knowing the setting this story plays in, it\'s already pretty obvious what happens.

I cannot express the level of disappointment after witnessing it, honestly.The premise is actually pretty solid and original, the setting is realistic and had potential, and you even get characters with honest motivations (get to stay with the person they love) and that would do anything to accomplish that... except they didn\'t, or even managed to AT LEAST set a...course of action to accomplish that. The childhood love interest kind of doesn\'t want to let go the MC, but she kinda wants to; the assigned wife, suddenly loves the MC but decides not to in the end because she became very good friends with the former one BUT STILL kind of wants to be with him; the surprise and unsuspected third person in this love square appears but says ""screw this"" and just gives up in the end; and the bland, generic main character decides to make the LAZIEST and CHEAPEST choice for a romance series I\'ve seen in an ending. I actually realized I wasted 12 weeks of my life waiting eagerly for a closure (or at least an open ending for future seasons) and got nothing. You just don\'t do that. Not even if an anime is trying to advertise a manga or a light novel. You\'ll hurt the source material BADLY.Not only that, but at some point some plot elements I even gave the benefit of the doubt turned out to be absolutely unrealistic. Yes, I\'m talking about the goddamn eraser (not spoiling it, but if you ever watch this you\'ll see). Some characters just appear for the sake of the plot and we never get to see or hear about them again. But what infuriates me the most is the fact that the premise is absolutely WASTED into teenage insecurity and angst. Yes, the main cast somewhat manages to be better people after meeting each other, but even so it feels like all of that meant nothing in the end. They could have fought for a change, they could have gone against the system and shown that even with adversity they\'d fight for their ideals, they could have even faced the worst of the worst and been disowned by their families just to be true to their feelings but... but no. They sort of just go with it and never question the system. I honestly don\'t know how the manga managed to keep it up after where the anime left the story (which was an original ending for the series, and because of that, it made things worse), but if making such a bad writing decision for the ending so people could check out the manga instead was their plan from the beginning, they succeeded then.I insist, if we even got an open ending for a season 2 or an actual, plausible choice for the love interest in the ending, even if it went against the source material, that\'d have been THOUSANDS of times better than the garbage we got in the end.I\'d recommend either reading the manga or not checking the anime at all.

From the middle to the very end, it was very questionable what will happen in the end. The conclusion of the story is disappointing. The art style was good. The music was good at certain climax parts. The main character was pretty common and cringy like many animes. Somewhat interesting square love story if I can say. I really rooted for Ririna in this mess. The Pure-hearted should always be in the first place. As for the other girl, I think she is at her own fault, not persisting hard enough with what she loved all of her life. ', 'While the concept of fighting for your love in a setting where the government decides your partner once you turn 16 is somewhat intriguing, it is unfortunately based on ideas that are largely idiotic and childish (which can also be said about most of the plot) that fall flat if you think about it just a little. The plot does seem like something that a 12 year old girl conjured up for a short story homework (even though this show does appeal to the male fantasy more than anything).Long story short, Japan implementing those regulations in the first place is ridiculous. I know we...need a big love-related problem forced upon our characters that they need to fight, but there are obvious issues with that concept that are, unsurprisingly, literally the main storyline of this show - people might have other stuff going on and won\'t just easily accept it. The show tells you that this plan worked wonders, promoted lasting marriages and better offspring, but if you think about it in reality, even the North Korean government would probably realize that it would be a shitshow. And I\'m not saying it\'s entirely unrealistic that the government might become totalitarian in that sense, after all what else can the people do except obey. But the problem is that, at the same time, the rest of the lifestyle in Japan seems to stay the same and it is a bit unbelievable that their government would have done this. They even mention the possibility of getting a divorce, which renders the whole law a bit pointless aside from merely recommending a partner to you, but since I\'m a little confused about that and haven\'t watched enough, I\'ll give it a pass.So the literal intrigue of the show seems a little forced and far-fetched. It\'s also probably a little childish to make the Koi to Uso universe revolve so much around love, and making it seem like such a big deal that decides everyone\'s lives more than a career and anything else (although obviously marriage is one of the most important things). I am aware that it\'s a romance show in a school setting, but still.Beyond that, practically everything that happens is either pretty damn ridiculous for me or just very awkward, and the characters aren\'t much better.Firstly, the love story between the first 2 people. The acts of romance are cute, but beyond that, it\'s just as believable, or special, as any other romance in anime or live-action. Which is not much. Neji says he has literally only spoken to her once in 5 years. I can relate to some extent to such a crush where you build an idealistic picture based on their looks but like... you have no clue what she\'s like. Come on man, at least 2 phrases. Otherwise it\'s just simping for her looks and nothing more.The even worse part is that she somehow likes him back because of things like he ""plucked up the courage to talk to her"", was nice and gave her his rubber, and of course the other nonsense like she likes his hair at the back or whatever. Unfortunately that is very unrealistic, especially for someone with her looks. Sorry not sorry but as much as I like anime as a medium to dream about things like this, there is simply no substance to what\'s going on here.It doesn\'t help that the guy is as he is - so weak and feminine. Jesus christ. Without any exaggeration, I only laughed at this show sometimes out of pity for how pathetic and shy he was. I\'m all for being a nice guy but I find it hard to believe he would get that sort of reception from boys and girls alike whilst having so little personality. Not only him but several characters are plagued by the show\'s attempts at making them cute and shy. Sorry but like... making a couple ""cute"" teens blush like that all the time and act embarrassed won\'t create a wholesome vibe for me, more like a not-this-again vibe. There\'s too few important characters that act... normal. This show makes 16 year olds act like 12 year olds and even then it gets it wrong since even they have something to them aside from acting cute all the time.Speaking of comedy, the jokes are so stupid, childish, not to mention such unoriginal tropes that it\'s nearly an insult to the viewer. Specifically, characters\' exaggerated reactions and the ""Ririna is provocatively dressed and doesn\'t realise it"" thing that was done not once but twice in the span of 2 episodes. What 16 year old girl on this Earth is half naked with a guy in the room and doesn\'t realize it only to create some classic embarrassment humor? The writing is at a level where I don\'t even feel compelled to yap about it anymore, just... be disappointed in silence.Ririna\'s whole character and wanting to learn about love so much that she literally instructs the guy to kiss the other girl all the time, wants to hear about their love all the time and watch it, is beyond ridiculous. It\'s pathetic male fantasy. She is SIXTEEN, not 9.Aside from the ridiculous plot the characters are involved in and that shapes who they are to us, they don\'t have much depth, personal issues or differences worth thinking about.For a while, honestly I was wondering where it would go as far as the main storyline goes. The fight for love, basically, is the interesting part. So I kept going. But I no longer wonder about that, taking all of these flaws into account and eventually the dynamic that it went into in episode 3 (Ririna weirdly pushing their romance + it seems there\'ll be some drama about Nisaka and the girl - I\'m predicting they were either assigned to each other or he liked her but who knows). Seeing the quality of the writing and some of its intentions it doesn\'t seem like there\'ll be much more of substance and I\'ve no clue where it wants to go from here.In the beginning I thought the art style was rather unique but relatively unsettling or even off-putting. I got used to it quickly though so no big deal.Oh yeah, and those government people coming to Neji... at midnight... in the park... to give him the official document concerning his assigned partner... was also... how do I put this... a pathetically ridiculous idea no adult should ever conjure up? Whats wrong with this writer?Overall, the style, the jokes, the plot, the characters, are all pretty childish if not ridiculous. I didn\'t necessarily cringe, nor did I ever roll my eyes as I often do watching stuff like this, I just simply... had to laugh... at how pitiful some things are. And still it\'s more interesting than the average anime hence the rating. Yikes. need a big love-related problem forced upon our characters that they need to fight, but there are obvious issues with that concept that are, unsurprisingly, literally the main storyline of this show - people might have other stuff going on and won\'t just easily accept it.

The writing is at a level where I don\'t even feel compelled to yap about it anymore, just... be disappointed in silence.Ririna\'s whole character and wanting to learn about love so much that she literally instructs the guy to kiss the other girl all the time, wants to hear about their love all the time and watch it, is beyond ridiculous. It\'s pathetic male fantasy. She is SIXTEEN, not 9.Aside from the ridiculous plot the characters are involved in and that shapes who they are to us, they don\'t have much depth, personal issues or differences worth thinking about.For a while, honestly I was wondering where it would go as far as the main storyline goes. The fight for love, basically, is the interesting part. So I kept going. But I no longer wonder about that, taking all of these flaws into account and eventually the dynamic that it went into in episode 3 (Ririna weirdly pushing their romance + it seems there\'ll be some drama about Nisaka and the girl - I\'m predicting they were either assigned to each other or he liked her but who knows). Seeing the quality of the writing and some of its intentions it doesn\'t seem like there\'ll be much more of substance and I\'ve no clue where it wants to go from here.In the beginning I thought the art style was rather unique but relatively unsettling or even off-putting. I got used to it quickly though so no big deal.Oh yeah, and those government people coming to Neji... at midnight... in the park... to give him the official document concerning his assigned partner... was also... how do I put this... a pathetically ridiculous idea no adult should ever conjure up? Whats wrong with this writer?Overall, the style, the jokes, the plot, the characters, are all pretty childish if not ridiculous. I didn\'t necessarily cringe, nor did I ever roll my eyes as I often do watching stuff like this, I just simply... had to laugh... at how pitiful some things are. And still it\'s more interesting than the average anime hence the rating. Yikes.', ""Manga is much better!Maybe i would rate it different if i wouldn't read manga first, but then i would never watch this anime, because i usually watch just high rated anime. So here are my issues with anime:1. Lots of events missing from manga. I would expect opposite, to add some events or at least extend scenes from manga (where you somehow imagine how it plays out), but here everything is very lacking. So if i wouldn't know story from manga, i would be even less satisfied as i am now.2. Character looks are different, less pretty than in manga. Misaki from manga might be...prettiest girl character from manga/anime i ever saw, but in this anime they disgraced her look, so its really a big letdown. Also for Yukari which should be average look, its another letdown. In manga he looks cool, but here its just too much on the side of ugly. But more than that, its too different so that must be bothering me.3. Voices of Misaki and Yukari are not convincing, actually they are a bit annoying. I totally didn't imagine them to sound like that. So again my experience of anime is quite bad in this regard.4. Character behaviour, Yukari the most, is annoying. Like He would be 12 years old, and not 16. It doesn't reflect what would i expect. If you compare Love is war anime, there is a big comedy and a big drama. Characters are portrayed as serious, despite lot of funny scenes. But here there isn't much mature behaviour, very childish and in a bad way.So overall i can't rate it even with middle score (5) but just 4/10. Manga is really much better, for me its amazing. All the details that are lost here, feeling that it gives me... All is lost here, unfortunately. prettiest girl character from manga/anime i ever saw, but in this anime they disgraced her look, so its really a big letdown.

The MC is a spineless guy who had been harbouring feelings for a girl in his class since he was young. He keeps it hidden and doesn't say this to anyone including the girl until the day before he turns 16, to his surprise she had been in love with him for all these years too. However, in this world everyone gets a notice for their scientifically chosen partners at the age of 16. His notice arrives and it is not her, but someone else. He tells...her about the first girl and as she has never experienced love before, she decides to support his relationship. Soon we see them get into a situationship where they like each other but at the same time care and love the other girl more. At the same time, we are shown that the MCs male best friend is closeted and also in love with him. The anime just loops this totally ordinary MC playing around with the feelings of everyone around him with no idea what he is doing. A cliché of sorts and somewhat terrible to watch.

But slowly turns into a repetitive and also a vicious circle of weird romance that actually is a well done representation of young love, but it turns that it's in a constant state of doing the things over and over at a point that you may be annoyed by the characters. The story itself is not that good, but when you continue it in the manga, it gets a lot more better. Also, the soundtrack goes...along with the show so good, the opening catches the main intention of the plot. The opening by Frederic uses some dynamics in the song that helps a lot to give more drama from the very beginning. along with the show so good, the opening catches the main intention of the plot.

Every single second when I hoped for a redemption arc and for the protag to stop being a pussy and actually choose a girl I would always be disappointed. And the worst thing is that the premise of the story is actually very interesting and has a ton of potential yet the author failed to treat it like a drama-romcom but rather than a harem. Admittedly I like harem, but the synopsis made it painfully obvious that this story was supposed...to have only one heroine at the end and having that thought in mind, I cannot help but scream in agony after every episode where they would reinforce stupid situations where both girls have to lewd the MC or some shit making this already stupid and indecisive dude the more hesitant to choose. I don't even remember his name that's how forgettable and despicable the protag is he should have been in a damn hentai not a romcom. I know the manga MAY redeem this landfilll of an anime but I don't have much hope considering this guy literally two-timed his childhood friend whilst knowing it is absolutely impossible and illegal. When I watched infinite stratos I thought that Orimura was the worst and most boring ass MC out there but boy I was wrong this guy transcended the limit of garbage protagonists. I guess I enjoyed the waifus they were fine but my condolences that they have to date such a horrendous MC. The only decent and actually realistic character I found slightly likeable was Nisaka this dude acknowledged the fact that polygamy is impossible and tried to tell the MC but man even an adamantium drill can't get anywhere close to this dude's density and stupidity.

The main character of this anime has many worries and thoughts, but actually his personality makes me quite hate him. But as for the main plot developments, it\'s actually quite fascinating.

So I promised myself that I will stick \'till the end. And I was disappointed. It may contain some spoilers but in my opinion, it wasn\'t a big secret anyway.Let\'s start with the story. The story is really basic. When you are 16 years old, the Japanese government assign you a partner. And we really don\'t see a development in the story. It was just two people loved each other but they didn\'t assign to each other. But, of course, it had love square. The assigned partners started to...developed some feelings for each other (of course, it had to be) and there is a guy which was only there to make fujoshis happy. And, yeah. That was basically it. Well, at first I was guessing that they will go against the government or destroy the system. But well... And the ending was ridiculous. I understand the effort to make everybody happy in the end but I thought it ended uncompleted and rushed.Which brings me to the characters. I didn\'t like the characters. Nisaka was my favorite in the series but he was actually extra. We didn\'t learn why he likes Nisaka, what has happened to him etc. He was just there to be there. We have almost no information about him. Misaka and Ririna... Oh, boy. Where should I start? So, I really didn\'t like the fact that both of them willing to the everything to make the other person happy. Even it costs their happiness. Which was unrealistic. The whole series was ""No, you should be with Nejima."" ""No, YOU should be with Nejima."" Which was weird. It was hard to watch. Because you expect to see some fight in order to get the one you love so much. But they were willing to give the other person happiness even though they really don\'t know each other really well. And then Nejima. He is awful. He was so average that even an average person wouldn\'t be like him. Actually, I really didn\'t understand why they love him. Yeah, he is nice but he has nothing interesting besides that. Now, I don\'t mean that in order to a person be interesting, the person has to have some cool talents or some cool personality. But he talks boring, he acts boring. He is just plain boring. He is really average. Which makes the situation worse because you started to think that he cast a spell or something. And at the end, he the ""choice"" that he made was ridiculous.It was a cliche love-story. I don\'t really recommend this anime because it really didn\'t add something. The characters and the story were superficial and unoriginal. It was not particularly boring but it didn\'t give me some feelings. I watched it, I slightly regret it but it wasn\'t so awful.

As a person that comes from a background where arranged marriages are common and love marriages are to be more looked down upon, but growing up in a society where the opposite is true, this dilemma really seemed interesting to me.One part that I liked was how the author went into depth on, how...many crushes are formed and how feelings develop in unconventional means that are really hard to convoy. Like when Nejima was asked if he fell in love with Takasaki when he gave her the other half of the easer or did he do that before he was in love. This story does very little things correctly but the things it did I really enjoyed. Like how romeo and julet was used as an play and still very popular even with this system in place. Just like how in bollywood movies they fantasize about love even when most marriages are arraigned. Also on how it tried to go in depth on when the feelings of love are devolved. I also understood why the system was so effective as seen in south Asian countries.Tldr;10/10 Enjoyment I love dumpster firespremise was interestingexecution was awful many crushes are formed and how feelings develop in unconventional means that are really hard to convoy.

I also understood why the system was so effective as seen in south Asian countries.Tldr;10/10 Enjoyment I love dumpster firespremise was interestingexecution was awful', 'i thought Koi to Uso is an anime with lots of drama and romance people who enjoy drama would like this anime. As for the characters I feel like some of the characters had a good development. But the one charcter I feel good have a had a little more development was Nisaka. In this kind of anime I think its good for the male protagonist to have a friend who is a boy.The art i think was really good im not surprised though it is 2020 so i say good good for whoever did the art for the anime.as for the sound and intro...and outro and instrumental music that is played for certain scenes i feel like it was good not the best but goodto finish off my review im gonna say i enjoyed watching this anime. i have a suggestion for an anime similar to this its called bokura ga ita.to whoever views my review i hope you enjoy it! its the review i have written on myanimelisthave a nice to day to whoever reads this review and outro and instrumental music that is played for certain scenes i feel like it was good not the best but goodto finish off my review im gonna say i enjoyed watching this anime. i have a suggestion for an anime similar to this its called bokura ga ita.to whoever views my review i hope you enjoy it! its the review i have written on myanimelisthave a nice to day to whoever reads this review', ""May include spoilers:The way the plot is played out is nicely done. With Neiji having to chose between adolescent love, and the potential love of his life. However, the character development lacks so much, it makes the experience disappointing. Neijis only defining characteristic is that he's indecisive and loves burial mounds. Misaka, while I did root for her in the beginning, I didnt at the end. Her character became unlikable for me and I dont understand how.As for Nisaka, I felt, was heavily underdeveloped. He had so much potential and not enough screen time. I feel like the plot between Neiji and Nisaka could...have gone deeper. Nisaka from the audience's perspective has feelings for Neiji, but instead of pushing them onto Neiji, Nisaka instead helps Neiji and his shitty love life decisions.The only character I felt had the most growth was Ririna. She was antisocial and had a hard time making friends, but in the end she ended up with great friends at school, and trying her hardest to make the people she loves get together even if she gets hurt.The ending: if the setting were in a place where poly relationships existed, I would have been content. However, that's not what's happening. The way the story goes it feels like Neiji MUST choose who he wants(but like I said hes an indecisive little shit).I was also put off by the art style, but that's just a personal preference.

Because of this, I do have a soft spot for love & lies. HOWEVER, that does not excuse the absolute SHITSHOW that this anime is. I wanted this to at the very least be a guilty pleasure so bad but I legit had to drop episode 8 midway through because of the absolute cringefest this was. I gave this an 8/10 first watch through but that dropped to a 5/10. My reason for this is while it is...undoubtedly terrible there was a certain aspect I enjoyed. The yaoi. I\'ve never been a big fan of the yaoi genre (probably never will) but I did enjoy the relationship Yukari had with Nisaka and found it pretty wholesome in fact. If you had ANY reason to want to watch this it would be for that reason SOLELY (still not enough IMO). All said and done this is not worth your time and you\'re better off watching SAO 3 times. undoubtedly terrible there was a certain aspect I enjoyed. The yaoi.

It has a very bright but warm melody. Its lyrics is also very apt to the story. And as a song, I’ve seen reviewers say that it would even be their wedding theme, which I totally understand why. I would unashamedly sing along but the Japanese lyrics are difficult and sang also quickly, so too bad for non-Japanese-speaking me.I don’t why I watched this anime as I hate love triangle romances.

I know that 1, 2 or all 3 persons involved will surely get hurt. Aren’t there enough people in the world that someone can find their true love who in turn loves them back?

It’s a crazy premise but of course, it’s an anime.SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW BELOWIndecision or procrastination are easily done by many when faced with difficult situations since maybe the problem will hopefully resolve itself. I’ve done it, more I wanted to. IMO, the MC should have decided right at the beginning to choose one of the girls immediately. Delaying the decision to perhaps have a better-informed choice for one, unnecessarily drags several 3rd parties into the mess. I know it was a no-win impossible scenario, which is all the more painful since hearts are involved.To me, this is a bad story wherein the male MC goes throughout the whole being indecisive and then the ending is that he wants them both??? I empathize/identify with the male MC since he was neither ugly nor handsome and neither exceptionally smart nor skilled at anything of consequence. Kind of like me, he was an insignificant individual, hardly noticed by anyone and just drifting thru life. Then, he hit the jackpot. However, it seemed to me that, in a sense, he became arrogant/greedy. Sure, there are other factors involved but disappointingly, he did not fight.Here’s my 2-cents on the best solution. Upon meeting Riri, Neji should have told her that they were not to see each other or get to know each other for maybe 6 months. They will pretend and/or fool everyone that they were calling each other on the phone and maybe even going on weekly dates (but not actually). In the meantime, Neji & Taka will “date” as much as they can (incognito of course) to determine if their love is real and worth fighting for and if their love merits the negative societal repercussions that will come if they continue. Riri is very very very nice. Neji & Taka look very well matched though. Neji & Taka have watched/known/loved each other for several years. The “split eraser” memento is classic so how can you top that? I point out also that Riri does not get to know Neji in this plan so she does not fall for Neji and does not get hurt. It is my (foolhardy?) desire that love blossom without casualties. watching an anime type I do not particular enjoy. I know that 1, 2 or all 3 persons involved will surely get hurt.

The OST is really good. From then on a new fmc was introduced and she showed signs of zero interest but was extremely supportive for the mc\'s love (which felt good). Then the friend of mc was shown as a rival but he did a complete 180 which also was fine since he didn\'t try to break off mc\'s relationship. Then there came...along few other characters who added to the plot. I thought the story was going good and just like that they started making weird choices which (seemed for me), turned that simple plot around and added almost nothing towards clarifying the characters\' feelings or decisions. And this is a bit off topic but, the fact that Misaki hid something from both Nejima and the other fmc still kinda bugs me (She was also discussing something with the other guy). and a clarity on the message he received at the time of his proposal also wasn\'t clarified properly and the white-haired friend (igarashi ig) knows something and hid it. I expected a proper closure for this story which i didn\'t get. Atleast a proper explanation for the events would have been nice. I felt sad because of the fact that it ended just like that and no proper end was given in the ""anime"" for the so-called 5 year love and government selected partner\'s love. (She never told him that she loved him tho.) I\'ll read the manga. Though I don\'t expect anything or get my hopes up. Misaki x Nejima go!I gave this rating for the following things:first episode and the romance between Misaki and Nejima and the ""friendship"" of Ririna with the other two and the character of Nisaka and of course, The OST. along few other characters who added to the plot.

Unfortunately, the story took a turn for the worse after each and every damn episode. I will say that the drama was very interesting at first, but that got old quick, and the ending was nonetheless very mediocre.

The reason for this system is the poor natality Japan is facing, a way Japanese politics believe that is the correct to solve the problem.Our protagonist, Nejima, deeply loves his old classmate, Misaki, and he is decided to confess his love to her before receiving the news about his future wife. He is conscious...about the small possibility of ending up with his childhood love forever and invites Misaki to meet him later. After an incomprehensible delay, the girl finally meets with Nejima and both express their mutual feelings. But, being a drama, when the feelings were already confessed, Nejima receives the news about his selected wife, and, of course, he ended up with another girl. Misaki cries and runs away after the government’s message, trying to accept their future.After this, the anime turns himself into a completely and giant mess. Nejima’s wife is introduced, Ririna, a totally boring and innocent girl who encourages Nejima to cheat on her with Misaki. This is how the author of the story develops the love triangle: Nejima and Misaki are trying to face the reality ignoring the feelings for each other, and Ririna pretends to be the Cupid and allows her future husband to cheat on her... This ends up with a terrible romance, with exaggerated scenes and no real feelings. Some episodes passed and the anime tell us that there is a way for the two lovebirds to end up together, something easy never considered by the characters.This series is mediocre. A lot of information is forgotten by the characters, some points are never explored, even if they have the potential to be really good, and the best boy of the series, Nisaka, is completely ignored over two idiot and boring girls. The episodes are full of nothing! Nothing! It is like these kids have no IQ and cannot decide for themselves. For example, if you really love a girl that much, like you are constantly saying, what is the problem for you to try to stay with her?

The antithesis of satisfying. I understand why it is rated so poorly for many reasons, but this is the largest for me by far. The lack of any real substance to the anime justifies the poor score alone. The only real aspect of the show that has substance was the clearly unrequited and never broached love between the MCs male friend and himself. ', 'STORY (3/10)A simple ""we like this person but we\'re unable to decide how it plays out"" story... which is a huge disappointment as, instead of giving us actual chances to see who\'d be the better match, we\'re given an open-ended conclusion.By the way, if you\'re interested if this deals with *anything* regarding a healthy, stable marriage foundation... don\'t get your hopes up, not even a spark - you will NOT deal with that in this show.ART (7/10)For the most-part, the animation\'s consistent with a few more obvious errors you tend to see. I\'m not a fan of the eyes, but it...was nice to see everyone\'s model remain consistent.SOUND (10/10)The music was nice and well utilized. The theme songs were both lovely and were more to my taste than I usually deal with.CHARACTER (6/10)They all have their standing and that remained consistent, but due to the inability for the author(s) to decide the end result, they kept going in circles.

The closer to the end I neared, the more I realized they were gonna have a cop-out.

Weak!', ""This anime is not that bad but is not that good either.The premise is japan trying to combat a low birth rate by using 'science' to force couples that will, with science, be statistically more likely to work out and be compatible. One thing to note is this anime is slightly ecchi. Now, it is not that bad and isn't used every scene, we're still able to enjoy the main plot.-sexuality-It might be because of the 'ecchi' nature of this anime, but surprisingly the subject of sexuality is talked about in a few scenes. Usually in japanese shows unless they're full-on ecchi sexuality is...talked about to further the fan-service. Now there is fan service here and there but sexuality is a must-have when the subject of the anime is japan in a low birth-rate. Here, in the west, we do not mind talking about it, and whenever japan mentions sex in an anime we call it fan-service. I just hoped they would've done it in a better manner than to use it to transition into an ecchi scene. A low birth-rate is indeed a problem, and the subject is 'taboo' and not really talked about as much as it is here so it would've been nice to have some decent points made or some subjects covered since we're talking about a low birth-rate japan.-The characters-The characters are pretty good, we all have expectations when it comes to characters in a romance anime but I still found those original. We can't expect every anime to re-invent the wheel every time, and so a lot of people blame poor writing or design but fact is animes would not work if they tried that. I think what they go through and how they express themselves fits characters in that situation which is one thing to look forward to in a romance anime. They have unique personalities and we understand they all want something different and we can tell a lot by the way they act rather than the way they tell us. 'show don't tell'-The plot-Now this is why this anime I would most likely not recommend. I like everything about it, almost, but the plot where we try to build around the 'lies' is where it loses me. The lies, what are they ? Well, if you're like me and have an IQ above room temperature, you try to think about it while watching it. What could the lie be ? We are waiting for an amazing plot twist at the end, something that will blow our minds. Nothing of the sorts will happen, the 'lies' are, in the end, very basic. So anyone expecting a bit plot reveal at the end finds themselves left in the dust. It could be that there would be bigger plot twists in the manga, but as I'm only reviewing the anime, it is a letdown. The easiest way to enjoy this anime is to not build expectations in the end.Not only that, but the way they end it is unconventional too. Now if it was about polyamory, this anime would be good. But the approach does not seem to talk about marginalized type of relationships. This seems to me to fall a bit more in the male relationship fantasy. I do not mind that it is, I do not think it's a problem, but it's a let-down from the whole build-up of plot tension. We end up thinking 'ah, so that's what it's about...'.in the end, mixed feelings.

There were so many moments of the show where I wanted to drop it. But I didn\'t only because I wanted to finish it because I am not gonna lie there were moments where I was hopeful that it will  at-least end decently. But I was highly disappointed.Characters were very bland. My least favorite male protagonist- right out of a harem show. Wimpy, undecided, no courage, little high school boy. Then, there is the ""beautiful cool mysterious black hair girl"" and the beautiful tsundere...pink haired girl. Hated all of the characters. Not one of them had any redeeming qualities.The story have hints that one of the characters was ""hiding something"" honestly I thought the end will shed some light on it but it didn\'t. Nor did it show anything about the 2 sub plots the whole series was hinting at. And the end was the worst one I have seen in anime by far. I am a big disliker for harem shows but I think this show even beats those harems. Overall, in my experience this is the worst I have seen pink haired girl. Hated all of the characters.

Despite the beautiful art and soundtrack, this show cannot rescue itself from the unrealistic cringe-fest that it is.Story: The idea behind the show is an interesting one. A world in which the government finds love for you has great romcom or romdram possibilities, and frankly would be a welcome change to my own life. Seriously dating is hard. For our protagonist, a timid, average across the...board nobody that spent an entire day debating whether or not to help someone, this guarantee of marriage should be a godsend. Unfortunately our boy thinks he can bat way above his league, and rejects this easy answer in favor of true love...until he learns that his assigned wife is hot. I felt personally offended multiple times at the sheer absurdity of the people interested in the protagonist because he proved time and time again that he did not deserve it.Art: The art is beautiful. Along with the soundtrack, these two are what prevents this from being a complete dumpster fire.Sound: The music is captivating, and helps to mitigate my rage at the actual going-ons of the show. The voice actors are pretty standard, though the actor playing the protagonist does an excellent job of making him as hateable as possible, which I can only assume to be a conscious upon hearing the lines he is made to say.Character: This is where it all comes crashing down. The girls are treated like blow up sex dolls that get wet at the slightest hint of basic human kindness from our protagonist. And our protagonist wants to have his cake and eat it too while refusing to accept any sort of personal responsibility for his actions. **Spoiler** In one scene he forces himself on a character and has the audacity to say he did it for her sake. Not cool anime, never cool. **End Spoiler**Enjoyment: Despite the god awful characters and plot, this anime has some fun moments away from the romance side of things. Those moments are few and far in between, but they helped me get through the show.Overall: If you want a romantic drama and are only half willing to pay attention, this show is good to have in the background. For anything more than that, I suggest looking elsewhere cause the curtain runs thin with this one, and if you bother to pay attention for five minutes you'll see the author furiously inserting himself to fulfill some childhood fantasy. board nobody that spent an entire day debating whether or not to help someone, this guarantee of marriage should be a godsend.

It has a manga and it\'s possible that it is better.Story (5): The story actually had an interesting set up. However, call me pragmatic all you\'d like; I did not sympathize with the plot. One of the main reasons I feel this way is because of the age and situation. So 2 VERY young teenagers are supposedly madly in love with one another even though they haven\'t talked since elementary school. One teen gets their assigned partner notice and is willing to give up a whole future with a good candidate for someone he doesn\'t truly know. Tbh, looking at...it, no matter which partner he picked, our protagonist, Yukari, would \'ve still ended up with a hot acquaintance and would have an equal chance of regretting the decision. The only difference is that one decision comes with major cons, which kinda makes the right decision stand out when you use logic. Thus; I didn\'t really care which girl he picked. The only reason I stuck with the show was because I prefer to finish my anime and there was a subplot that caught my attention. It was utterly disappointing when the ending was indecisive and the only interesting story was tossed away. It might have been a more interesting situation if the partners weren\'t assigned during the pinnacle of puberty and the first 2 lovers actually dated rather than expressing their ""love"" the night before a notice.Art (4): Although a lot of the scenes and settings were drawn beautifully, I could NOT get over the exaggerated character drawings. Although the art pretty much matches that of its source, it was really hard to overlook the un-proportional eyes and lips the size of a grape. That is the design for a majority of anime, but this one took it to a level it did not need to be on and certain scenes, like intense make out scenes were hard to watch. Not to mention it gave all the male characters feminine features.Sound (7): The opening was average and the ending song wasn\'t too bad and catchy, but not something I\'d care to remember. For the most part, the soundtrack wasn\'t distracting yet didn\'t necessarily stand out so I\'d say that\'s good.Characters (6): I feel like besides one, all the other major characters were rather unrealistic. Yes, there is NO real assigned partner system in Japan, but besides that, the anime seemed to want to capture a realistic idea for Japanese teens. Therefore, it was hard for me to believe a beautiful, and tiny girl at the top of her class was truly friendless for so long (and the reason they gave wasn\'t adequate enough). A lot of the decisions the characters made were rather stupid, illogical, and detrimental to the other parties involved, and they decided to cover these dumb choices up with a ""just cuz"" or ""love can do crazy things"" reason which got old. And finally, back to what I said earlier, there was only one character who actually sounded/acted like a normal person AND had a character plot that stunned almost all the viewers (and kept me tuning in) and it was disappointing when this person was tossed to the side.Enjoyment (7): Although it may seem rather hypocritical I had a decent time watching the show. Although I disliked the 3 main characters, I was rather interested in all the stories going on around the main plot. And I favored a certain character who made certain situations rather hysterical. it, no matter which partner he picked, our protagonist, Yukari, would \'ve still ended up with a hot acquaintance and would have an equal chance of regretting the decision.

Pokemon: Senritsu no Mirage Pokemon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1527/Pokemon__Senritsu_no_Mirage_Pokemon,"[""April 29th, 2006, is the day that lives in infamy in the Pokémon fandom. Kids' WB's promo(s) and the official Pokémon website hyped the “Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon” special up for the 10th anniversary, showing fan favorites such as Misty, Mewtwo, Entei, and Mew, and it was specially created for the fans—so much so, it was first aired overseas months before Japan got to see it. It was the first of its kind. But they were careful not to have actual audio playing from the special itself.Ten years may have passed since it was first released, however, the controversy is still felt among Pokémon fans...to this very day, despite the fact the officially-available dub is what features the current cast, not the place-holders in the original. (The special was Sarah Natochenny's first time voicing Ash before she premiered in Battle Frontier, but she also got her share of negativity at the time.) Upon rewatch years after the scars have healed over, there's more to the special that deserves criticism than the voice actors who were just paid to read off the script.STORY: Ash Ketchum and friends were invited via letters to get a first look at Dr. Yung's newest invention that would create Pokémon with unlimited strength through a mirage battle system. While marveling in awe at how “real” and strong the mirage Pokémon were during one such friendly battle, the machine went haywire and Dr. Yung was kidnapped by a masked man who went by the name “Mirage Master”, even kidnapping Professor Oak in the process to get him to have access to his research so he could create the perfect Pokémon resistant to all types and use it to—you guessed it—take over the world... maybe? But much to his annoyance, a Mew is there to foil his plans alongside Ash and Pikachu—and the others as they learn the secrets of the mirage system and the masked man. Or just the secret of the masked man, since the mirage system doesn't get touched on much outside of “It makes strong Pokémon!”The special has a message that all life has purpose in the world, regardless if they're natural or mirage, and thus aren't “defects”. If this sounds familiar, that's because it is. The special takes cues from “Mewtwo Strikes Back”, which is funny because a mirage Mewtwo was exactly what the mastermind was looking for. But how'd he get this information? From Pikachu's memories.But wait a minute, didn't Mewtwo erase those memories? He did, supposedly. Was there stock footage from the movie? Not the first one (because again, Mewtwo “erased” those memories), but from “Pokémon 2000” to “Heroes”, yes, and it's possible he saw memories up to the then-latest “Lucario and the Mystery of Mew”. Wasn't there stock footage of “Mewtwo Returns”, though? No, because TV specials don't count in a TV special. Maybe that's where he got the information from, but the special waves that away, so we don't get an explicit answer as to how he learned about Mewtwo. If it was to keep it a “plot twist”, unfortunately, that was its biggest selling point, so it probably would've been better to show “memory” footage of Mewtwo.But that's just one of many problems in this 40-minute special when you start using your brain. Not surprising that a Pokémon special can't battle its way out of a narrative paper bag. This is fan-pandering at its finest, seven years before “Pokémon Origins” came to trump it (which was later then usurped by “Hoopa and the Clash of Ages”, but whatever).CHARACTERS: What can be said that hasn't already been said? Ash is Ash. May is May. Brock is Brock (though he's missing from the majority of the special anyway). Team Rocket is Team Rocket. Even Misty is Misty, except it's like she didn't change from Johto minus Togepi and it was the last time she appeared in the anime—what a send off. I'd talk about Dr. Yung, except it's unfortunate he got kidnapped like five minutes after his introduction because there's not much to talk about. The trope “walking spoiler” perfectly describes his character, which is arguably the worst thing about this special next to... everything else since the special wasn't long enough to develop him. I'm sure you can figure out why I'm beating around the bush here, it was... kind of obvious from the beginning of the special.I'm not even going to bother bringing up the “stars” Mewtwo and Mew because they're basically different characters from their first movie counterparts. Well... Mew is probably justifiable since there's multiple Mew anyway, and it's the cutest, maybe most sympathetic character of the special (if you can get past its squeaky Kirby-esque voice and weird-looking design), but it doesn't live up to its status as a Mew. Funny thing, though, that this Mewtwo is a better Mewtwo than the one in “Genesect and the Legend Awakened”. But that's not saying much.ART/ANIMATION: It's standard animation from the TV series and Chronicles, there's nothing about it that really stands out from the norm even during the climatic battle (not even the Mewtwo v. Mew battle). But the CGI that was used is awkward and stilted even for the time, making it up-to-par with the CGI used in “Pokémon 4Ever”. This is where Mewtwo comes in. He channels his inner Vash the Stampede and forms mutant Pokémon heads from his arms for various attacks such as Hyper Beam being shot from a Rayquaza head. And this makes him the “ultimate Pokémon” simply because Mewtwo has the genes of a Mew and thus CAN theoretically use every single attack. But I doubt the masked man was aware of that, he just cared about making this abomination to flaunt around for some reason.SOUND: This is all everyone remembers of this special, so there's no point in beating a dead horse longer than needed. But I might as well bring up that “Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon” is the only thing Pokémon-related that has two English dubs by PUSA: the infamous “testing ground” dub, and the newer dub that's available on the “Lucario and Mystery of Mew” DVD, and is the one I'm going off of. If I had dared to be stupid and risked killing my VCR, I'd have put in my decade-old VHS tape of the special to try and relive my ruined childhood. But I chose not to. Considering even the Internet wants to forget, I couldn't find the original dub for comparison, so it's my fault for chickening out. Not that it matters, as Kayzie Rogers' portrayal of Ash is the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard made of obsidian if memory serves correctly.The soundtrack is from the anime, but it's not dub-created. One notable moment was the original Japanese soundtrack of “Mewtwo Strikes Back” being used to nice effect in the climax. So at the very least, for that reason, it's probably one of the better-handled musical scores for a Pokémon dub. They don't cram in music for every single second of the special, and they allowed at least one dramatic scene to be silent for effect, which is kind of a rarity. I can't say if this continued on for the TPCi dubs of the television series and movies, but here, I can give them credit where it's due.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: Even though I've been a fan since 1999, “Mastermind” is a hard sit more-often than not. It has little to do with the dub, nor the obvious fan-pandering (as it does feel like the special was made with international fans in mind), it's for the unoriginality. Pokémon isn't original, but it has a way to be entertaining and refreshing in ideas. It's not original to fall back on popular, nostalgic ideas for cheap views, it only hurts it even if it's not noticeable at first. Although before it could make its callbacks, the damage was done the moment Ash opened his mouth in the beginning scene of the television broadcast. But even if that wasn't the case, and Veronica Taylor, Eric Stuart, Rachael Lillis, Maddie Blaustein, Stuart Zagnit and even Amy Birnbaum as Max were still their characters, the problems would've slowly been made more prominent as the fans grew up. This is perhaps the only time in the history of dubbing that voice-acting killed a project before it even got out of the gate and forever soiled it for proper unbiased reviewing. I'm not sure if I should be impressed or disheartened by this, albeit I am embarrassed I had sent a letter to 4KIDS in response to the special, whether they read my terrible (and possibly ignorant) ramblings or not.This special's more for the dedicated fan than the casual, but also is one of the ones where you need to let go of the bias of ten years ago. Newer fans luckily don't have to go through with this (count your lucky stars, young'uns), it's just the older ones who will need to in order to rewatch it. But it's not really worth it, not when all the worst of the writing incompetencies come crashing together into a single mess of a special. to this very day, despite the fact the officially-available dub is what features the current cast, not the place-holders in the original.

It felt like a mash-up of recycled ideas from the franchises contained within a 45-minute runtime which somehow...manages to drag on. It all feels rather slapdash, right down to the tiresome feeling villain whose last moments on-screen undermine how nobody cares about the character.

Saikyou Ginga Ultimate Zero: Battle Spirits,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19825/Saikyou_Ginga_Ultimate_Zero__Battle_Spirits,[]
Saint October,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1724/Saint_October,"['[b] Saint October review [/b]Good day, comrades, I\'m pleased to meet your eyes pionted on my review.There is a small chance that you\'re interested in watching Saint October series, isn\'t there?Well, jokes aside, be prepared in a various ways. Saint October has no mercy to your brains, daytime, way of life and relatives. It just comes and transforms yourself into another human being.Trying to approach Saint October for the first time, I\'ve dropped it undoubtely after the 3rd episode. As you can see, I was not prepaired. Few years later followed my second attempt - finished with a 10th mark for Saint October. Recipe: just...get your brain ready, please. Watch Shugo Chara or Nurce Witch Komugi or smth of that genre (Galaxy Angel is fine too!). Be ready to say farewell to your concepts, ideas, stereotypes, change your mind and watch other selves of our Universe.Well, let\'s finally get serious and write the review, maggots! As for me,  Saint October is a mahou shoujo anime, filled with dirty and perverted transformations (they don\'t seem perverted, they\'re designed to be!), silly evil heroes and even more foolish and careless protagonist girls. I\'d like to highlight the most outstanding feature of the series - they are not just full of trash, they emit trash energy waves every episode. Here we can observe an unpredictable course of the plot, the inexplicable scenes (""how could they even imagine to draw this?"" - forget about your ""why did they do it""), uncommon character solutions and so on.[b] Story. [/b]Well, just get along with the idea that you\'re not watching romance, philisophy or fighting series (orly?). Here we have trash mahou shoujo, nothing less and nothing more, latter is because you can\'t make it better. The plot is rather surprising, provided with some unpredictable turns, and gradually revealling further info about the characters involved. A set of stereotipes are gathered and intentionally made laugh of - great decision and execution of the idea. The setting itself is rather interesting -  a great evil company trying to eliminate a boy and several girls. Try watching episode one.Here we face an array of questions.Why are they kidnapping children to find only distinct one? Why not observing before stealing? Because it is trash.Why the great company can\'t use any of the real weapons? Killers, army, police? Because it really is trash!What are those powers? Why are they dressed like that? What\'s happening here?? Yep, you know the answer. Just stay calm and watch.Then why is that falsehood, unlikely story marked 10? Cause it is likely to be found attractive and exciting. Forget about noticing nonsence - producers are not imbeciles, they are making it on intention. That is for your laughs. Furthermore, this collective foolishness of the citizens doesn\'t develop into unbalance - since our protagonists tend to make silly steps, our none too clever evil heroes look rather similar.[b]Art[/b]Speaking about art, it is made rather simple during the main course, but sometimes (and rather frequent, to the authors\' honour!) it changes into fascinating and stunning scenes (oh, what am I writing!). Well, there are some spectacular visual effects, especially with moving objects, or with the dynamic camera. All of them add to the trash radiance, so let them be.The surroundings seem to be neatly and precisely made too. People, walking along the streets, moving cars, carefully drawn scenery.Oh, right, let\'s get to the point of interest. Lolis are loliconic, yep. With anatomic details. And that transformation scenes! That Scenes!![b]Sound[/b]Music and songs are not of the amusing or catchy ones. Nonetheless, you wouldn\'t find them awful. Background sounds could be ranked as high-quality, since they have a good timing (also no lack of them could be noticed on the spot) and don\'t seem to interrupt the course of the events.The highlight sounds are voices. They fit characters, and provide the feeling of voice actresses really doing their job neatly and with love. Well done![b]Characters[/b]Don\'t find it necessary to introduce every character on its own. I\'ll better try to make a general review.The characters are bright and distinctive. Lots of them appear to be something more than originally expected. Some characters are slightly evolving, but in general you won\'t find it great psichological series (oh, man, I\'m lying again!).To make it clear, let\'s point out - characters are really bright! Each has its own hobby, appearence, foolishness,... even array of face expressions! You\'ll be screenshooting them, I bet! Not to ommit evil charas - they\'re something too![b]Enjoyment[/b]10/10, definetely. If you appreciate trash. Predicting the next scene or the entire plot gets boring? Well, Saint October is for you. Looking for lolis fighting with rocket launchers, claymores, devil devices? Saint October is at your disposal again. Among my animelist, these series are getting the most trash, chaotic, entropic and unpredictable award for sure. Lolicon aspect is of best quality too.[b]Overall[/b]As you can see, I\'m far from being adequate, since I\'ve really liked this anime and therefore lack any objectiveness. As for me, it is a ten of all tens of ten. Just try it!Thanks for reading! Hope you won\'t find this review disgraceful, - you\'ve been warned to train your brains and perception on Shugo Chara before Saint October. More than that, please have a nice days watching Saint october!Good luck! get your brain ready, please. Watch Shugo Chara or Nurce Witch Komugi or smth of that genre (Galaxy Angel is fine too!).

Here we can observe an unpredictable course of the plot, the inexplicable scenes (""how could they even imagine to draw this?"" - forget about your ""why did they do it""), uncommon character solutions and so on.[b] Story. [/b]Well, just get along with the idea that you\'re not watching romance, philisophy or fighting series (orly?). Here we have trash mahou shoujo, nothing less and nothing more, latter is because you can\'t make it better. The plot is rather surprising, provided with some unpredictable turns, and gradually revealling further info about the characters involved. A set of stereotipes are gathered and intentionally made laugh of - great decision and execution of the idea. The setting itself is rather interesting -  a great evil company trying to eliminate a boy and several girls. Try watching episode one.Here we face an array of questions.Why are they kidnapping children to find only distinct one? Why not observing before stealing? Because it is trash.Why the great company can\'t use any of the real weapons? Killers, army, police? Because it really is trash!What are those powers? Why are they dressed like that? What\'s happening here?? Yep, you know the answer. Just stay calm and watch.Then why is that falsehood, unlikely story marked 10? Cause it is likely to be found attractive and exciting. Forget about noticing nonsence - producers are not imbeciles, they are making it on intention. That is for your laughs. Furthermore, this collective foolishness of the citizens doesn\'t develop into unbalance - since our protagonists tend to make silly steps, our none too clever evil heroes look rather similar.[b]Art[/b]Speaking about art, it is made rather simple during the main course, but sometimes (and rather frequent, to the authors\' honour!) it changes into fascinating and stunning scenes (oh, what am I writing!). Well, there are some spectacular visual effects, especially with moving objects, or with the dynamic camera. All of them add to the trash radiance, so let them be.The surroundings seem to be neatly and precisely made too. People, walking along the streets, moving cars, carefully drawn scenery.Oh, right, let\'s get to the point of interest. Lolis are loliconic, yep. With anatomic details. And that transformation scenes! That Scenes!![b]Sound[/b]Music and songs are not of the amusing or catchy ones. Nonetheless, you wouldn\'t find them awful. Background sounds could be ranked as high-quality, since they have a good timing (also no lack of them could be noticed on the spot) and don\'t seem to interrupt the course of the events.The highlight sounds are voices. They fit characters, and provide the feeling of voice actresses really doing their job neatly and with love. Well done![b]Characters[/b]Don\'t find it necessary to introduce every character on its own. I\'ll better try to make a general review.The characters are bright and distinctive. Lots of them appear to be something more than originally expected. Some characters are slightly evolving, but in general you won\'t find it great psichological series (oh, man, I\'m lying again!).To make it clear, let\'s point out - characters are really bright! Each has its own hobby, appearence, foolishness,... even array of face expressions! You\'ll be screenshooting them, I bet! Not to ommit evil charas - they\'re something too![b]Enjoyment[/b]10/10, definetely. If you appreciate trash. Predicting the next scene or the entire plot gets boring? Well, Saint October is for you. Looking for lolis fighting with rocket launchers, claymores, devil devices? Saint October is at your disposal again. Among my animelist, these series are getting the most trash, chaotic, entropic and unpredictable award for sure. Lolicon aspect is of best quality too.[b]Overall[/b]As you can see, I\'m far from being adequate, since I\'ve really liked this anime and therefore lack any objectiveness. As for me, it is a ten of all tens of ten. Just try it!Thanks for reading! Hope you won\'t find this review disgraceful, - you\'ve been warned to train your brains and perception on Shugo Chara before Saint October. More than that, please have a nice days watching Saint october!Good luck!', 'It was difficult for me to sit down and write this review. Not because of a lack of motivation or outright dislike for the show, but due to my inability to pinpoint exactly what it tries to do. To make it simple, Saint October is made up of two distinct parts. One side is that of the comedy, where Kotono and Natsuki are being cute and eating cake together, Misaki riding around on the sentient bear she befriended, Koushirou playing the lazy tsukkomi while receiving the butt end of jokes, and Kurtz doing something absolutely outrageous in his office. Confronting that is the drama and...the serious topics at hand. These two sides clash against each other in every episode, and this indecisiveness in direction is what I find to be the main issue of the show.In certain anime, such as Gintama, this actually works in the series’ favour. The different tones are intertwined intrinsically and the humour moves seamlessly into the deeper themes. This doesn’t happen in Saint October. There’s a constant feeling that it’s trying to do the individual moments right, without consideration for what these moments end up forming once they align. This leads to some fundamental issues emerging even when the anime is presenting its more important topics. The humorous undertones creeps into the parts where it shouldn’t be present, and it’s impossible to fully shake it off. As an example, Misaki’s backstory is driven by avenging her lover’s death. It’s a reasonable motivation, albeit slightly underdeveloped, that offers some insight into her personality. However, the episode that is dedicated to this reveals that the person she seeks to kill is reduced to little more than a jolly robot that runs a cake shop. Unfortunately these jarring tonal shifts continue to happen throughout the series, even up to the final few episodes. You end up not being able to take what happens particularly seriously, which is a huge detriment considering there isn’t a lot of characterisation and depth to begin with.The first half of Saint October is laid out in a fairly repetitive format. Reverse is sending out different agents so as to capture Kotono & Ewan. Think Team Rocket going for Pikachu and you already have the gist of it. Of course, this brings with it the issue of predictability since it’s evident Kotono won’t ever be defeated. The second half is where it picks up the pace a bit and steers into what ends up being a fairly entertaining show. A highlight for me is Joshua’s flashback episode that manages to develop three (!) characters at once. But in line with what ends up becoming a recurring issue with Saint October, there is one wrong to go with every right. Episode 12 is arguably one of the best episodes in the series. Kotono receives a reality check regarding what she’s been doing all along, and breaks down as a result. It was delivered nicely, without any misplaced comedy there to dampen the fall. Then the following episode comes along and gives possibly the weakest excuse you will ever hear to get her back in action again.Honestly, I can take less than stellar writing. My biggest issue is that the amount of motivation put on the table is far from sufficient. Typically it is brought up once, dealt with, and then ignored for the rest of the series. One of the only times a theme is brought up again is in regards to the previously mentioned one. The penultimate episode touches upon this topic once more and somehow deals with it even worse. “You didn’t know, so it’s fine”. All this ends up doing is raising the question of how much the creators wanted to get the drama out of the way so they could dive straight back into the jokes again. The amount of logical liberties taken in the comedic scenes leak into other parts of the show, and it really makes you question the intellect of characters when they by all means should know better. One example of which is Kotono trying to storm the enemy headquarters alone and without any powers at her disposal. So when there’s too little, and that small amount is of low quality, disappointment is inevitable. Then again, maybe I’m the fool for expecting a show about magical girl lolis working at a detective agency to do something serious in the first place.It’s a shame, because I really wanted to like this anime more than I did. The potential is there, the setting is too, but almost everything is underdeveloped to the point where it feels like what little there is only serves as the basis for the comedy. At its core it’s nothing more than a slice of life show that tries to bite off a bit more than it can chew. Its saving grace is the fact that the humour can actually be pretty funny, and the characters in the world are as well. Kurtz in particular ended up as one of my favourite characters ever due to his antics, and his unpredictability as a villain really put a spin on what came to be expected at times. That in itself elevated the worth of the series for me. Still, it’s absolutely true that Saint October would lose its identity if it were to pull back on or even scrap the comedy entirely. I’m certain this anime will be right up the alley of people who want some lighthearted entertainment, and while I didn’t expect something fully as genre-breaking as Madoka Magica, I for sure had the hopes that it could steer its own plot points forward in a convincing manner.Instead, I’m still sitting here wondering how the hell Ewan could feel that Kotono was in danger when she was no longer bound by the card he gave her. the serious topics at hand.

Seizei Ganbare! Mahou Shoujo Kurumi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35510/Seizei_Ganbare_Mahou_Shoujo_Kurumi,"['Seizei Ganbare Mahou Shoujo Kurumi is a parody of the Mahou Shoujo genre and consists of short almost completely joke filled episodes. It is very episodic and it doesn’t have much of a story beyond magical girls fighting monsters.I found the voice acting to be surprisingly good for this kind of show. Visually the show reminds me of cheap kid shows, with its bright colors and bad animation; although it has some fairly brutal scenes. Personally I really enjoy that style and it fits the show well.Most of the comedy consists of making fun of the common tropes of the Mahou Shoujo genre and how...brutal the magical girls are when fighting the monsters. In fact, the majority of the show consists of these three guys commenting on the brutal and ridiculous events that are happening in front of them.I am a big fan of the Mahou Shoujo genre and I think the jokes are generally really clever and point to stupid tropes in the genre that I never reflected on before. brutal the magical girls are when fighting the monsters.

This anime is only 4 minutes per episode, so u basically wont lose that much time watching this anime. Tbh i actually love short anime, like Teekyuu and Saiki Kusuo. As they always straight to the points, and no pointless scene.2. This anime has absurd wacky style of comedy, my favorites kind of humor. Its kinda similar to Nichijou and Senyuu style of comedy.3. Well i just love cute loli anime. And Azuchimomoyama is damn cute....Story/Plot:Each episode plot is usually about something silly happens in the beginning, then silly monster appears and introduce itself, and ended with the monster destroyed in silly way. Yeah everything in this anime is silly and wacky, as this anime has absurd wacky comedy style similar to Teekyuu and Senyuu. Oh, and there are always trio guys, Azuchimomoyama's schoolmates who doing funny tsukkomi in the background.Characters:Azuchimomoyama Kurumi: She is Prima Angel Pink, and the primary mc. She is pictured as silly cute girl, and the one who doing the magical girl parody the most. She uses all kind of gory weapons to destroy the monster, like Thorn Staff, Saw Blade, and Morning Star. She is over all just so funny, and the one who carries this show.Sangenshoku Mizugi: She is Prima Angel Blue. She wears glasses and looks like a shy bookworm girl. In episode 9 Azuchimomoyama coerces her to become a Prima Angel. She uses sword and knife as weapons.Yushuehima Mikan: She is Prima Angel Orange. She has short hair and speak in Kansai accent. She mysteriously appears in episode 10, without any introduction beforehand. She uses all kinds of guns and pistols as weapons.Trio Tsukkomi:Isamu (red clothes): He is usually the ones who got captured by enemy and the one who wants to see Azuchimomoyama's panties the most. He usually gives positive exaggerated tsukkomi.Kiyoshi (blue clothes): He is the one who usually gives neutral tsukkomi.Shigeru (yellow clothes): He is the one who wore glasses and looks like the most intelligent of the trio. He usually gives negative critic tsukkomi.Art and Sounds:This anime has nice pastel colors animation. Everything in this anime is designed to look somehow cutes, even the monsters.The Opening Song of this anime is pretty awesome. It is so catchy. I am not bored and truly never skip the OP in each episodes I watch.The Ending Song are just silly weird song sung by the trio tsukkomi. Well, it is pretty funny if you listen once in a while. But you might get bored easily if you listen it in every episodes.Enjoyment:Yeah I enjoy this anime very much. Even I got truly sad when the subtitler stops releasing the subtitles after episode 9 for several months. I try watching this anime in the youtube with youtube auto-translator, but the result is horrible. Well, what I want to say is, I truly damn love this anime, as much as I love Saiki Kusuo no Psi Nan and Senyuu..Overall: This is awesome short anime. It is truly funny but still has a great concept.

Senran Kagura Estival Versus: Mizugi-darake no Zenyasai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/27967/Senran_Kagura_Estival_Versus__Mizugi-darake_no_Zenyasai,"['Well, it\'s Senran Kagura.  I\'m not going to bother explaining what it\'s about and assume that you have some prior knowledge of the series here.  Young women who call themselves shinobi fight each other and lose their clothes in the process.  Classic light-hearted ecchi.  I like the franchise, I enjoy the characters, and I was excited for this release.The problem with this OVA for me is very simple though - there are so many characters in SK that when you try to condense the cast into a 24m OVA, each of them can be afforded a scant few moments of screentime...and, as a result, the cast is reduced even further beyond the stereotypes they already represent.  Characters that can actually be funny in the games (Ryoubi/Ryouna, Katsuragi, Murasaki, Yagyu/Hibari) still throw out their same gags, but it just feels a little lifeless and forced here.  There\'s no room for the jokes to land.  I almost wish they had chosen to focus on a single school for this OVA instead of the full cast for that reason.That\'s not me saying that this OVA needed a better story or something, by the way.  What introduction does girls stripping each other until they blush and say ""KYAAAA!"" really need?  But one of the hallmarks of the SK franchise (if not the fundamental core) has always been the characters themselves, who lean so heavily into tropes that it becomes a form of parody.  Without the witty personalities of the cast, much of the charm of SK is lost on me, and it ends up feeling like a shell of what I actually enjoy about the series (although maybe I should be expecting as much from a short OVA like this).All that said, the art is great, the VAs are fantastic (when they get a line to speak) and the fan service is even more over the top than it is in the games.  Nipples can be shown here so expect to see tons of them (although I will be honest - was kind of hoping for some more variety in types of nipples, tiny/pink over and over loses its impact and, imo, further diminishes the uniqueness of the individual girls).  So if skin is what you\'re looking for, you will find it.  Just don\'t expect the same sharpness in terms of writing that you would normally find in other SK media, and if your best girl isn\'t Yumi, prepare to groan when she gets side-lined. and, as a result, the cast is reduced even further beyond the stereotypes they already represent.

Softenni,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10109/Softenni,"[""If you are curious soft tennis is a modified version of normal tennis using rubber balls, and was created after being introduced to the east in the early 1900's. Thus, five airheads entertain us with their insane antics and personalities as they play it. Softenni is one of the most hit or miss comedies I have recently watched.With a comedy it comes down to the characters and how they interact. The captain Chitose who is unable to hit a single ball, enjoys eating, and is basically the most annoying and least important. Compared to her we have Asuna, who  is the instigator of all...that is ecchi with her delusions, and her partner Kotone whom has fallen in love with their coach and is aiming for Wimbledon. We have the foreigner Eli who is the rival in love, and Kurusu who is a hardcore cosplayer. Typically Asuna and Kotone are the ones training and playing while Kurusu and Eli do random things in the background.Unfortunately, there are only a few occasions where there is an actual match. There are two different teams we meet throughout the season, and while kotone his hard headed and competitive they act more as friends than rivals. The matches in general don't matter, as they turn into a giant joke within the first few seconds. Despite the huge focus on comedy, there is a general plot as they aim towards the nationals, but no huge progress.On a whole I would like to think I enjoyed this series a lot. However there was two occasions I gave the episode a 1/5 and the rest of the scores are all either 2's, 4's, or 5's for the most part. This is a issue with a lot of comedies that are do not split the episode into mini sub stories. With the focus on something, let's say a windy day on the tennis court, for a whole episode it can get old fast if it doesn't provide any laughs in the first place.As a tennis coach I was able to enjoy the insanity that was softenni. A combination of ecchi, tsukkomi, as well as situational humor there is no doubt that it can be entertaining. I wouldn't strongly recommend this show as there are slightly stronger comedies out there, but there wouldn't be any harm in trying it out. Well, one of the 1's was episode one as well so maybe try two. that is ecchi with her delusions, and her partner Kotone whom has fallen in love with their coach and is aiming for Wimbledon. We have the foreigner Eli who is the rival in love, and Kurusu who is a hardcore cosplayer. Typically Asuna and Kotone are the ones training and playing while Kurusu and Eli do random things in the background.Unfortunately, there are only a few occasions where there is an actual match. There are two different teams we meet throughout the season, and while kotone his hard headed and competitive they act more as friends than rivals. The matches in general don't matter, as they turn into a giant joke within the first few seconds. Despite the huge focus on comedy, there is a general plot as they aim towards the nationals, but no huge progress.On a whole I would like to think I enjoyed this series a lot.

With the captain of the club Chitose Akiyama voiced by Shizuka Ito who can\'t hit the ball and cares more about food, Kurusu Fuyukawa voiced by Satomi Akesaka as the strange mysterious girl who is strangely proficient in soft tennis but does some weird cosplays, Kotone Sawanatsu voiced by Eri Kitamura as the athletic-centered type but can\'t control her power and has a crush on her coach You Mishimagi voiced by Shinobu Matsumoto and Asuna...Harukaze voiced by Kanae Ito, the ditz of the group but has wild fantasies whenever, WHENEVER there is a hint of an sexual innuendo and latter on Elizabeth Warren voiced by Sayuri Yahagi, the foreigner of the group who ALSO has a crush on the coach and like Kurusu is an airhead most of the time and the last member Yayoi Hiragishi voiced by Haruka Tomatsu with a tragic backstory about her sister and her anting to join the club with uhhh ""splitting"" results. With this we have a typical slapstick, comedy driven anime focusing on soft tennis with varying degrees of success in terms of plot and comedy.Softenni relies on the soft tennis as more of a backdrop for the characters and quirky antics to flourish in the comedy with the fanservice also having a HEAVY hand in it but that a bit later. The character interactions and the hijinks is the usual driving force of the anime\'s comedy and how sometimes one certain action from the core cast leads them down an almost rabbit hole of craziness and this being anime, it goes crazy funny, sometimes falls flat, sometimes both and for an anime in 2011...it\'s alright in all circumstances. As comedy is subjective and how this is an anime centred around soft tennis and comedy, it has it\'s flaws but some strengths and in it\'s strengths LA will at least say is that Softenni if anything KNOWS how to make a running gag going and sometimes makes a callback in the weirdest and sometimes funniest ways and in a ways, even though the two most focused characters in this anime are Kotone and Asuna, they are the most developed even for a comedy screwball ecchi anime from 2011.So the fanservice, well to say that this is Xebec is an obvious hint to what\'s to come but Xebec took some hints from TNK in which they panty shots and nudity ABUNDANT and LA watched the uncensored version and the fanservice is HEAVY to say the least. No the fanservice is at least serviceable and not in your nose about it, they unlike TNK does it stealthily, it\'s the nudity count that will make your drinking game make you SOBER by the end of it all. So take what LA said about the fanservice as you will...But yes from what LA said about the strengths of this anime, the two out of the five of the core cast are the most developed and with Asuna being the narrative focus whilst Kotone goes through some romance arc as well as one involving her and Asuna later, they are the most developed, while the rest of the cast more or less develops their running gags if anything and doesn\'t really develop beyond that unfortunately, which is sad as someone like Chitose, a character who can\'t HIT A BALL could\'ve been interesting but instead left as comedy fodder for majority of the anime and LA actually liked Chitose (and because she was voiced by Shizuka Ito) to us finding out snippets of Kurusu but never pinpointing ""who she is"". Yeah to put into contrast to Kotone and Asuna, Chitose and Kurusu were probably the least developed characters, plot wise in Softenni (sans Yayoi as she only had like ONE episode and that was her introductory episode and she barely have any screentime afterwards)The animation aforementioned was done by Xebec and for the most part, the animation done by them was actually pretty decent even for an ecchi anime, with decent character designs, ok background work and typical chibi-fied comedy reactions. There\'s not much beyond that for animation, it\'s just alright even with the heavy amount of fanservice it has.The voice cast is kinda what drew LA into this anime and namely Shizuka Ito and Kanae Ito and LA will say at least Kanae Ito and Eri Kitamura were probably MVP\'s in this anime considering their screentime, whilst Shizuka Ito ended up as the shy type role. But the rest of cast from Sayuri Yahagi as Elizabeth, Satomi Akesaka as Kurusu to some minor voice actors like Minako Kotobuki as Misaki to Haruka Tomatsu as Yayoi. There are some very good voice actors in this anime and yeah due to the rather skewed character hijinks focus, some voice actors got to shine, some were typecast but all in all...decent to GREAT voice cast.Softenni is pretty much what you get to the exact mark when LA says ""a comedy screwball ecchifest anime about soft tennis and the club\'s crazy antics"". Was it good?, in LA\'s experience in watching it...it was alright, just typical from what you expect from LA\'s aforementioned statement about Softenni.

Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke wo: Reo x Mai Diaries,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10384/Sono_Hanabira_ni_Kuchizuke_wo__Reo_x_Mai_Diaries,"[""I’m not entirely sure why this show is registered here on MAL, since it’s not really an anime or even animation to begin with. This is more of a fully voice-acted visual novel without anything interactive that you watch someone else play, if that makes any sense.The story is a sequel to the visual novel “Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke wo: Anata to Koibito Tsunagi”, better known for the highly recommended hentai adaptation of the same name. I recommend playing the novel or at least watching the OVA first before starting this, so that you understand how the relationship of the main characters work.The story follows...the characters Reo Kawamura, a very tsundere, second year high school student, and Mai Sawaguchi, a classmate of Reo and a teaser. Yeah, that isn’t a whole lot, but that is really all I can say about them, based on this show.We follow them during their daily life as a couple with a plot that consists mostly of the two girls talking about mobile phones and them going out to buy one for Reo, since she hasn’t had one since she was three and therefore barely knows anything about them.Conversations are mostly about the wondrous things a phone can do, followed by an oblivious response from Reo, a teasing response from Mai, followed by Reo becoming embarrassed or angry, ending in Mai hugging Reo because she finds Reo so incredibly cute, making Reo even more embarrassed and angry.Seriously, the girls bicker so much that I started wondering why exactly they love each other. This is never really explained in the OVA either, but the difference is that they just started a relationship there and were still new and inexperienced with lesbianism. The focus of that show was more showing off THAT they were in love instead of why and it does an excellent job at that.This ONA would have been the perfect opportunity to expand on their relationship and go into more detail about what they like about each other, but alas, conversations about mobile phones and a cute, embarrassed Reo it is.So, yeah, don't expect a deep and complicated story with lots of character development. This is really nothing more than a pretty bland, though cute, continuation of a story about two girls in love.Animation is literally non-existent. Like I said, this is more of a visual novel than an animated show and really only consists of a background with the characters in the foreground, who occasionally switch poses and facial expressions. Luckily, the backgrounds and character models are quite detailed and colorful and overall very nice to look at.Voice-acting is pretty good too, at least for what I can tell as a non-Japanese person, though the facial expressions don’t always seem to match up. This is rather common for a visual novel, since they only have a limited amount of expressions, but still, on more than one occasion I just thought they could have used a more fitting picture.Music is really nothing special, it serves its purpose and fits the tone, but it’s not really memorable and most of the time it just plays unnoticeable in the background. The music for the 10 second opening and closing got on my nerve at some point since you hear it twice per episode and I found myself skipping it more often than not.Overall this show is cute and made me smile every now and then, but it’s fairly skippable. The repetition in dialogue, the tsundere aspects of Reo (becoming angry and embarrassed) and her obliviousness to mobile phones gets rather tedious at some point, but since the episodes are so short (5-10 minutes), you won’t waste much of your time.Look it up on YouTube if you’re bored and have nothing better to do. the characters Reo Kawamura, a very tsundere, second year high school student, and Mai Sawaguchi, a classmate of Reo and a teaser.

This is rather common for a visual novel, since they only have a limited amount of expressions, but still, on more than one occasion I just thought they could have used a more fitting picture.Music is really nothing special, it serves its purpose and fits the tone, but it’s not really memorable and most of the time it just plays unnoticeable in the background. The music for the 10 second opening and closing got on my nerve at some point since you hear it twice per episode and I found myself skipping it more often than not.Overall this show is cute and made me smile every now and then, but it’s fairly skippable. The repetition in dialogue, the tsundere aspects of Reo (becoming angry and embarrassed) and her obliviousness to mobile phones gets rather tedious at some point, but since the episodes are so short (5-10 minutes), you won’t waste much of your time.Look it up on YouTube if you’re bored and have nothing better to do."", ""I'm quite surprised that this is rated as well rated as it is on MAL.  Ahem, this ONA series tells a story about a couple, Reo and Mai, and their regular time together.  The story is pretty linear, and of course, there's no filler (it's an ONA about a visual novel and only 6 to 10-ish minutes each episode).  The linearity of the story made me enjoy the series a lot more than if it wasn't.  As for characters, Reo's a little generically shy/tsundere, but Mai's teasing of Reo is great especially in the later episodes.  Some major bad things...about the series however: microphone peaking quite a bit (Reo mostly), the volume mastery is par at best (too quiet at times and too loud at others--the VA's faults), and the animation/art is just basic visual novel assets (of course, imagination helps).Story: 7-ishArt: 6-ishSound: 6-ishCharacter: 7-ishHm...  I did like the series personally (despite having an easier time finding the hentai than the ONA series, seriously).  I managed to find it on youtube after searching in Japanese, so I ended up just relying on my existing knowledge of Japanese (the language was pretty simple, imo).Ah, almost forgot to say: I loved the intro/outro song way too much.Overall (while rounding up): 7 about the series however: microphone peaking quite a bit (Reo mostly), the volume mastery is par at best (too quiet at times and too loud at others--the VA's faults), and the animation/art is just basic visual novel assets (of course, imagination helps).Story: 7-ishArt: 6-ishSound: 6-ishCharacter: 7-ishHm...

Very disappointing, since i was looking forward to watching an anime about a lesbian couple in their daily life and not a super dramatic story of two lesbians being angsty and all ""OMG BUT SHE\'S A GIRL, HOW COULD I EVER??"" and ""I LOVE HER!"" and""BUT WE CAN\'T BE TOGETHER!"".Unfortunately this isn\'t what i hoped for, so if you are also looking for what i was, don\'t bother, it\'s not worth your...time! time!']"
