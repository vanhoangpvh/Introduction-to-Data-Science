Grenadier: Hohoemi no Senshi Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4361/Grenadier__Hohoemi_no_Senshi_Specials,"[""If you finished Grenadier and want more material, you can easily watch this special. Each episode is one minute and a few seconds, it's animated and presents some funny scenarios from the main show. Some scenes here are parodies of the anime and I can say that I found it hilarious.Have no worries because we have some sexy scenes also, nothing too extreme though, just the right amount of ecchi with Rushuna and the other girls.I recommend to be watched after the TV anime because it has inside jokes from episode 12. Overall, a very fun watch and I enjoyed it, unfortunately it's too short...for how I prefer this type of omake, blink it and you lose it. for how I prefer this type of omake, blink it and you lose it.""]"

You've either got to be in Japan or trick either Google Play or the App Store into thinking you're in Japan to obtain the app.  I heard there's some Russian subtitles out now or something, so hopefully there'll be English subtitles out soon.Story...[8]It's slice of life, so the stories are just tidbits of stuff that goes on.  The overall theme is people helping out the main character Rin since she lives alone.Art [7]The art is weird, it's the best I've seen for any anime on the Tate Anime app, but it's not like it's all that great.  I'd say the art is pretty good, but the motion and animation is limited or something like that.  Also it's upright video since it's Tate Anime, so that's a bit weird, but they did well with it.Sound [9]The opening theme is pretty good in my opinion.  They played this one song at the very end that was even better, but I can't figure out how to find it.  The mix of voices overall works well, and the background sound and effects are all good.Character [9]I dunno, I really liked all the characters.  The main character Rin especially was a really chill character.  There's a few supporting characters throughout the show who are neat as well.Enjoyment [10]Super chill, I'm definitely going to watch this again when subs come out.Overall [9]Yeah, this anime is pretty chill, I'd advise you at least check it out if you like slice of life.  If you're learning Japanese, it's actually sort of a cool show to watch without subtitles cause I'm at a basic level and I could pick up a surprising amount of the things going on.This is my first review, I'm really surprised how much I wrote, so I hope it's helpful.  I just saw this had no review and thought somebody's got to write one. [8]It's slice of life, so the stories are just tidbits of stuff that goes on.

I will make it simple as possible.Hitorigurashi no Shougakusei tells a story about the  little girl whose living her life without parents as she only keep running a restaurant business. The main character is bad in cooking, but her attitude makes the people attract to her restaurant at the same time. People may judge her social role (she's somehow poor wearing teared clothes), however it's not a hindrance for her. Other people around sometimes help her.Story...(9/10)The story is original.

So get a drink, and simply take in these 30 minutes."", ""Hitorigurashi no Shougakusei is a truly adorable, heartwarming anime, with some rock-bottom production quality that is uniquely terrible, and present during every moment of the show. Beginning with the strong point of this anime by a mile, the story itself is great. A little slice of life about a struggling orphan girl living alone and trying to support herself and save money wherever possible, be it skipping meals, using duct tape as an eraser, or trying to bring in customers to her little shop. Even given the state of her life, she remains pure, innocent, and committed to the happiness of others throughout. The townspeople...around her are by and large very kind and supporting people, and to see how they treat such an unfortunate girl with immense kindness is genuinely nice. One could ask, then, why one of them don't just adopt her, but that's part of the suspension of disbelief required to really enjoy this show. It is a really nice little story, and that much cannot be overstated. Now for the rest of this anime. The art has a pretty standard art direction, with character designs that are serviceable don't really stand out, but the execution of the art is awful. It is barely animated, and all sorts of little tricks are used to conceal this fact. The aspect ratio of the show is also jarring, bizarrely looking as though it's meant for a vertical phone screen. The sound is atrocious, as though everything from the music to the voice work was recorded through a tin can, reverberating in a way that sounds cheap, artificial, and robotic. The charters are strong, but Rin absolutely steals the show. She is the nexus of the whole anime, and her defiant optimism and kindness in the face of her situation make her a pleasure to have as a protagonist. Overall, Hitorigurashi no Shougakusei is a sweet little OVA that suffers from some dire production issues. Regardless of how bad the execution is, I still recommend you watch it, if for no other reason than the touching story it offers. around her are by and large very kind and supporting people, and to see how they treat such an unfortunate girl with immense kindness is genuinely nice.

iDOLM@STER Xenoglossia,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1694/iDOLMSTER_Xenoglossia,"['To tell the truth, I was not expecting much from this anime at all. Judging by all of the reviews and comments that I have seen floating around on the internet, I was prepared for a trainwreck. However I was pleasantly surprised when I was proven wrong.Xenoglossia\'s plot is ridiculous, to under-exaggerate. Add robots punching meteors together with Girl x Robot romance, and plot twists thrown left and right, and you get Xenoglossia. However, for a good part of the show - until just a little over half way - we have a story better categorised as a \'slice of life\'. Rather, as a \'slice...of a mecha pilot\'s life\'. For some people, this may be seen as an euphemism for \'slow\', but I digress. These episodes were used extremely well for building up character relationships and personalities. After this \'slow\' beginning is the point where the action really starts, and we begin the rollercoaster ride of emotions. Viewers who survive until the end of the series will be rewarded with one of the best endings to ever grace anime. (Disclaimer - the previous sentence is subjective.)Not having watched many mecha series before, my opinion on the art of the mecha may reek of inexperience, so I will just say that ""I did not dislike it"". Existing iDOLM@STER fans may be discomforted by the huge difference in character design initially, compared to the original designs, as was I. However the character designs have gradually grown onto me, and I can say that I have even come to like them. Other than that the animation is fluid, and there certainly are not many noticeable animation mistakes, as expected from Sunrise.The background music is merely \'there\'; not overwhelming, nor was it lacking. Voice acting was top notch, and never annoying or unnatural. The OPs and EDs were very catchy. I always enjoy the intro of EDs being played just before the ED animation sequence begins. Xenoglossia did this in every episode, if I am not mistaken, so it receives a bonus in this category for this.Now we come to the best part of this anime. Remember that slow first half of the series? This is why it was seemingly slow: it is packed full of character development. It is only because half of the series is dedicated to introducing and building the characters that I was so attached to them. This is the first show I have watched where I was affected so deeply by the characters. Truly, my feelings reflected those of the characters - Haruka especially - and my heart was heavy when the characters were depressed. I could even understand Imber\'s feelings, who did not have a single line of dialogue throughout the entire show. It only through the continued exposure to the characters and their antics that we can notice these changes in character throughout the series. Because of this, every decision each character makes is clearly supported by their motivations. Coincidentally, this was the show which helped me fully understand the phrase \'character development\'.As you may deduce, I enjoyed this series immensely, and I could not bear to see that counter on MAL gradually rise to reach \'26\'. As I have said in the beginning, I had expected this show to be a trainwreck. But to my surprise, when I had finished this show, I felt very empty inside. This has only ever happened once before, when I finished K-On!!, which I loved at the time. I did not feel like starting up another series, or watching anime, for that matter, which only ever happens when I finish series that I grow very attached to.So, what prompted me to write this review? Xenoglossia is so tremendously underrated that it depresses me. A score of 6.85 (at the time of this review) is usually reserved for very terrible anime. I am not saying that Xenoglossia is a masterpiece, but it definitely does not deserve such a low score. This score is easily explained though.A reason for this is that there is not much in the way of action in this anime at all, for an anime which is categorised as \'mecha\' and \'action\'. Most of the action during the earlier half of this anime consists of robots punching meteors in space. It is only nearing the end of the series that there is any considerable amount of mecha action.Xenoglossia is truly an exciting ride of emotions. It is a series that I will always look back on fondly, remembering the surprise I had when I could not let it go. of a mecha pilot\'s life\'.

First of all I don't normally watch mecha, so my knowledge about them is minimal, to the point I can count with my hands and still have fingers left of the amount of shows that have them I have seen.When you jump into XENOGLOSSIA as an IDOLMASTER fan, you are prepared for the consequences. Aside from Haruka (which doesn't saves herself too much either, but it is the most...intact character) all the character personalities are TWISTED, in the meaning that they aren't what you normally see on the franchise. Do you know Makoto? the one that strives to become girlier and wants to be an IDOL? She is DARN SEXY but very mean towards everyone, she only cares about missions and her big  sister complex. Ami? DOCILE AND QUIET (wut) she is as energetic as her sister, but Xenoglossia didn't care, and made her to be a quiet (yet very helpful) girl. Yukiho? Not afraid of men anymore, still quiet, not so much change until later in the show. Chihaya? Well, not that she isn't like that, but they gave her plot, she is old and very dark as a person, even more than before, and I can go on and on about how the chars sucked... but there's a trick for thisThe only way you can really enjoy this anime is to forget that this even has IDOLM@STER characters. Forget it, and you'll get your run of the mill EVA wannabe show. Realizing this sooner would had prevented the amounts of time the impressions I had on certain characters crumbled into tiny bits.The story becomes good by the episode , but is still not good enough.

There are some hidden secrets and such, and many of the people are connected in some way. However, while there isn't a problem with this formula, it was executed terribly. Most of the &quot;revelations&quot; weren't surprising, and when you expected something great, it couldn't have been any further from it.For a mecha anime, there was a surprising lack of action throughout the whole series until the end. When there was action, it was extremely boring. It's almost as if they were saving their budget for the end, and as a result,...the ending significantly better than the rest. But still, this is not saying much. There were definitely some plot holes*, or at least events that should not have even happened if the characters had a fraction of a brain.Oh, and look out for some episodes (not that I recommend watching it) that basically mirror NGE and musical ideals that parallel RahXephon somewhat. It just seems to be an extremely bad mashup of other mecha anime.ART: I did like the designs of the mecha, especially when shown up close. Overall, the art was done quite well, and so was the animation -- again, it looked quite good for the last couple of episodes. There also weren't that many reused scenes (probably due to the lack of a significant amount of action). In fact, the only one I can't think of off the top of my head is the launch sequence.SOUND: I won't go into this too much. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't excellent. However, along with the animation, it was one of the better aspects. Plus, you should not be basing a watch on sound when there are more imperative qualities that are lacking.CHARACTER: This is probably my biggest gripe with this anime. I couldn't even count all the time I was left entirely disgusted with the amount of angst that all of the pilots had. Just when you think they became a better person and learned that important lesson, they regress back to exactly where they started. Talk about frustrating.And of course, the relationship between Master and Idol was portrayed ridiculously. The main character, Haruka, said multiple times that she loved her Idol. She even called it her boyfriend. I am not making this up. No matter how many times they said that the Idols might have something equivalent to a heart, it's a ****ing robot. Really, it started to get extremely creepy.OVERALL: I could go on about other faults with it. It's really just an average mecha anime, but they also did some very odd things with it. It just makes one question their thought process when they were making it. You also might be wondering why I finished it -- believe me, I had a hard time. But I just don't like to drop a series for some reason. So even though it was obvious that I don't like it, it wasn't bad enough to where I had to drop it. I definitely thought about it more than once; thank God it started to get better eventually (although it took around 18 episodes).*PLOT HOLE; HUGE SPOILER: For example, why could Chihaya pilot Imber near the end all of a sudden when he was supposed to be so finicky? the ending significantly better than the rest.

Don't watch it will waste 30mins of your life "", 'As many other reviews are quick to point out, Idolmaster: Xenoglossia has quite a lot of stuff working against it. In fact, I think it has a lot *more* going against it than people seem to give it credit for. I would almost call it cursed!For starters, the show aired on Mondays from April 03, 2007 to September 25, 2007... At 02:30 in the morning JST. Are you joking? We\'re talking about a timeslot where, if you were already into the whole \'mecha\' thing, you would have to wake up at 08:30 AM on Sundays to catch the new Gurren Lagann, then set your alarm...for 02:30 AM Monday to turn on the DVR so you could see whatever this new Idolmaster-meets-Eva thing was all about. Not to mention that if you were more into the cute girls side of the cute-girls-meets-mecha amalgam, then you were already staying up until midnight to catch the new Lucky Star!Of course, none of that really matters now in the age of streaming. I just find it funny that, for one, a lot of young mecha fans probably experienced some very sleepy Tuesdays during the first term of their 2007 school year, but secondly, that it seems that this show has been fighting an uphill battle for survival since the moment it debuted — poor timeslot atop strange adaptation atop stranger romantic pretense atop the fact that the writers were pretty unashamedly cribbing off Evangelion\'s homework for a few of the finer points... and to top it all off, the show has the unfortunate distinction of also being released during the final phase of the transition from analogue to digital animation, giving it a certain style that it seems not many are particularly fond of and certainly didn\'t help in the all-too-easy Eva comparisons. So if any of the strangeness you\'ve probably already read from other reviews is a turn off for you, then this is probably not a show you\'re going to care about in the least. There\'s a lot wrong with this show, and it would certainly be hard to argue that those things are ""good, actually"" in the way so many re-evaluations of older franchises seem to do. But if what you\'ve seen elsewhere (romance? Eva-iM@S?) has peaked your interest enough to read another review but not enough to just go watch the show, let me be the one to humbily point you in that direction. This show is actually really, shockingly good despite what other people seem to think.So if you *are* interested, then I do need to make one very important disclaimer. I\'ve never seen an Idolmaster series before this one, nor have I played any of the games. That seems to be where at least a part of animosity toward this show stems from -> people saying that X or Y character ""wouldn\'t act this or that way in this situation"". I can\'t speak to that. I\'ll probably watch a season of Idolmaster now that I\'m done with this, but if anything, that feels like the more appropriate way to do things, considering that the first season of Idolmaster proper didn\'t air until 2011 (which is another thing this show has going against it — could you imagine being an Idolmaster fan in the mid-2000s and the first time you get to really see these characters shine on screen is while they\'re piloting giant robots? I can only imagine it would be like if the first Project DIVA game ended up being a first person shooter or something! — hilarious and fascinating in its own way, but probably not in the least what you were hoping for).My familiarity with the series aside, what I can say is that 1.) there is an unflinching sincerity to the setting which was both hilarious and engaging, and 2.) that whatever the distance between the characters in this show and their alternate selves from other Idolmaster parallel universes, the characters are good and while tropey and occasionally a bit contrived, gave the show that most important quality of a giant robot show: that I cared a lot more about the individual characters than I did about whatever was going on with the moon or the battles or whatever. Which is for the best, because those fight scenes are not good! But that\'s okay ; it\'s not really what the show\'s focusing on.The setting and set-up to the show are endearing to a fault in my eyes. No spoilers here unless you care particularly deeply about experiencing the first 10 minutes for yourself —> Girl goes to an idol audition, flubs it, ends up getting an offer anyway, moves to Tokyo to join the agency, then lo and behold the audition wasn\'t for BEING an *idol*, it was for PILOTING an *iDOL* - the exceptionally contrived and silly name that they have given to the giant robots which no one in-universe seems to think is the least bit hokey. If you stopped right here for want of a show less -- well, hokey, then I could forgive that. For me, however, it lends an extremely strange sincerity to the show that endows it with this very disjointed sense of humor that permiates through every episode. It is at times a very profound show, asking questions about love and consciousness and what it means to be alive in the world, at times a very strange and silly show where teenage girls get jealous and angry at each other over very superficial things while trying to maintain a normal life and reach their dreams, and at times it is a bewilderingly written show which occasionally throws its hands up, gets bored with itself, and tries to contrive some reason for a girl to put on a sexy outfit. It all feels very goofy and human when it\'s not trying to be serious, and for better or for worse the all-over-the-placeness of the tone (and the tone IS all over the place) makes it feel human and interesting. I felt like I was seeing the world through the girls\' eyes, not really understanding what the potential consequences and stakes of a given action really are -- things swing wildly between a ""fun and games"" sense of abandon and then suddenly crash down to reality and recontextualize everything before it. It\'s weirdly engaging!I can\'t say too much about the characters or arcs without giving away more than I\'m comfortable with, but I will note that, if you\'re anything like me, the first thing that caught your eye about this series was probably the mysterious ""Romance"" tag which seems to accompany this series on some websites but not others. So do be aware: this IS a romance show. The romance element of the show is more important than any of the fights or tragedies, because all those other things just dance around the romance which keeps the rest of the plot orbiting around it with its massive, bizzare gravitational pull. You should watch this show. You should watch it as a romance show -- albeit an unconventional one -- not as a mecha show or an idol show or an idolmaster spinoff. It\'s a weirdly executed, weirdly human, weirdly directed romance show written by people who were really, really into Evangelion and clearly wanted to make something LIKE Eva while exploring some of the other crevaces and possibilities left unexplored by Eva. And it\'s really, really good! Don\'t get me wrong, there\'s plenty wrong with it, but going into that stuff kind ruins the fun and surprise that the series has.Ultimately, after watching a lot of other, newer, better animated, more cleanly written, and -- let\'s be honest -- more forgettable stuff this summer, I came across this weird little show by chance and watched it very hestantly because everyone seemed to hate it. The only positive reviews I could find seem to talk about it like it was a bag of potato chips -> fun in the moment, but ultimately just a cute little snack between heartier meals. I disagree completely! The show is great and completely worth a watch on its own. There\'s plenty bad stuff in there, but good, bad, in between, none of it is boring and I certainly don\'t think I\'ll forget it any time soon barring some unforeseen blunt force trauma.Go watch it, go talk about the good parts and talk about the bad parts, go have a nice time watching a weird, goofy, inscrutable, and deeply human show. And have a good day while you\'re at it! for 02:30 AM Monday to turn on the DVR so you could see whatever this new Idolmaster-meets-Eva thing was all about.

And have a good day while you\'re at it!', ""I'm mainly a fan of mecha anime, so never once did I wish to watch an Idolmaster anime. However, when I became aware of Xenoglossia, I decided to give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a genuinely good mecha anime. The mechanical designs are unique and appealing, supported by supplemental information that lends Xenoglossia more Real Robot credibility than I expected.I understand now that the cast of Xenoglossia aren't original to this anime, but debuted two years earlier in the original iDOLM@STER arcade game. If these are faithful adaptations of these characters, I can't say, but what I can tell you...is that the characters presented here vary between good and great. I can pick out weaker, supporting characters, but I couldn't target any single member as poorly written. The development of the main, pre-existing characters is certainly one of Xenoglossia's strengths.What I can't praise quite so much is Xenoglossia's music. It wasn't outstanding but it isn't bad at all either. There's one or two particularly nice tracks but overall it's simply 'good'.There are two distinct halves to this anime, and the second is more typical of a mecha anime. Whereas the first half is very character driven and devotes most of its time to their development, the plot comes to the fore mainly in the second half. It's an admittedly strange plot but I still found it very enjoyable.Overall, I think Xenoglossia is underrated.  It's truly much better than it appears to be given credit for. I've read that is has since gained some popularity, and I would be happy if it continued to do so from now on. is that the characters presented here vary between good and great.

Seeing the mixed reception this specific take on the series has made me all the more curious to watch it myself and I didn\'t really have too many expectations for it only wanting it to be decent...and I feel safe to say that that is exactly how I ended up feeling about this: it\'s really decent.For the Mondenkind girls (Protagonists) we start with: Haruka, Iori, Makoto, Ritsuko, Azusa, Yukiho, &...Ami. Yayoi is here too as Haruka\'s childhood friend, but made unaware of Haruka & her friends being mech pilots.For the Turiavita girl (Antagonists) we start with: Chihiya.The first half of this show  is for the most part a slice of life. These episodes may be considered slow to most, but they introduce us to the cast and the world so if you\'re here for the characters as seen in the games & the other version of iDOLM@STER you may appreciate it more. We\'re guided by the main protagonist Haruka Amami as she gets baited into becoming a mech pilot under the assumption that she was auditioning to become a music idol (kinda like me with this show) and starts to simmer into the idea of piloting a mech to save the world. We see her developing steady relationships with the rest of the girls clashing with them in various ways, becoming better accustomed with her mech Imber, and understanding the roles she and her friends serve in Mondenkind\'s mission objectives. Every interaction here helps to better serve the 2nd half where the plot starts to become more apparent after meeting everyone and getting a barebones grasp at what they seek to achieve. It does a good job at getting you to like the majority of the cast alongside Haruka by displaying the struggles each face, showcasing their individually view on things around them, and how they choose to act on those areas.Without spoiling anything, plot is kinda strange. Government operation has a secret base of operations hiding in plain sight in the guise of a school where the objective is to aid mechs in destroying with chunks of the moon that fall at seemingly random intervals of time, which is kinda the general gist of why the mech concept is here and implemented. For some unexplained reason they need middle-high school girls to do pilot the mechs and they all develop these odd relationships with the mechs. The mechs are said to have core of which they derive some semblance of human emotion and feeling to a point where they can have brief conversations with as well as understand what the mechs want and feel through what I can only assume to be some odd spiritual connection, and I can\'t recall any explanation as to how it\'s even possible. And going on about lack of explanations,  there are a lot of other things that\'ll happen and never get properly explained from large scale plot details to even some character details and some high-scale level of convenience that you\'re kinda just left to accept it and take in stride without letting downplay your experience by overthinking.From a design standpoint of the whole show there\'s not much to write home about. The animation is good. Character designs are simple but I\'d probably go out on a whim and say I kinda like some a bit better than the more polished versions in the main iDOLM@STER adaptation & revamp. I\'ll even say I appreciate the simplicity of their designs because it makes them feel more natural with the background characters around them. Though I\'m dying to say it: Haruka looks A LOT like Cardcaptor Sakura in the show especially when wearing the ribbons & Chihiya is the spitting image of Misato Katsuragi from Evangelion in general so whenever those 2 clashed it was kinda like watching bizarre fan fiction at play.I\'m a bit surprised I don\'t have much to say about music given the series\' name and all. THE OPs & EDs were all good, the 1st OP Binetsu S.O.S! was fire and kinda catchy, the ED Yuukyuu no Tabibito~Dear Boy was beaufiful in its own way, and the 2nd OP Zankoku yo Kibou to Nare felt like it set the mood of the 2nd half of the show pretty well. There\'s background music AT TIMES and it was simple having fulfilled its purpose while also a lot of moments left to the spoken dialogue of the characters.I was expecting this to be similar to Macross or something integrating mech battles with idols singing, but this is purely a mecha and scarce acknowledgement of actual idol activity and seemingly minimal resemblance to what the main iDOLM@STER series and story should be like. Xenoglossia only seems like it\'s an iDOLM@STER show in name only while just using the characters\' names and just loosely giving meaning to the term ""iDOLM@STER"" in it\'s own way.  As flawed, odd, and unexpected this was as my first foray into the iDOLM@STER series I can\'t say I hated it. Perhaps those accustomed to the standard side of this series may struggle to accept it adjusting to my guess of character deviations and drastic change in setting and tone, but on it\'s own as a mecha anime it seems pretty decent.  As someone who had no set expectations of this to begin with I actually ended up liking this more than I might\'ve thought I would, but if asked if I\'d recommend it...I\'d say if you\'ve got a good amount of patience and can showcase enough tolerance to let this show tell the tale it wants to in spite of it\'s clear-as-day issues.

Jumping,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2211/Jumping,"[""this is exactly as the synopsis says. Tezuka's Jumping is about a boy who goes on a walk, that turns into a jump that just keeps getting bigger and bigger each time his feet leave the ground. oh the  places he goes and the things he sees. there is no story beyond that, but the sounds are kooky, yet appropriate, the art is the same Tezuka we've come to know and love and as for enjoyment, this is a very good way to spend 6 minutes of your life...so many little quirks and easter eggs "", ""Its premise is simple, but what makes this short so engaging is its extraordinary execution. Tezuka, along with a few other rather skillful people, pour in a stupendous amount of effort only to be met with worthwhile results. The visual perspective we see is from a child's point-of-view whilst plummeting and rebounding across several spots. He travels throughout a forest, cityscape, ocean, and, ultimately, an active war field. Although being a Japanese production, Jumping features character designs that have a more classic western cartoon flavor to them, effectively making this short feel moderately more special compared to other anime of the time. Animation moves rather...smoothly for being a short produced with a limited staff/budget during the 1980's. The detail in the line art is very well-rendered, whether it's the minuscule leaves on a giant tree or the intricate, painstakingly drawn windows of an extremely tall building, it's all given considerable attention. The constantly moving, crosshatch-heavy shading also adds some more personality to the already wonderful realistic art. Jumping also manages to pack in a wonderful sight gag, Stars Wars reference, and small, but potent, message regarding war and its undeniably ruinous effects, despite only clocking around seven minutes. In short, this is quite successful in what it sets out to do, and it's one of Tezuka's finest experimental works smoothly for being a short produced with a limited staff/budget during the 1980's.

In short, this is quite successful in what it sets out to do, and it's one of Tezuka's finest experimental works"", 'Even at the twilight of his life and career, the legendary mangaka Osamu Tezuka continued to busy himself with several circulating manga publications, as well as dabbling in animation as a hobby. In fact, there have been accounts of him going out of his way to fund projects with money from his own pocket. One of those instances is with Jumping, Tezuka’s entry for the 1984 Animafest Zagreb, a prestigious animated film festival organized by the International Animated Film Association or ASIFA.Back in 1981, Tezuka enlisted the help of animator Junji Kobayashi, who famously worked on the ambitious animated cityscape scene in Hi no Tori...2772, also a film by Tezuka. Jumping is envisioned to be a grand expansion of that scene—a continuous, fluid short of a child who jumps, jumps, and jumps until he reaches clouds, skyscrapers, forests, and inhumanly unreachable areas, while subtly infusing outlooks on society represented by quick shots of the environments he jumps to. With limited technology, Kobayashi had to think out of the box to be able to acquire reference shots for the short. Unlike Hi no Tori 2772 where he and the animation staff were able to create a model of the futuristic city within the Tezuka Pro office hallway, the sheer scale of Tezuka’s storyboard had led to him hopping on similar roads to imitate the movement, as well as riding on a Cessna plane to take the aerial shots necessary. The result was a six-minute visual wonder consisting of approximately 4,000 cuts (!) made over the course of a two-and-a-half-year long production period.While admittedly not consistently fluid (and at times possibly nauseating), the formidable scope within this short, as well as the fact that this work is produced without any reliance on CGI, is nothing short of inspiring. Within a short amount of time Tezuka crams in as much visual information as possible through each jump, not being overbearing on its gradual shift to disturbing imagery while imbuing in as much meaning as he can. Unsurprisingly, Tezuka would go on and win the Zagreb award, in fact being the first Japanese to ever do so (and the only one alongside Koji Yamamura to win it to this day).Jumping is possibly one of Tezuka’s most nuanced and definitive works. Kobayashi, of course, also deserves recognition for undertaking in this monumental project. This film is one of the many testaments that display the man’s infectious passion for the medium that continues to be felt within the industry beyond his death. 2772, also a film by Tezuka.

Unsurprisingly, Tezuka would go on and win the Zagreb award, in fact being the first Japanese to ever do so (and the only one alongside Koji Yamamura to win it to this day).Jumping is possibly one of Tezuka’s most nuanced and definitive works. Kobayashi, of course, also deserves recognition for undertaking in this monumental project. This film is one of the many testaments that display the man’s infectious passion for the medium that continues to be felt within the industry beyond his death.', 'Osamu Tezuka, “the godfather of manga,” produced a number of influential works that have stood the test of time and uplifted the medium into a status of being a reputable source of great artistic/contemplative experiences.  Disenchanted, however, with the lack of enthusiasm in experimentation within the medium, Tezuka decided to “make something” to prove his worth and possibly win an award — or several.  Hence the production of a short film known simply as “Jumping,” where the viewer vicariously perceives the intense thrill of jumping (via a first-person point of view) through various environments for a breathtaking six minutes.The boundless leaping from one...brobdingnagian structure to the next is immensely thrilling.  But what begins as mere observation and wonder, slowly transitions to an unnerving atmosphere with gruesome acts of militarized intervention which resemble hell itself.  Not all surprising that “Jumping” concludes the horrific journey with a trip to the fiery inferno of hell, giving the viewer an intense juxtaposition between the peaceful atmosphere of privileged, first-world citizens and the wretched habitat of the third-world “battlefield.”Certainly a unique creation by Mr. Tezuka that deserves appreciation and respect.  Modern day directors should look towards the works of the past — particularly Tezuka’s — if they hope to continually push the medium to new heights of creative intrigue. brobdingnagian structure to the next is immensely thrilling.

If you want you can read my review in Spanish.Jumping (1984) constitutes the case of a particular idea. This short simply focuses on a jumping boy. From a subjective point of view, as if we were the aforementioned young man, we observe how a stranger jumps from one place to another. He first begins with small jumps that do not make him advance much, but after dodging a car he begins to jump higher and higher and further. Thanks to this, he makes a kind of trip around the world seeing forests, cities, oceans,...etc. Sometimes, we notice curious or strange facts such as a bird that gets in the middle of our friend's jump, the sight of a naked woman who was on a balcony or the presence of a whale in the sea. They are simple touches of humor to get us a smile.In just six minutes we completed this long journey. At first, the journey doesn't seem to have  meaning, but it really does. For thousands of years, the human being has advanced progressing little by little, as if they were small jumps. But at certain times, especially in recent centuries, this progress has multiplied, making the jumps enormous, impossible to calculate in their distance. It is not surprising that too big a jump can destroy us and that is why it is advisable to start reflecting. The idea seems to be haunting the short film because in one of those jumps the boy reaches a war zone where he apparently dies after the fall of a nuclear missile that destroys everything. In the fall the jumping boy ends up in hell where the devils seem to feel sorry for him and send him back to the finish line. A message in the vein of a mangaka and animator so obsessed with the issue of war and uncontrolled progress.Speaking of other important aspects, this short film draws a lot of attention for two reasons: on the one hand, the subjective point of view that allows the viewer to feel as if he or she is jumping, thus improving that idea of \u200b\u200bthe short; and, on the other hand, the handling of the camera, which allows Tezuka to be offered a view from different angles, something very original on his part and with which he had not explored much until then. However, the work is not perfect. The journey itself is not particularly fascinating, even with those slight touches of humor at work. Anyway, the short occupies a prominent place in the author's non-commercial production.You can read my review here: https://elarmarioanimados.blogspot.com/2020/06/cortometrajes-de-osamu-tezuka-anos-80.html etc. Sometimes, we notice curious or strange facts such as a bird that gets in the middle of our friend's jump, the sight of a naked woman who was on a balcony or the presence of a whale in the sea.

Who knew looking through anime from the 80s would let me find such a breath of fresh air?This short anime, directed by the acclaimed Tezuka Osamu, is about a child that starts walking down the street and has to jump to avoid an accident. After that, he decides to keep jumping and goes higher and further each time.The awesome thing about this (at least for me) is that it is all in first person perspective the entire time. Perhaps there were other anime shorts that used first person before Osamu thought of the idea, but this is the first one that I know of,...and it's a blast to watch. The sound effects add a great deal of enjoyment to it as well.If you enjoy the evolution of animation, or even just want to see all of Tezuka Osamu's works, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this one a watch. It is short, sweet, and worth every minute! and it's a blast to watch.

It is short, sweet, and worth every minute!"", 'This was recommended to me by a friend whom I had told not long before being instructed to wander this rabbit hole out of plaintive desire that I was only into animated shorts now and that I had long worn thin of the longform narrative in cartoons. I sensibly wanted a respite from the inconsolable might the average 12-24 episodes had on my fragile emotional state, and thus didn\'t want to have to deal with any potential long-term investment in established worlds and mundanities associated with ""the continuity"", so to speak. This friend of mine, you see, was a major Tezuka enthusiast. He would collect...supply drop after supply drop of commemorative Osamu Tezuka memorabilia be it autobiographies or secondhand accounts of the man\'s working life through the late 20th century, and at the same time, urge others like myself who could muster an appetite for all things nerdy and secular in terms of interests to read Tezuka manga if only to glimpse the master at work through the lens of a reader living in modern times. Of course, I abstained for the longest time since I was not ready to hop aboard the ""be all end all"" express where the finality of art could be grasped by even the layman. NO, I WAS NOT READY TO FEAST MY EYES ON HIS BODY OF WORK JUST YET. I needed a bit more breathing space before I could.And then it clicked in my head. What if I started not with his written oeuvre, but his directorial craft? That would be conducive for a first-timer like myself, would it not? Heh, talk about a dash of adept decision-making, that one. I decided to take my aforementioned friend up on his suggestion to check out this short after another I\'d already seen beforehand, Broken Down Film, and what a buffet for the senses it was! The editing was supreme, and not to mention (likely) instrumental in the pioneeering and subsequent realization of Satoshi Kon\'s inimitable magic with the camera and how he plays around with the editing in his films. I\'m sure many other industry creatives were inspired by Tezuka\'s work in the early phases of their careers.And now on to the short itself, which i will keep concise and to the point. It is simply a masterstroke of technique. Secondary to the already prominent displays of gyroscopic camera movement which would immediately pass for peer review by academics at the time of its release, coupled with the unconventional angles the pov of both character and viewer introduce whilst mid-air and on the ground, the short\'s defining quality is how attention to detail is NEVER ESCHEWED, regardless of what you may opine quietly by yourself. Denial only results in misappreciation for this particular vision of Tezuka\'s, and how could one not stand in awe at the glory of those towering cityscapes beholden to a regressing society, not one that is privy to change and environmental preservation? All of it amounts to a perfectly illustrated premonition of a future yet to come and everything from its charm to its grievous fixations on death and dysfunction paints a forlorn picture of the human race\'s trajectory at the height of the global economic boom in the 80s.

It may say it was released in 2000, but everything about Puppet Princess screams mid-90s anime excess, and that is right up my alley.

The pace is brisk with a score that's pretty epic, featuring horns that really reminded of the stuff heard throughout Record of Lodoss War.

But don't go into it thinking it'll be on par with series like Ninja Scroll, the Kage OVA, or Vampire Princess Miyu in terms of either fights or beautiful animation. It's got style, but at a fraction, but it's definitely got some things going for it that make it a classic.Animation was alright, and I'm not just saying that for the time this came out. It feels like, surprisingly, despite this OVA being an almost 1:1 shot of the one-shot it was based off of, that the manga did it better....Fights were decent, with cool moments of violent blood sprays accompanied with great choice of music. The final fight was its best fight and most well choreographed. Sound design was mediocre, however, with sound affects for a few of the scenes being a little off.Overall, it's a decent short that I rated as a 5 because it's got one heck of a fun concept and an alright execution. It feels lacking. When reading the one-shot, the art felt more consistent throughout, the darker, thick lines and the scenes flowing better than something that has movement—biggest exceptions being where they barged through the enemy and the final battle, which the OVA completely excelled at.Watch for a quick fix of 90's (despite coming out in the early 2000's) styled anime set Feudal Japan, but keep in mind that it's nothing phenomenal.

Love Get Chu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1070/Love_Get_Chu,"[""So far the only full-fledged story that deals with the life of Animevoice actors, or, Seiyuus (There is REC, but not as dedicated as this one). Despitethe fact that the artwork of this series is of average quality, and thatfiller romance takes up too much time, it does present a lot ofrealistic aspects of the Anime voice acting industry. Highlyrecommended to Seiyuu fans yet do not expect super intelligentstoryline other than how up-and-coming actors(actresses to be accurate)struggle through their green days.Story: 8/10...Mixed with somewhat cliche comedy and romance, what's good about thestoryline is that it faces the true problems of the industry such as commercializationof voice acting and more emphasis on the look of the actors/actresses.Professionals have to move to front stage to cater to the enthusiasticfans curious about other aspects of them that they don't necessarilyexcel at, e.g. singing. The experience of humiliating interview, theheart-pressing training school days, and the embarrassing first-job,etc. all depict the hurting truth in this career: Here talented+diligent peopletake pain with little gain other than small niche popularity. Yet as in mostShounen works, the protagonists managed to find their own positionseventually and started to take off with their childhood fantasy.Comedy elements mostly center around the #1 protagonist Momoko, amindlessly ambitious girl that you saw a lot.

Fortunately, the boy in love also provided enoughinspiration to our girls in focus.With a luxurious 25 episodes, the story is at first pretty episodic, then whenthe romance sets in, it becomes a little draggy,but over the course a lot of character introspection enables us to realizethe &quot;3D&quot; Seiyuu's fear and joy, often obscured by the happy shinny 2D charactersthat they give life to. The ending is very creative in my opinion in that it tries todemonstrate the power of voice acting in a visual fantasy and surely was a lot of funto me. Overall the story works for what it is.An interesting setting: the agency that the protagonists work for iscalled Lamda 8, while in reality, some of the cast of the seriesare signed to the famous agency called Sigma 7. So apparently asemi-pun.Art: 6/10You will see typical Shounen style drawing but the number of colors usedare fairly limited. Good things is given that Seiyuus often work indoors, thereare a fairly elaborated outdoor settings as well. Character faces and bodyfigures are nothing special. You still see the typical big eyes, slim bodyfor example.Sound: 8/10What can I say? Given that this is about voice acting, you getto hear quite a few top-notch actors doing what they do and theyreally mean themselves here! Most of the five female protagonists arenewbies but I really enjoyed 高本めぐみ(Takamoto Megumi)'s performance;it was passionate, cheerful, and sentimental at times. Check outher voice samples on Sigma 7 homepage(http://www.sigma7.co.jp/profile/w_51.html), and you'll probably besurprised how this young girl can be multi-facet instyles as a lot of the older big names can. I'm really looking forwardto her further output (There will be one in which she leads againearly 2009). Veterans such as 三石琴乃, 榎本温子, 若本規夫, 緑川光, all played theirpart properly, as true veterans in the field XD.Speaking of music, there is nothing to &quot;wow&quot; for, though OP would beanther reason to applause Takamoto's talent, where sheproves herself a capable vocalist with incredible energy, voicequality, and vocal range. Another chorus version presented by all 5 protagonists getsput on in the latter half to support the plot and is equally nice.Character: 6/10I get the feeling that this story is more of a showcase of theindustry; a lot of character development should be left with aquestion mark. The #1 protagonist Momoko received much more effortthan the other four, and thus gets to stand out. 落合祐里香 (OchiaiYurika), though received much more attention than Takamoto in reallife, falls flat in her part, and disappeared almost entirely in thelater half. Relatively veteran 山本麻里安, 高橋直純, 新谷良子,こやまきみこ all did well, though no screamer. The other new star坂本梓馬, who has a boyish girl voice, showed extraordinary vocaltalent in the OP version 2, but her acting still has a lot of space togrow.Enjoyment: 10/10Well, as a hardcore Seiyuu fanatics.. I ENJOYED it BIG TIME becauseyou don't really have a lot of choice in the entire Anime history thatdeals with the subject. It's self-contained, fun, and somehowrealistic in the sense of career path in general. I've watched ittwice and strongly feels that I will come back to it again.Overall: 9/10In short, don't get fooled by the art or technical issues. It's amust-have for Seiyuu fans and general audience will learn fairly a lotabout Seiyuu, voice acting, and voice production from this series.

Check outher voice samples on Sigma 7 homepage(http://www.sigma7.co.jp/profile/w_51.html), and you'll probably besurprised how this young girl can be multi-facet instyles as a lot of the older big names can. I'm really looking forwardto her further output (There will be one in which she leads againearly 2009). Veterans such as 三石琴乃, 榎本温子, 若本規夫, 緑川光, all played theirpart properly, as true veterans in the field XD.Speaking of music, there is nothing to &quot;wow&quot; for, though OP would beanther reason to applause Takamoto's talent, where sheproves herself a capable vocalist with incredible energy, voicequality, and vocal range. Another chorus version presented by all 5 protagonists getsput on in the latter half to support the plot and is equally nice.Character: 6/10I get the feeling that this story is more of a showcase of theindustry; a lot of character development should be left with aquestion mark. The #1 protagonist Momoko received much more effortthan the other four, and thus gets to stand out. 落合祐里香 (OchiaiYurika), though received much more attention than Takamoto in reallife, falls flat in her part, and disappeared almost entirely in thelater half. Relatively veteran 山本麻里安, 高橋直純, 新谷良子,こやまきみこ all did well, though no screamer. The other new star坂本梓馬, who has a boyish girl voice, showed extraordinary vocaltalent in the OP version 2, but her acting still has a lot of space togrow.Enjoyment: 10/10Well, as a hardcore Seiyuu fanatics.. I ENJOYED it BIG TIME becauseyou don't really have a lot of choice in the entire Anime history thatdeals with the subject. It's self-contained, fun, and somehowrealistic in the sense of career path in general. I've watched ittwice and strongly feels that I will come back to it again.Overall: 9/10In short, don't get fooled by the art or technical issues. It's amust-have for Seiyuu fans and general audience will learn fairly a lotabout Seiyuu, voice acting, and voice production from this series. Ido hope that there will be more of this kind in the future. But Idoubt it. So cherish the opportunity!"", 'Love Get Chu ~ Miracle Seiyuu Hakusho ~So this is the first all-out seiyuu anime that I have seen. Airing in 2006 in Japan only, I wasn’t entirely sure what I was getting into. I originally wanted to watch this because of the title Love Get Chu….. and the OP that I found. It was enough to make me go “Hmmm, yes this might be fun”.Love Get Chu is about a group of girls trying to become seiyuu (voice actors/actresses). It’s a very coming of age, slice of life, comedy type of anime. The girls that we’re introduced to are not experts; rather, we...watch them become seiyuu from the very beginning, training school. The girls themselves are pretty great, they’re all very different personality wise, but they’re also full of clichés, so if you hate that, this probably isn’t for you right off the bat. We have our super Main girl, the star of the show, the airhead who’s entirely naïve, the natural klutz and the one who is always ready to cheer everyone up; Momoko Ichihara. We also have the shy, quiet and reserved girl Rinka Suzuki, the tomboy Tsubasa Onodera, the observing intelligent girl Amane Oohara and the childhood friend Yurika Sasaki.There is also a male lead, the guy who is a part of a love triangle, the one who wants to become an animator, the filler; Atari Maeda. I call him filler because he’s honestly not needed for Love Get Chu. Most of the time he’s just sort of “there”. Sure there are episodes where he helps Momoko get to know herself better or where Momoko can rely on him sometimes, but by the end of the 25th episode, I was rather tired of seeing him. He’s the childhood friend to Yurika and the love triangle involved Yurika, Momoko and himself.The story in Love Get Chu is that of what I imagine other seiyuu like anime are, but since this is my first time watching one, I have no direct comparison. I think the biggest issue Love Get Chu has is identity. It starts off as a “we’re going to become seiyuu” and “we’re all rivals” sort of thing. Of course by episode 5, they all become seiyuu and the anime takes a turn for the hardships that are included to become one and the difficulty it is to be a really good seiyuu. It then goes into idol territory and tries to bring up some sort of antagonist; at least that’s what it looked like. I can’t even remember his name; I swear his name is only said like 10 times or something. There are these business and political aspects to Love Get Chu which just show up for seemingly no reason at all. If the entire anime had focused on either becoming a seiyuu, idol, or a combination of both, instead of shoehorning romantic elements and some fake antagonist, I’d give it an 8 or more.It’s a little funny, thinking about the way Love Get Chu started and ended, they could be considered different genres really. The beginning has all this great work, lovely animation, great face reactions, super funny scenes and antics between the girls. A little further than halfway through and despair and sad things start to happen, of course it doesn’t last long at all, but my problem is “why”? Why bother having it if you’re not going to expand upon it. Same with the romance elements and things. I’d actually have preferred it if Yurika won Atari; her tactics were slimy and really bad, she took advantage of Atari being drunk and not remembering anything to make him hers. Things like that, which when typed out (and watched too) is 100% dark when compared to the Love Get Chu I watched in the beginning. Like I said, I think Love Get Chu had an identity crisis and just couldn’t figure out how to make 25 episodes of worthwhile content; would have been better off being 1 cour.Art style, depending on how you look at it, could be considered bad or good. Airing in 06, most people would expect something nicer to watch, but I actually liked the very early animated art style. It’s cute, the eyes are extra big, the mouths can get crazy wide and faces are different. The entire aesthetic looks really pretty and the outfits the girls wear, oh my goodness, super cute stuff. If there is one part of the show that I really really liked, it’s the art style, the beautiful bright colors, the clothing, the way the world looks; I loved watching Love Get Chu, that’s for sure.Sound and things: An anime with a huge focus on seiyuu, so the best thing is how different each seiyuu can sound. There is one specific episode that really highlights the powers of a veteran seiyuu, I won’t spoil it, but being able to do 5 different sounding people, that was really cool to listen to. BGM is very normal and nothing to praise, except for when the sadder things start to happen, the change in both tempo and expected music is very stark and different. OP and ED are pretty amazing. The OP is what made me want to watch Love Get Chu, it’s cheerful, it’s super happy and the animation to go along with it is fantastic. The ED, which took a little bit to warm up to, is what I would say J-Hip/hop or something; once the beats drop and the vocals kick in is when the ED shines and makes it good to listen to. It’s also accompanied by Usumaru, Momoko’s keychain mascot usagi doll who dances on screen, so it’s super cute.Over all, I think Love Get Chu is a very good anime, it probably does things differently than other seiyuu shows, since I figure this is a genre that’s hard to really make interesting. The “dark” business and politics of hosting and managing seiyuu is rather unnecessary, but appreciated since it shows some different things. The romance is okay, or more like mediocre; the way Momoko breaks down is very anime, very exaggerated and most definitely not real; the way she handles the truth however, can be very real and that’s a very delicate aspect of a girl’s life to pull off, so good job on that front. 8/10, but only because talking about the art raised it a number. watch them become seiyuu from the very beginning, training school.

I usually expect an anime with a rating of 6 to be either hidden treasure (Futakoi Alternative, Uta kata) or a great idea poorly executed but still retaining memorable features (Geneshaft, Divergence Eve). Love Get-Chu is the latter, but without the memorable aspect.Love Get Chu is the swan song of Radix studio, which like every studio, has at least one undeniable masterpiece that won't be forgotten as long as there are people watching anime:...Haibane Renmei. But it's not a tuneful and worthy one, so it can't even be considered a swan song. In short, it is the story of a group of young girls wishing to become seiyuus. The story goes on well and interestingly in the first half, until episode 14. Then the love triangle involving the main character drags things out and when we finally get rid of it, the last episodes descend to the ridiculous in an insane championship to decide who will play the main role in the most awaited anime in history. If you're a fan of seiyuu and voice acting, the first half involving the slice of life and the whole career description will be pretty good, followed by a bearable ride to the end. If you're anyone else, the first half will be good or decent, and the rest unbearable or dragged out. Interestingly, Shirobako is a mirror image of what Love Get Chu could have been like if it had been performed well. The fact that it's the male lead who declares himself at the end and makes things happen is noteworthy. I suspect that if the show was better realised, perhaps the same story would only need 12 or 13 episodes, not 24 ( the last one is an extra).After that show, Haibane's studio went bankrupt and became Studio Seven, which produced other kinds of masterpieces, but it's still a sad ending and a terrible death.------------Eu não esperava ter de fazer uma review, e como esse show é bastante desconhecido, eu creio que não era necessário, mas eu precisava compartilhar minhas impressões com alguém. Eu geralmente espero que um anime com nota 6 seja ou tesouro escondido (Futakoi Alternative, Uta kata) ou uma grande idéia mal executada, mas que ainda guarda características memoráveis (Geneshaft, Divergence Eve). Love Get-Chu é o último, mas sem o aspecto memorável.Love Get Chu é o canto de cisne do estúdio Radix, que como todo estúdio, tem pelo menos uma inegável obra-prima que não será esquecida enquanto houver gente vendo anime: Haibane Renmei. Mas não é um canto afinado e digno, logo, nem um canto de cisne pode ser considerado. Em resume, é a estória de um grupo de moças desejosas de se tornarem seiyuus. A estória segue boa e interessante na primeira metade, até o episódio 14. Depois o triangulo amoroso envolvendo a protagonista torna a coisa muito arrastada, e quando finalmente nos livramos dele, os últimos episódios descem ao ridículo num campeonato insano pra decidir quem fará o papel principal do anime mais esperado da estória. Se você for um fã de seiyuu e voice acting, a primeira metade que involve o slice of life e toda a descrição da carreira será muito bom, seguido de uma viagem suportável até o fim. Se for qualquer outra pessoa, a primeira metade será boa ou decente, e o resto insuportável ou arrastado. Curiosamente, Shirobako é um espelho de como Love Get Chu poderia ter sido se tivesse sido bem realizado. O fato de ser o male lead quem se declara no final e faz as coisas acontecerem é digna de nota. Suspeito que se o show fosse melhor realizado, talvez a mesma estória necessitasse apenas de 12 ou 13 episódios, e não 24 ( o último é um extra).Depois desse show, o estúdio de Haibane faliu e virou o estúdio Seven, que produziu outro tipos de obras-primas, mas não deixa de ser um final triste e uma morte terrível.

Momochi-san Chi no Ayakashi Ouji,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55998/Momochi-san_Chi_no_Ayakashi_Ouji,"[""I don't usually write reviews, but for Demon Prince of Momochi House, I had to put in my thoughts because this anime desperately needs positive reviews and I need to discuss why this anime really doesn't deserve all the hate and negativity.I read the manga after I heard about the anime announcement back in 2023, I read all 14 volumes and overall I loved it, so my thoughts on this show are based on my perspective as a manga reader. However, for manga readers there is an important distinction to the anime and what I think is its weakest aspect- the anime is not...1:1 with the manga in terms of adaptation. Momochi House really needed a 24 episode or 2-cour run, because it was just impossible to cram 14 volumes into 12 episodes, so this unfortunately is not a complete adaptation. While the anime hits most of the main major plot beats, it also excludes several chapters from the manga, which is a shame but simply inevitable with such a limited run of episodes. This is where most of the pacing issues the show suffers from originate from.Shoujo anime in particular seem to suffer from this problem a lot because of one simple reason- shoujo don't get second seasons. Because the demographic is not as popular in the community and often mistreated by studios, a shoujo manga adaptation has a very low chance of getting a second season or a 24 episode run, so writers have to stuff as much story as they can into a mere 12 episodes, because there's no promise that they'll get another chance. So if you are a manga reader, do be aware that the anime does cover most of the big plot events (no spoilers) but I would recommend watching Momochi House alongside reading the manga or as a supplement to it.Also one other note- this is a character-driven story rather than a plot-driven story. The anime centers around the characters and their histories, experiences, and trauma, and how that influences the story. If you're expecting a mind-bending plot full of massive twists and turns, this isn't for you. However, if you're looking for a story centered around character development and how they learn about each other (and themselves), this is something you might love.I don't really see why there are so many complaints about the animation, it's accurate to the manga artstyle while also being distinct in its own way, it's bright and colorful, the action scenes are fluid, and I love the character designs. The supernatural Japanese mythology aesthetic is quite atmospheric as well.Characters are great, very accurate to their manga counterparts, Himari is a strong heroine that can stand up for herself and get things done on her own when she needs to, Aoi/Nue is NOT a Tomoe clone however much people will spew that, Tomoe is sarcastic/snarky while Aoi is gentle and sweet, and the side characters get their own time to shine as well which is nice to see. The only character I didn't care for was Kasha, even with my experience from the manga, I found him to be a weak villain with flimsy motivations who serves as more of a casual trickster god type villain than a proper antagonist.Music is good, the background BGM is pretty standard, a lot of traditional Japanese instrumentals, the ED is nice but the OP is a total banger, I love it so much and I have it on my personal playlist for regular listening because of how much it slaps.Overall, if you're a fan of the manga, or enjoyed anime like Kamisama Kiss, Fruits Basket, Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi, Natsume Yujinchou, or Spirited Away, I highly recommend giving Demon Prince of Momochi House a watch~ 1:1 with the manga in terms of adaptation.

This isn't a perfect anime by any means, it's a bit clunky, and probably too rushed to give the characters any real room to breathe, but it's an interesting story and a nice romance. Don't let the score fool you, if the title and poster drew you in, you'll probably enjoy this anime. I'm beginning to realize that MAL underrates shoujo in general. An equivalently decent shonen would not be sitting at a 6.4, so keep that in mind.I've seen...a lot of people comparing this to Kamisama Kiss, but worse. I've never seen that anime, so I can't really make a comparison. But I can say it does feel Fruits Basket adjacent, but with much less focus on the characters and more focus on the mystery. Much of the anime centers around the main character's fish-out-of-water situation, how weird it is to finally go to your family home and find it inhabited with weird spirits who won't fully accept you or tell you exactly what's going on. Most episodes waver between hints at an overarching plot and a monster of the week kinda thing. Things would feel much more fleshed out and less rushed if this was a two cour show, but in this day and age just getting shoujo adapted is a big enough accomplishment so ya get what ya get I guess.The strong suit of this anime is definitely the mystery and the romance. Teasing out character's motivations and backstories every episode is honestly pretty engaging, though this only centers on the main characters, side characters are left to the wayside, again, seemingly because they tried to cram so much into twelve episodes. The romance is very cute, grows believably, and doesn't progress like you would expect from the typical shoujo/romcom cliches. The art style is great, the patterned flourishes to clothing and wallpaper are gorgeous, though the animation quality is lacking sometimes (quite a few slideshow scenes that could have been fully animated but weren't). This is probably a personal issue, but if you aren't very familiar with the terminology associated with Japanese spirits and demons you might have a problem following some of the introductions and very brief explanations of the inhabitants of the house. Lots of new names and terms get thrown out with little to no set up or explanations, presumably because the target audience already understands the differences between an ayakashi and a youkai. It doesn't diminish the enjoyability of the plot, but it can be a bit annoying so keep that in mind.Overall, if you enjoy believable romances, mysteries that are slowly solved over a season, and interesting world building, you'll enjoy this show. If you're in it for dramatic, intricate, character growth and lots of well animated action then you will probably not have the patience for this show. 7.5/10 a lot of people comparing this to Kamisama Kiss, but worse.

There's almost really no plot at all? It seems like the show wants to set itself up as episodic with a larger overarching conflict, but we are given no reason to care about either of these elements with how little they have established. This is probably largely in part due to how little the audience cares about the characters at this point in time.Character+Art: 2/10The characters do not have personalities. Their designs aren't even that great either, and the...anime's visuals leave a LOT to be desired. Making the male lead naked every time he transforms is not a personality, and not even attractive.Overall (at this point in time): 2/10The entire time I was watching, I was looking for SOMETHING to be able to complement and enjoy, but there is actually nothing. I genuinely have no idea who the target audience for this is. anime's visuals leave a LOT to be desired.

Impactful scenes will happen so quickly that the character interactions feel inorganic. For instance, there’s a few scenes where Nue goes against bad youkai and struggles to protect Himari. However, this happens so quickly that the scene ultimately amounts to Himari going “No, Nue!!” and Nue finds the strength to beat the youkai. They then feel glad that the other is safe and then the next scene proceeds with little time to breathe. Being based on youkai, there’s a lot of lore to the world and cast, but it’s dumped on the...viewer so quickly that before you can even process what they’re talking about there’s another action or character angst scene.I have to imagine the manga is much better because despite my complaints about the show you can tell that its base concept isn’t bad. I like the setup of the anime and, if taken at a much slower pace, the scenes the characters go through could offer some tense moments and genuine character development.This could have been another okay bishounen romance, but there’s just too much holding it back to enjoy what it’s offering. viewer so quickly that before you can even process what they’re talking about there’s another action or character angst scene.I have to imagine the manga is much better because despite my complaints about the show you can tell that its base concept isn’t bad.

Thanks god I gave myself a chance to completed this anime. This is actually my first time writing review for an anime that should deserve some positive reviews. This anime is highly recommend if you want some slice of life + romance. Because people kept comparing this to Kamisama Kiss, it received so many negative reviews. The anime is actually decent to watch if you want to kill your time. In my opinion, at least the art is better than Kamisama kiss. So do yourself a favor and give this anime a chance...– you won't be disappointed. :) Definitely deserve a second season!

Can’t wait for it 🙂🙂."", 'The Demon Prince of Momochi House - It\'s Kamisama Hajimemashita, but 100 times worse. Let that sentence sink into your brain.Everyone within the AniManga community sure knows famed mangaka Julietta Suzuki\'s Kamisama Hajimemashita a.k.a Kamisama Kiss, if not, then where the hell have you been? It\'s one of the famed Shoujo series that all girls will speak of when they have a classic that they can recommend to, hell even to guys who are not interested in the Shoujo genre, at least for the classics (which I recommend you read/watch the entire series in general). And yes, countless examples have followed this tradition, but not...in the specific sense, which is where mangaka Aya Shouoto comes in with her work of Momochi-san Chi no Ayakashi Ouji a.k.a The Demon Prince of Momochi House. And let me tell you, despite it looking like an imitation copy of Kamisama Hajimemashita, it\'s nowhere near that level. Hell, everything looks like a carbon copy of the extreme bad side of it. And yes, I read the entirety of the already completed 16-volume, 64 chapter series so tell you my overall thoughts as a whole.So first, the story elements of which all characters have their fate intertwined to one mansion where the border between human and the supernatural meets:- The human side: the 16-year-old orphan of Himari Momochi being granted her old family estate as a gift of inheritance. Despite the many rumours going around that the house is haunted, she takes the challenge to reclaim the haunted house as her own, to which she finds 3 handsome guys loitering around in the estate for god knows what reason. As the sole proprietor of the house, she attempts to shake them off her house, but soon realizes that her destiny how lies at the hands of the same 3 Ikemen who warned her about the impending changes/fate within the Momochi House itself.- The supernatural side: Led by Aoi Nanamori, he is one of the 3 entities whom Himari tries to chase out of her House. But the House itself has a hidden secret: the bloodline of the Momochi family must take its reigns and become the next Omamori-sama or ""Nue"", one which Himari was supposed to be as its guardian. But Aoi escaped into the Momochi House when he was 10 due to his family\'s problems when he was a human, and through the goading of an adult who tells him that he would be able to find solace within the House on a hill, there he is unanimously welcomed into the House, and soon realizes that he will become the Omamori-sama instead of Himari, which grants its user spirit-like shikigami powers when he\'s transformed into a Nue.Feeling the Nanami Momozono and Tomoe semblance within Himari and Aoi? Strap on, because things are about to get worse.With Himari\'s Omamori-sama power stripped down to just expelling entities from her own House, she has to settle down with Aoi and his 2 other shikigami lackeys: Yukari, a serving Mizuchi spirit, and Ise, a hard-headed Shoujo-like orangutan. The former is tolerable since he displays a fair expression, and like what he does, only serves his master to the fullest, which he eventually displays that affection to Himari as well, seeing how she is still serving as a co-linkage between her and Aoi as well. The latter is very brash and grumpy, and would bolster trouble even over the most minor things. But when it comes to the crunch, like Yukari, he\'s in loyalty to Aoi as well to drive out beings who dare to disrupt the House\'s dimensions, save for the one who always grates on their nerves: Kasha. The powerful Ayakashi who has a deep obsession and rivlary towards Aoi as the Nue, he is the definition of the boredom character, trying to annoy the heck out of everyone for some amusement.The biggest sin, however, is Himari herself. Though she does give the usual appearance of a main character, it\'s not exactly enforced on her until she gets to the root of the problem within the happenings at Momochi House. And even then, she tries to take charge handling all matters from the wandering ayakashi to the shikigamis themselves, which is nice to see from the authoritarian standpoint of the female MC. The part that feels egregious is the romance section, because since this is a Shoujo, you can\'t exactly run away from Himari and Aoi having feelings for each other even in times of trouble. This is where Kamisama Hajimemashita does this better at knowing where to emphasize character growth that leads to expressive outcomes...wis an irony for the author herself that Aya Shouoto has an idea on where to take Himari\'s character, yet force it down the predictable route when creativity besets her back. Despite the difference between Aya Shouoto and Julietta Suzuki\'s approach of the Shoujo genre, you know who won, and had a better, yet creative approach that doesn\'t betray its themes and knows how to create a natural guideline on long-standing storytelling.Being an Aniplex show, they do have shows that are definitely out of the ordinary like Yana Toboso\'s Kuroshitsuji a.k.a Black Butler. But this is even lesser for Shoujo-centric shows when it comes to the traditional classic Shoujo, which is where this show comes in. The production by studio Drive is just...there, it\'s not the greatest, but it\'s not bad in either way, just mediocre to a low-level decent, avoiding it being a literate imitation of Kamisama Hajimemashita. To make matters worse, director Bob Shirahata isn\'t someone high-profile of note, going through almost 35 years of main roles and assuming directorial roles for the lesser shows, the last notable one being the downfall of Nanatsu no Taizai a.k.a The Seven Deadly Sins via the Ensa no Edinburgh ONAs. I mean, I did not expect much from this show from the get-go, and my feelings were pretty much unchanged from start to finish, with the dip coming off from the 2nd half.The music is decent, with both Ayana Tsujita and Tomoyuki Kono helming the department, they did a fair job creating the atmosphere for the show. The part that I don\'t get, is the theme songs. Muto\'s ED is calm and collected, just like an actual Shoujo work, but Yoh Kamiyama\'s OP is a pure wreck of a disaster. Sure, he can create songs like for instance with Horimiya\'s OP (and ""Iro Kousui"" IS a fantastic song BTW), but ""Hozuki"" sounds too much of a Shonen than a Shoujo-ish song, resulting in quite a dissonance of a song that is just plain bad, or even close to ear-numbing in my terms, yikes.If there is any recommendation after washing off the distastes of the anime, I implore you to read the manga from the very beginning, because Shoujo anime rarely have follow-up seasons and tend to rush to get a stopping point, which this show unfortunately has done so. The manga is quite the opposite approach to the anime and is a decent traditional Shoujo romance work on its own, which I respect Aya Shouoto for her long and arduous work over 6.5 years.Just take the standard word to ""Go read the manga"" and forget that the anime ever existed. in the specific sense, which is where mangaka Aya Shouoto comes in with her work of Momochi-san Chi no Ayakashi Ouji a.k.a The Demon Prince of Momochi House.

I liked the characters but at times they felt very distant to me. I knew that Aoi and Himawari liked each other and that they could not indulge in these feelings but instead of romantic tension sometimes it felt flat. The premise was intriguing but it just didn't get there for me completely and I'm not sure why. The ending was tonally sound but it also felt muted like a lot of the series.Part of the problem was everything felt like it needed to be expanded upon, whether it was Himawari's emotional state, Aoi's past, the ayakashi...all around them, or specific plot points, it felt very condensed in on itself. I think if it took on a broader scope, had a little more tension and drama, and really capitalized on this kind of nostalgic shoujo romance background flavor, it might have been more engaging and closer to a 7/10 for me.If you're looking for a shoujo that is a little subdued but still has some stakes to it, you might enjoy this anime. I don't regret watching it, but it just wasn't as good as it could have been. all around them, or specific plot points, it felt very condensed in on itself.

I was very much here to enjoy a shojo ayakashi rom-com...Except, you can just watch Kamisama Hajimemashita instead.I don\'t know what this story tries to accomplish or what the story is even, it just seemed like a bad copy-paste work of Kamisama Kiss. And that has me sad & angry....At first I was thinking \'well, this is juts an average anime that walks straight behind Kamisama Kiss\', but by the end of it, i knew it doesn\'t.

This review is strictly in regards to the anime so I may be lacking some information in that particular respect.This plot is more akin to a “monster of the week” power rangers type of plot line, making the entire experience boring and repetitive up to this point.The characters are set up in a reverse harem with a young girl surrounded by 3 handsome men.  While this setup has seen success previously, it lacks the comedic punch needed to pull it off.  Aoi’s schtick of saying “Don’t look at me” when transforming and...Himari’s only role of tossing something out consistently makes the experience annoying more than anything.  Himari’s only meaningful dialogue has her saying Aoi’s name over and over again.  You can play a drinking game with it.I am not sure what practical role the other two guys play than as a forgettable peon.To sum up:  In a word…disappointing.

Upon arriving to this house, she discovers however that she’s not the only one residing there… enters Aoi and friends.If you have seen Kamisama kiss, this is incredibly similar. The same can be said regarding fruits basket. They all have: a down-on-her-luck girl ending up at a home full of boys. Then decides to reside with them and help them with their troubles. Even though I actually love stories like that, this one couldn’t stand up to...the other better written plots, and better chemistry between the love interests.Also, I think a big hardship for this show is that the manga came out in 2013, during a time where stories were written differently. Because of this, it doesn’t compete with the new romance animes being released today. It already feels nostalgic and outdated even though it’s technically new. If this had been released as an anime back in 2013, when it was originally written, I think that this would’ve done a much better job with audiences.That all said, I still found it entertaining for what it is.

If you watch 1 episode each day, breaking the suspense doesn\'t really matter.No if you dislike comedic relief, hate Mur Mur, or is short on time....If you continuously watch episode after episode of the anime, you probably don\'t want to ruin the suspense, so you should not watch it.

In these little snippets (usually featured at the end of the episode) she was funny and kinda adorable, but in the real show, I found her annoying and intolerable. I honestly really hated her. However, these clips helped me get to know the characters, so I liked then.There's not really a storyline, if I'm being honest.Next off, the animation was unique. Sometimes it was the regular, once it wasstop motion, etc. The clips all had different things and were pretty entertaining.The sound was alright, though sometimes it felt odd and I wasn't...really digging the music in the background.It really gave us insight into a lot of the characters that seemed so violent in their screen time, especially since it would've been hard to disclose that information in the actual show without it seeming awkward.Overall, it was pretty enjoyable.I would recommend this if you: like the Future Diary characters, want to know more about the characters/their backstories, like Murmur, like anime shortsI would NOT recommend this if you: like keeping a continuous violent/suspenseful aura about you as you watch this, hate Murmur, don't really care about character backstoriesHave a great day everyone! really digging the music in the background.It really gave us insight into a lot of the characters that seemed so violent in their screen time, especially since it would've been hard to disclose that information in the actual show without it seeming awkward.Overall, it was pretty enjoyable.I would recommend this if you: like the Future Diary characters, want to know more about the characters/their backstories, like Murmur, like anime shortsI would NOT recommend this if you: like keeping a continuous violent/suspenseful aura about you as you watch this, hate Murmur, don't really care about character backstoriesHave a great day everyone!""]"
Oi! Ryouma,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8415/Oi_Ryouma,"['My wife, who is Japanese, recommended we watch this anime together as she had fond memories of watching it as a child. I\'m not one to write reviews, but as nobody else has I felt it was my duty to do so - and hope it will be to the benefit of others who stumble across this hidden little gem.The anime covers the Japanese revolution, also referred to as Bakumatsu Period, which translates to ""end of the Shogunate"" - anyone with an interest in Japan will surely want to study that period of time from the history books - but rather than that I would...recommend this anime as one of the best places to start. There is no need for me to delve into the details regarding the historical context or the plotline of what this anime is about - just read the synopsis. Instead I will focus on some elements that stood out for me, and summarise my overall thoughts on why you should watch this anime.Ryouma is not glorified as some all conquering hero as one might see in Western stories - quite the opposite - he is in fact a very ordinary man. It is a typically Japanese trait to be humble and show humility and this anime does exactly that throughout with respect to Ryouma. The story presents his entire life, starting from his childhood, where he was known to have been a coward, a bedwetter, borderline illiterate and unable to do anything properly, to his final days where his independent position enabled him to forge alliances and compromises between Japan\'s greatest leaders allowing his country break free of the feudal structure and towards the more modern interpretation of society we see today. This growth and transformation of Ryouma really gives the viewer some insight into his life, and in particular his relationship with his older sister (psuedo-mother) Otome, who is both the driving force and the rock that supports him during this transition.The presentation is quite childlike, which does not deter from its appeal, in fact I think it makes it more accessible. The art style is simple but genuine, and the likeness of the characters is captured well compared to their real life photos. For the most part the anime showcases the historical events with incredibly accuracy and the characters themselves come across as extremely authentic. There are plenty of humorous moments that punctuate the dramatic events that lead to Ryouma seeking a new world - some of which are incredibly tragic and the anime does not hold back when it comes to the raw and emotive scenes. The brutality of the period is well known. Over and above that through every interaction - be it a Kendo sword fight, an encounter with a foreigner, or protecting others to the detriment of himself -  Ryouma\'s charm and charisma comes across in particular, as he seems to touch all those he encounters which his strong sense of justice and authenticity.Finally the biggest merit to this anime is the amazing research that has been done on Sakamoto Ryouma. It can be legitimately considered an excellent biography, as well as an excellent history book on the Bakumatsu Period. But in contrast to history books and biographies, it does one more thing, it brings Sakamoto Ryouma and his dreams, as well as the time he lived in back to life in a human and relatable way, which is so much more important that knowing some facts about history... You don\'t learn from history by knowing times and events, you learn from history by living through it.[As a word of warning - I could not find any subs for this anime, so it had to be consumed Raw, so you will need some comprehension of Japanese to understand this fully, although given the accessibility of the presentation I would not let that deter you.]Overall Rating: Good, and a must watch for anyone interested in learning more about the events and context surrounding the Japanese revolution and an honest and inspiring presentation of the man that was Sakamoto Ryouma. recommend this anime as one of the best places to start.

One Piece: Cry Heart,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22661/One_Piece__Cry_Heart,"[""One Piece: Cry Heart episodes are 2 short 5-minute clay animations. The first one was about Chopper and Quack Doctor Hiluluk, the second one on how Ace, Sabo and Luffy became brothers.Story - The shorts included the deepest and strongest memories of the past of those two characters, it was effective in helping you remember the saddest parts as it was short but included the most important scenes.Art - It was very different from the usual simple anime style as it was animated using clay. Nevertheless, I found the animation very pretty and enjoyed it more as it was different from the usual style...we were so used to seeing. I also found it very cute as it showed characters younger than they usually were in the main anime.Sound - There was no voice acting whatsoever, the only sound was background music. For some reason, I enjoyed it more as the video seemed more pure and any character's awkward voices could have ruined the moment. The music suited the theme very well and I was glad it was music-only and I knew what the characters were saying from the mood of the music.Enjoyment - I enjoyed even though it didn't make me happy. In fact, it only made me feel sadness but it made me like One Piece even more. The theme, the innocence of childhood, suited the animation, the sound and the timing very well.Overall - I'm grateful that I found it. I found some details in the video from Chopper's past that I had already forgotten since it has been so long, like how Chopper thought the skull sign in the mushroom book symbolised freedom, not poison. Even though I was sad, it made me feel warm inside and I recommend anyone who has already seen Chopper and Luffy's past to see it. we were so used to seeing.

Its interesting to note that Teppei  has a natural ability to being able to play any sport very well.

This series should not be taken seriously, and those who are looking for &quot;real&quot; kendo with a serious plot, I highly recommend you checking out musashi no ken for a better depiction of kendo life. This has some real aspects of kendo, but there are alot of things that simply dont happen in real life.The series as a whole is very enjoyable seeing Teppei and the crazy stunts he pulls on various people throughout the show.

However, only chapter 1 of the VN is adapted and more then half of scenes from there were removed and the rest have been changed completely.STORY: Those who have played the Visual Novel or watched ""Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom"" anime series will see that the base of the story is the same, but that ""Phantom: The Animation"" changed almost every scene. In addition, some plot developments are useless (Zwei being offered his memories back didnt\'t serve the plot at all), we...know nothing about the organisation whom Ein and Zwei serve, not even its reason for existence or why they are opssesed with killing various mafia bosses and a guy called Scyhte Master is here literally a evil genius with his own base with badass monitors and his own personal army.Also, Ein and Zwei are for some reason LITERALY superhuman. While they are supposed to be superior to other people, ""Phantom: The Animation"" crosses the border by leting them ALWAYS fight against armies of enemies and usually kill their opponents with clean headshots while running around.ART: Art is ugly, characters often look different from scene to scene and camera angles that are used screw up the character designs more often then not.SOUND: Soundtrack, OP song and ED song are nice to listen to and are probably teh only good thing in this animeCHARACTERS: Both the Visual Novel and the TV series depend on characters, their developments and their life in their cruel world of crime and killing. ""Phantom: The Animation"" also tries to make good use of characters, but it fails. Their relationship develops suddenly, them becoming enemies is not dramatic at all and they seem like real souless characters about whom is hard to care.ENJOJMENT: If you are not picky and like to watch gunfights, you may enjoj this anime.

Thus leading to the story of this OVA.The story is short and simple; a young man is taken by an organization and being trained by their number one hit man ‘Phantom’. Despite being only three episodes long, the story was well delivered. It was straightforward, sweet, and action packed.The animation is pretty good. The back grounds are well detailed; the action scenes are swift and smooth. However; the character design could use more work. It is not as detailed as the sceneries, which...is the only fault I could find in the animation. Aside from that, everything else was well done.The sound is good, both the OP and the ED are remarkable, in my opinion. The voice acting is good, much better than what you’d expect from English dubs. Even though I don’t like dubs, but I have to admit that it was very well done. The inserted music is quite nice, nothing too awesome and nothing too bad either.The characters are probably the best part of this OVA. All characters are unique in their own way, and you will probably not forget about them as soon as you are done with the OVA. The two main characters Ein and Zwei stands out on their own, they are well portrayed, they deliver their emotions without exaggeration, and we are even able to know more about their pasts. Other characters, despite their brief appearance, are also memorable. You are not going to forget any of them soon.Phantom The animation has action, drama, and a bit of romance. It is a dark OVA, there are not much happy moments in it, and it is intense. All good things to be in a story about hit men. There are no happy moments. All there is is what people have to do to survive and go on with their lives.

There\'s also another adaptation (Requiem for the Phantom) that I haven\'t seen, but I really want to do it now because of this series.The plot is really simple, a guy is kidnapped after witnessing a murder and avoiding a sniper girl named ""Ein"". Later, an organization erased his memories and...he obtains the name ""Zwei"". Now, he lives by killing people while he tries to escape from the criminal life that now he has.The animation here goes really hard. It\'s an ova from 2004, and it has the typical flaws of 2000s animation like some things being really exagerated at some times or other things like bland animation for non important moments, but the series makes up for it with some really well animated scenes for action moments. In sometimes, the animation really feels like the one that we can see in other anime series like Trigun, and that\'s really a good reason for watching this series.Moving on to something else, I loved the characters of this series.Zwei and Ein are a good couple of MCs, they really fit the tone of this series, and the other characters despite not being the most important thing in the world, they will make you feel bad if something happens to them. The series has a really likeable and interesting cast, but because of the length of the series they won\'t have a lot of time on screen. That\'s something that I think ""Requiem for the phantom"" corrects, because that series is like 26 episodes long, 23 more than this one.Ending with the music and themes for this series...Well, they\'re awesome.The opening may not be the best one, which reminds me of Elfen Lied\'s opening, but that one was honestly a better opening. The music that we hear while watching the series is really good, it helps set the tone that the animation wants to show, with relaxing music box sounds in the most of the series, accompanied by more epic songs for the fighting scenes.Oh, and the ending theme... GOD WHAT A GREAT ENDING THEME. ""I myself am Hell"" by Itou Kanako is an epic song that everyone should listen. You should really check it out, even if you aren\'t interested in this anime, it\'s an epic song.

Also, anime or any forms of media entertainment are intended for the pleasure-seeking experience of their audience, and one thing people tend to forget, is that you watch media to explore something new, to escape reality because if entertainment were like our daily lives, then what\'s the point in watching them when we can just live our daily lives?Also, some situations are made that will probably never happen in real life, and people pointing out that “This should\'ve not happened” or “Why didn\'t he/she/it do that” is just stupid because you haven\'t experienced that moment yet so who knows what will you do.So, ""Anime logic"" means logic LITERALLY applied in anime in order to give you viewing pleasure and let you experience a new reality of It\'s own. Because we all know everyday life is boring and laws of physics will never let us do crazy things we want to. It may seem ridiculous or stupid to you, but just realise that it\'s ANIME!"" Heh, spoken like a big-brain dork with a PhD in AniManga.And now, back to Full Dive. The first thing you need to know is that this is by the same author of Cautious Hero, and the most ambitious part is that the anime adaptation was announced just 4 months after the inception of the LN, man, talk about the fastest turnaround time I\'ve ever heard of a source material getting an anime THAT FAST. But if you ask me, the real reason lies with the fact that it\'s the higher-ups at Kadokawa who are to blame, now that the big corporation is pushing source materials under their big and massive source umbrella to adapt and produce 40 anime per year until 2023. That is great for anime fans, but not so much on the ""liturgy"" that is the current state of the anime industry, and if you know anything about it, is that it promotes overwork and stress to the point of real-life death (that isn\'t funny at all).The second thing about Full Dive, is that it isn\'t afraid to be the laughingstock of an imitation of SAO, with the VRMMO-esque feature bundled in, together with the help of series composer Kenta Ihara (who also worked on Cautious Hero) and prominent Seiyuu VAs which had their roles passed onto other people. You know Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, the VA who voiced the chad Kirito, he\'s essentially the one who cleared SAO and many of its VR world derivatives, and now in Full Dive, he has also cleared through this shitty 10-year-old game called Kiwame Quest, which boasts of a literal full-dive RPG...but with realism attached to it so real and shitty that there\'s no indistinguishable difference between the game and real life itself. And now, his playthrough of Kiwame Quest is solely desired by the ""new"" Kirito: high schooler Hiroshi Yuuki (voiced by Daiki Yamashita, OreSuki\'s MC Amatsuyu ""Jouro"" Kisaragi), whom one day, has desired to look for a game that he could play to pass the time of his past accident, and was stupidly roped in to purchase this shitty game from a game shop, managed by the busty Reona Kisaragi, whom is voiced by Ayana Taketatsu, Kirito\'s sister Suguha (well that explains the oversized busty boobs). The new ""Kirito\'s sibling sister"" role of Hiro has been passed onto his sister Kaede (voiced by Aoi Koga), which if by any indication that she has also VA-ed Kaguya and the soon-to-be Komi Shouko, looks to be a spiritual successor of SAO in the sibling pairing. Add in the fact that the ""XL Joushi"" Hentai VA Haruki Ishiya voices the Best Friend trope Martin; Ai Fairouz voicing the yandere Alicia (which is absolutely *chef\'s kiss* perfection) and SAO\'s favourite monster spirit and Silica\'s pet Pina\'s VA Shiori Izawa voicing the sadist Inquisitor Mizarisa, and you have the making of a 100% no-holds barred SAO Abridged version that the pitiful peeing Besto Friendo MC must conquer and find himself clearing the game at a brisk pace (because this is also an SAO trademark). Good luck trying to clear a game that as shitty as it is, you MOFO just have to YOLO this one out with a shitty fairy NPC who makes the mockery out of you both in-game and real life! Isn\'t that such a wunderful premise and with characters so wack you\'d be bulging your eyes out at the complete insanity of it all? YES!? OK, calm down, cool me.I\'ll admit that ENGI still has a long way to go with the studio\'s subpar animation, which are very noticeable with a lot of cutting corners strewn almost everywhere, but the character designs are striking to make up for the lackluster visuals.

Dang those money-shelling shitty corporations!At least you get some fun in the form of the OST, to which music artiste Mayu Maeshima has already made her name known on Re:Zero\'s Season 2 Part 2\'s OP as her solo debut, not forgetting the fact that she was once part of MYTH & ROID, the go-to ""It\'s Free Real Estate, and Ready Perfectly"" outstanding band unit for Isekai shows with banger songs. With her 2nd song ""ANSWER"" for this OP, I just can\'t think of a better OP to represent this ballsy lunatic show. Same with all the female MC VAs (plus a sister) for the ED, with all the IN YOUR FACE butt and boob-shoving and amazing voices, how can you not love a show that knows how to subvert your expectations to just for pure insanity?To finish this review proper, if you still don\'t get my references of endless satire, you\'re just as shitty in real-life, NO QUESTION. Love it or hate it, Full Dive as a show is one that will not be a masterpiece in comedy, but it definitely feels like a spiritual successor to Cautious Hero, IMO of course.An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth? NOPE, this show is the meaning of ""TIT FOR TAT"", a hoodwinked bait to lure you into watching shitty anime that is all bad and low-key good.

I will just delete your message without reading it, so don\'t waste your time.Story (3): I was interested with the idea of the ""full dive"" VRMMO but it is like the creators don\'t know how most MMO\'s start. Does every player in this world get 2 childhood friends that can become AI party members? Because that doesn\'t sound like...an MMO, that sounds like a basic single player RPG. Also why does a pretty much dead game still have servers if the company that handled the services shut down? I just couldn\'t understand how the writing worked here.Art (7): I will say this is probably where the series shines is in its art style. It\'s not the best but the characters are drawn to reflect their personalities, especially Reona. If you are interested in the art then you can probably stick with it better.Sound (6): I never know how to rate this subject so I will give it a 6. The characters expressions come through clearly with their voices and the ending music is rather enjoyable but that is all I can really say about it.Characters (2): alright so this is what probably made me want to drop the series the most especially once it got to episode 4. The MC is just too cringey for me to want to come back and watch him. He had a rather embarrassing mishap during a track meet and now lives as a shut in and social pariah. His whole character is that he runs when things get too tough, cliche but it can work when done right. I personally think this works when the setting is more slice of life than a virtual world where you have to be physically gifted to succeed in it. Hiro logs into this game twice, I wouldn\'t have logged into it after the first time, and it is the second time where he is ripped off, cut, beaten, arrested, haunted, and tortured, to which he then quits the game (any sane person would). But then he goes back in after the promise of getting hanky panky from the other character of the series.Which brings us to Reona, she is either a mega fan or a dev of KQ if she thinks this game is actually good for anyone to actually spend the equivalent of nearly $100 to play it. She pretty much tricks Hiro into buying the game and offers to help Hiro (when she is available to) possibly beat the game and in return she offers to either marry or sleep with Hiro. This game has only been beaten by one person and that person turns out to be a very narcissistic since he thinks people looking for help to beat this impossible game is trash.Enjoyment (3): I was thinking 4 but I can\'t personally see this as ""decent"". I guess if I saw this as more of a comedy, I could get through it but I just don\'t like the characters and the story doesn\'t make sense to me.

One of the biggest issues with this is with the characters. My God, Hiro has got to be the one of the most insufferable whiny unlikable twerp in anime (not the worst, that dishonor goes to Ouma...Shu). I\'m not against the idea of having a loser protagonist, but you gotta make the protag at least somewhat likable in spite of their incompetence. I\'ve hated Hiro all the way through and he never NEVER gets any better. The rest don\'t fare any better, apart from Alicia, Mizarisa and Matsuoka-kun, everyone is so thoroughly unlikable and annoying. It goes beyond ""funny character quirk"" that overstays its welcome, it\'s ""beating you over the head again and again with how much annoying they are and how they never stop"".Then there\'s the humor. The awful humor. It\'s not that they\'re low brow or stupid, again, I enjoyed the stupid dick jokes from Sentouin. The problem is twofold, they\'re delivered by characters you don\'t like, and another one, they overexplain the joke, again and again and again. Yes, we get it the game is shitty because it\'s emulating reality, but my God, they won\'t stop egging you on it. The worst thing is, there are actually good jokes in this ruined by Hiro yelling and overly explaining the joke. Like, there\'s this one pretty good one where, after buying smoke grenades, Hiro couldn\'t use them properly because he didn\'t light them. The framing, the comedic timing, the pauses, everything was great! UNTIL Hiro decides to open his goddamned mouth.Like, for every potential this anime has at being even remotely decent, there\'s a big BUT hovering over it. Like, I like the meta aspects and how it wants to subvert general isekai cliches, BUT, it\'s done in such an overt manner it ruins any subtlety or tact. I like Alicia BUT she\'s barely in the damn thing and she does overstay her welcome. I like that one plot twist near the end of the anime BUT the foreshadowing is so non-existent and it comes so suddenly to the point there\'s no buildup to it. I like having a loser protagonist as a change of pace BUT there is no payoff to him being a loser apart from terrible and repetitive piss and shit jokes.In the anime, Hiro kept on playing that shitty game he was suckered into buying because of tits fairy, and in a meta sense I suppose I was the same for Alicia. In that sense maybe the anime is some kind of success. But most probably it was garbage to begin with and not some clever metacommentary.3/10 Shu).

"", ""I would like to get this out of the way, this is a COMEDY. The biggest complaints come from people who are taking this show too seriously or question the logic in some situations.Story: Our mc, Hiro, goes to the store to purchase the brand new version of a game. Short on cash, he's instead coerced into buying a shitty dead Full Dive RPG game known for being 'too realistic'. Hiro suffers during his quests while playing Full Dive but a portion of the story takes place outside of the game as he logs in and out. The pace so far is slow and steady....There is a dark/serious undertone so some may feel that it clashes with the comedy, personally I didn't mind it. There is potential growth from Hiro due to his backstory and there are lingering questions that have yet to be answered. The timing in addition to the voice acting made the comedy enjoyable. Overall the story is not completely generic but nothing special at the moment. 6/10.Art: I love the art style and colors. It's clean and pleasing to look at. The animation is good but a few times I noticed it could have been better. The character designs aren't really unique but I do enjoy Reona's. 7/10.Sound: The voice acting is superb, the seiyuu's did an excellent job across the board. The OST isn't a stand out but works. The op and ed are catchy. 8/10.Character: There hasn't been much time devoted to the characters other than Hiro. They have been briefly introduced without having much depth. Some may find one specific character unlikable and I think the author did an excellent job building frustration over time until you and our mc has had enough with them. The characters aren't the smartest bunch either. Despite their interactions being entertaining, the 1-dimensional aspect and being a bit generic leads to an average score. 5/10.Enjoyment: I'm having a lot of fun with the slow pacing, comedy, the 'too realistic' RPG setting, and the fact that it has moments outside of the game as well. If you're looking for everything to be logical, have an ultra serious tone, or don't want to see our mc suffer for the sake of laughs, I would avoid Full Dive. I think it's something you turn your brain off, sit back, and enjoy. 7/10.Final thoughts: Full Dive may not be for everyone but as a comedy it's worth checking out.  So far it's excelling at voice acting and comedy; the characters haven't been anything special though they have potential to improve.

Ultimately, I decided I needed to let people know about this show. If you thought this was another VRMMORPG Light Novel cash grab, you would be wrong. This is genuinely a unique anime. Uniquely bad, that is.SA…I mean Full-Dive, is one of the biggest wasted opportunities I’ve seen in some time. Episode 1 grabbed my attention and genuinely had me laughing out loud. I remember commenting in discussion threads that this would be the next Konosuba, and how funny it was. I could not have...been more wrong. As the weeks went by, Full-Dive regressed into a walking meme. In fact, it seemed to be self-aware at times of how stupid its story was. I can confidently say that Reona’s tits literally carried the story and are the only things worth checking out in this anime. The Full Dive video game world that the anime set up was interesting at first, but quickly become repetitive and there’s only so many times the best friend chasing with a knife, or Hiro pissing himself could be used before they got old. Week after week, I watched and hoped that this show would improve, but it just never did. The same old jokes, same old tropes, and an MC who you just stop feeling bad for after a while. For me to not enjoy a show is pretty rare, as everyone who’s read my reviews knows, but this was just bad.Full-Dive’s disappointing story really is a shame, since the studio did a wonderful job with character designs and the art in the show is amazing. Unfortunately, there’s just not much substance there to back it up. I LOVE VRMMORPG, isekai, etc. etc., this was just a very bad example of one.Full-Dive is one of the few skippable shows of what ended up being a really good Spring 2021 anime season. If you just want to get a couple laughs, go for it. If you want an actual good VRMMORPG anime, just watch Bofuri. Full-Dive gets 5 piss soaked pants out of 10. been more wrong.

From the paragraph-length light novel title of this series, you can probably already tell what the one joke is.  Hiro, our main character, is pathetic and cringeworthy beyond belief in real life and the game he tries to play as an escape only piles on the misery.  Usually in a story like this, there would be a little bit of the protagonist being pathetic before growing into a heroic figure the audience can actually find respectable.  Well,...aside from a brief training sequence at the very end of the season, Hiro displays no growth whatsoever.  It\'s pure abuse for Hiro from start to finish.  He loses every fight, he gets mocked and humiliated at every possible opportunity, the girls in his ""harem"" all either hate him or view him as a mark they can squeeze some money out of, and he never comes close to doing anything heroic (or if he does, it\'s misinterpreted as him being a pervert or criminal and he\'s attacked for doing it).  It\'s a little funny at first just how committed the series is to never portraying Hiro in a positive light or allowing anything good to happen to him, but a few episodes into the season, the gimmick starts to wear thin and it\'s just pure secondhand embarrassment at watching him piss himself or get his lunch money taken by in-game bullies over and over and over.If the series had good side characters, this would maybe be a salvageable concept, but they\'re completely flat and uninteresting.  Reona gets the most screentime but she does little besides provide exposition and a few jokes about how greedy and self-centered she is.  Alicia is the closest to having an actual character, the Childhood Friend that is now psychopathically obsessed with killing Hiro after he accidentally kills her brother in the pilot episode, but that doesn\'t really go anywhere and she spends most of her time offscreen because any time she\'s on screen, she\'s trying to kill Hiro.  The other two, Mizarisa the loli torturer/dominatrix and Kaede the tsundere little sister, have such little presence that they may as well not exist, and barely have any personalities beyond those few words I used to describe them.The voice acting is fine for the most part, but the artwork is noticeably substandard for its contemporaries.  The character designs are ugly, with odd-looking multi-colored eyes and vacant, blank looks on the characters\' faces most of the time.  There aren\'t that many action scenes, and they\'re sluggish and not especially well-animated or entertaining.It\'s funny sometimes, there were definitely some gags that made me chuckle, but mostly it just spins its wheels and repeats the same jokes over and over while making the MC as embarrassing and unlikable as possible.  Really the best way to summarize this series is that it\'s a sort-of funny concept that wears out its welcome immediately and has nothing behind it to sustain the premise or make it entertaining once the main gimmick stops being funny. aside from a brief training sequence at the very end of the season, Hiro displays no growth whatsoever.  It\'s pure abuse for Hiro from start to finish.  He loses every fight, he gets mocked and humiliated at every possible opportunity, the girls in his ""harem"" all either hate him or view him as a mark they can squeeze some money out of, and he never comes close to doing anything heroic (or if he does, it\'s misinterpreted as him being a pervert or criminal and he\'s attacked for doing it).

After doing some stupid stuff because he wasn\'t aware of that extremely...stupid concept of a game, he proceeds to suffer through that mess of a game that he can\'t even return because of the shop\'s ""no refunds"" policy.People say this is fun, but I somehow don\'t see it. I only see a person suffering way too long through a mistake instead of just sucking it up that he lost 100 Bucks. I am not enjoying this psychological torture porn. And I see a lot of plot holes as well, because the story feels very forced. Any normal person would have quit the game very soon, yet the MC continues to play it for way longer than is good for him....Do you know the series ""Pitch meeting"" on Youtube? With the running gag ""why?"" - ""So the movie can happen."" ? Because this is the entire plot here.I mean yeah, he does so, so the story can happen and maybe because the shopkeeper is very attractive and offered to play with him, but I don\'t buy it.Well... if you turn your brain capacity to about 60% and ignore those things you actually get a decent story with very dark humour and some really cringy scenes. Not in the way a romcom MC is ""cringe"" but cringe in the way that sends shivers down your spine because the MC is actually suffering.

I wasn\'t really hoping for anything good, but I thought it would all turn out much better. This is the worst spring 2021 anime I have ever watched. But to the point:The story begins 10 years from the present. During this time, the full dive technology has been very well developed. During this time, many VRMMO and VR RPG games have been created. The main character is Hiroshi Yuuki, who after he could not buy his favorite game in the store (because his schoolmates robbed him) went to a small shop...off the beaten track. There he meets the main character, Reona Kisaragi - a saleswoman and owner of this shop. It offers him his favorite game for a lower price than it is in other stores. Our hero pays and receives ... a completely different game, which is ""Kiwame Quest"" - the game is characterized by ... too high realism. Initially, the hero does not want the game, but since no refunds are accepted, the hero must take the one he purchased. At the same time, Reona Kisaragi offers the protagonist to play together ... and this is where the ""comedy"" begins.Exactly, because when there is a comedy, there must also be some jokes. In ""Full Dive"" we can meet them a dozen per episode. Unfortunately, most of them are not funny at all, or have been repeated many times in other anime. Although I must admit - there were really good jokes that I could smile slightly in front of them. Let me also say that the situations that happen during anime are often (but not always) weak or even unnecessary. I don\'t want to give any examples here because I don\'t want to spoil some people. Without some of these situations, the story could have been so much better.The graphics are practically nothing, but still not the worst. As for the music, I don\'t really remember the anime soundtrack, but I can say that the opening is wonderful. Ending is a bit worse in my opinion.Let\'s move on to the character. The main character is ... unremarkable. But it does harem around itself. There is Reona Kisaragi in it, who loves the main character because ... I don\'t know. The creators wanted it, after all, the main character must have some love. Then we have Mizarisa who is a sadist and Alice - Martin\'s sister who was Hiro\'s best friend until he killed him in Episode 1 of IMizaris, Alice and Martin are the AI \u200b\u200bin the game).

So that\'s a warning for anyone wanting to watch this.The story is simple. The p*ssy MC sees this plainly suspicious store out of nowhere searching for a new game where he got scammed into buying a different ""shitty"" game. Then the p*ssy MC, being the pussy he is, agrees to buying it.That\'s the general idea of the plot. And it\'s not bad, just badly executed.I don\'t know anyone who would say that this had good story, and if someone I know says that, then I don\'t know them anymore.To explain why it\'s bad,...it\'s because of how in-to-face it is on being a ""parody"" series instead of being it\'s own. Not saying that parody is bad (I mean, Gintama, my fav. show is a parody so I don\'t really think that parody is bad), it\'s just that successful parody series tends to just use parodies as their one time jokes, and it doesn\'t revolve around the fact that it\'s a parody show.But this anime is literally just a jumbled idea of parody that somehow makes sense even though it shouldn\'t. It both pokes fun on isekai/rpg/virtual sh*t tropes, and parodies them at the same time.Which if done correctly, it would be a game changer of a series. But yeah, just as you think. It\'s bad and it\'s just insulting as a show. It\'s frustrating to watch through because of how idiotic the whole show is. A little spoiler but, you know the whole shenanigans about the mc being bullied? Yeah, that was made into a joke in the last episode which is a slap to the face tbh. It was handled so poorly that I almost stop playing the episode at that moment. So yeah, bad.The characters are also pretty bad. Just plain boring and forgettable.They either exist to be sh*tty characters that makes the pussy MC\'s live horrible, or does nothing to contribute to anything at all.Also, they talk about how this is the most realistic game ever, but I digress. I never seen an anime with characters so poorly done that I actually believed that the goblins are better written than them.And that\'s saying a lot since goblins are f*cking goblins. Like, if your characters are worst than a f*cking goblin, then idk what to say.All of them are so underdeveloped that I don\'t remember anyone that appeared in this anime.The animation is fantastic... in the first episode. But past that and it\'s a slugfest of poor art, boring direction, and bad animation. It\'s an insult to anyone\'s eyes.The music is this anime\'s saving grace. The ost is fine for the most part, but the op and ed are pretty decent. I don\'t mind them.Overall, just a bad anime which is just a cringe-fest that is made for masochists.

But not like those reincarnated into game-like world isekai. This one is more like SAO series with some minus and plus. I\'ll just go straight to the point.Story so far: 4We now have an advanced full-dive game! You can now experience a whole reality inside a game! BUT!! It\'s bad. Let\'s summarize...it first. MC is down and bored, he\'s addicted to playing games. One day he tried a strange game, and immediately made a big mistake. The already crappy game becomes more crappy. Not really the game\'s fault, but mainly his own fault. The reason he bought the game in the first place was already stupid. However, as a young boy, I can tolerate it. Moving on to the ""story development"" The concept is actually good, but the way they execute it is really bad. It could\'ve been good! Like actually good, but whoever made this does not understand the appropriate time to put in a comedy. They keep on putting stupid unfunny jokes in the middle of serious events or conversations. Seriously they do that every episode and ruins every serious moment. Whether it\'s sad, happy, or scary. All ruined by stupid jokes they made. They\'re trying really hard to make it funny and end up ruining the whole thing. Seriously, learn to read the mood mate.Art: 7It\'s good, I like it. Probably the only good thing about this show.Sound: 5Yeah, nothing nice, nothing bad. just mediocre music. Nothing else to say.Character: 31. Protagonist 3/10It starts off well. He has problems and trauma. It made me wonder what made him so? Nevermind. When learned about it, I said ""Yeah, you dug your own grave.""

One day he tried a strange game, and immediately made a big mistake. The already crappy game becomes more crappy. Not really the game\'s fault, but mainly his own fault. The reason he bought the game in the first place was already stupid. However, as a young boy, I can tolerate it. Moving on to the ""story development"" The concept is actually good, but the way they execute it is really bad. It could\'ve been good! Like actually good, but whoever made this does not understand the appropriate time to put in a comedy. They keep on putting stupid unfunny jokes in the middle of serious events or conversations. Seriously they do that every episode and ruins every serious moment. Whether it\'s sad, happy, or scary. All ruined by stupid jokes they made. They\'re trying really hard to make it funny and end up ruining the whole thing. Seriously, learn to read the mood mate.Art: 7It\'s good, I like it. Probably the only good thing about this show.Sound: 5Yeah, nothing nice, nothing bad. just mediocre music. Nothing else to say.Character: 31. Protagonist 3/10It starts off well.

So... this story is supposed to be about a guy who knows about games entering a new game and yet every decision he makes is the most stupid decision. ""Let\'s go apple picking"" ""Nah, I want to go here""...""You can\'t, it\'s dangerous"" ""Oh, so I need to defeat you to go there!""... HOW, do you so idiotically miss such a classic tutorial mission since the beginning?!I was expecting the comedy aspect of the anime to be sort of like Konosuba. But for some reason the ""comedy"" in this is basically just having the most dumb MC in history making the worst possible decision at every turn and then we see the obvious outcomes bite him in the ass. this is not comedy, this is just bad writing. There are constant situations and decisions that look like it could lead to a good story and he constantly goes for the choice that is most obviously going to have a bad outcome, this just kept on taking the enjoyment out of it until I just decided not to give it any more chances and just drop it.I generally go all the way to watching something since i\'m a bit of a completionist but there are some cases that I just can\'t stand. Also, literally came here after the 3rd episode to say how unbelievably awful this anime is but apparently you can only do that after 4 episodes or it gets automatically deleted, which makes no sense because sometimes 3 or less is way more than enough to know something is going to suck.

It\'s actually quite funny and leaves a pretty deep impression.To begin with, I must say this anime is pretty original and the story\'s pretty attractive. True that It\'s pretty similar to SAO or other full dive RPG anime, but it feels a little different. The main protagonist always has bad luck, which leads the story pretty interesting and hilarious. Sometimes It\'s...pretty emotional and serious about the story like ep. 4, which is about his past and it explains everything about him, which explains the first scene of ep. 1. And I really love his past story.For the story, I would give it an 8 or 9 for the moment.However, I think the art, the voice actor, background music could definitely have done much better, It\'s not disappointing, but not attractive either.Overall it\'s pretty hilarious, fun, interesting, emotional, but I would give it a 7 for the moment because the art and sound could be much better. The story itself and the character are great.Many people voted for this anime for 1 or 2, but I think some people are taking the whole anime too seriously.

But in this anime your acquired skills in mouse clicks do not translate into better running.And you cannot login, train martial arts and then log out and be a cool fighter with a biceps size of a football in real life.Therefore, there is a strange psychological phenomena, emphasized in this anime by the encounter with another traveler: if the game is no better than the real life, what is the attraction, why the hero keeps spending time there, why the other character logs in for years just to spend time in prison?I have found my answers watching this anime but I would not spoil it for you.

It\'s meant to be comedic, but all of its jokes just fall flat; I didn\'t laugh once, even internally. The characters are bland. The backstory is non-existent. The art looks washed out and lifeless. There\'s nothing special about the sound. The main story makes no sense when you consider all the facts. And the final nail in the coffin, the Main Character is one of the worst I\'ve seen for this genre in a very long time.The ultimate issue I have with this series is the MC. He is entirely unlikable, has almost no redeeming qualities, and the...""plot"" conveniently ignores key aspects of his backstory for the sake of moving forward. For example, he is just awful at this game; nevermind the fact that he is a hardcore player of these types of games and well-versed in what they might entail. Nope, the basic premise that ""what you do matters"" is just entirely out of his grasp. He has no common sense, is easily manipulated, and he has no introspective abilities to learn from his mistakes. He\'s not altruistic at all and is a complete narcissist.The only redeeming qualities of the series and why I didn\'t give it a ""1"" is found in the character designs of some of the key characters in the story.

There\'s no spoilers hereSo this anime I stumbled across random screenshots on instagram and caught my attention, so I started watching it weekly.People like to point out that it feels like SAO, which I\'ve only seen the first 5 or 6 episodes, and while having seen less episodes of ""Kyuukyoku Shinta"", or ""Full Dive"" as people seem to generally call it, I can firmly say that this anime seems more engaging than SAO; in other words its like SAO but...better, and more comedic, which is why I highly recommend it to SAO fans, both the hardcore and the disappointed ones.Story 7/10: The story isn\'t something outstanding or new that hasn\'t been done before, outside from it\'s original twists in a comedic direction like the fact that the RPG is ""super realistic"", following with the fact that the protagonist is far from a typical OP MC because of the latter. Pretty genereric but not bad. Normally I\'d give this a 6 but considering the non-serious tone of the anime plus the aforementioned original twists, I raise it a 7.Art 8/10: The art is vibrant and colourful, with a good balance of tones depending on the scene. The character designs are charming even for the ugliest characters. It is such that even background characters can also have coloured hair and eyes, breaking the annoying old meme/trope of ""try to find the main characters"". I rate it 8/10 because I\'ve seen better/more worked animation in other works.Sound 10/10: The OP is a bop to headbang, and as a musician I\'ve immediately added it to play on my sets. The ED is very different but danceable in it\'s own way. Don\'t normally rate this but I give it a 10/10 cause I\'m easy to please in this aspect.Character 6/10: The characters aren\'t specially unique writing wise, there\'s currently higher standards even for comedy anime on how unforgettable a character can be in their charm, however none of the main characters are appalling or annoying or at least in my opinion. There\'s not much character development, since it\'s not exactly a thriller but the little it has it\'s well executed. I\'ve only seen 4/12 so this might change.Enjoyment 9/10: This is one of the few anime I come back to every week this season that I genuinely enjoy, wether it is because its comedy, mere curiosity and/or the artstyle combined. As someone who loves anime I don\'t regret watching this.Overall, I\'d say it\'s between Very Good, and Good, since again, hardly anything is done wrong here. If you\'re looking for a serious story this might not be the anime for you, but if you just wanna have a good time and relax, this is a great recommendation, and I recommend it even more if you loved the premise of SAO but were disappointed with its execution, or just want something similar. better, and more comedic, which is why I highly recommend it to SAO fans, both the hardcore and the disappointed ones.Story 7/10: The story isn\'t something outstanding or new that hasn\'t been done before, outside from it\'s original twists in a comedic direction like the fact that the RPG is ""super realistic"", following with the fact that the protagonist is far from a typical OP MC because of the latter.

I'm not quite sure where all the negativity is coming from towards this series as I found it quite clever at times and honestly a refreshing take and comedy on the oversaturated Isekai/Fantasy genre.During my time watching the show I actually found it to be quite funny, playing and making a mock of commonly found Isekai tropes such as an overpowered mc, automatically love-struck sexy neighbor girl, and strong childhood friend.

Overall the show also has pretty good comedic timing and I found myself laughing at a few jokes that were made throughout the show.Another aspect of the show that I found pretty solid was the character flaws that existed in reality (pre-MMO/ isekai thing) didn't just magically disappear and become solved when he entered the world, which allows us to actually see real improvement in the protagonist as a person, you'll see when you watch it.TL;DR: In my opinion, this show is honestly quite fun and will probably be slept on due to its Isekai/Fantasy genericness but I think under the hood It's a bit of a gem and refreshing, so in my opinion, just go watch it, you'll probably enjoy it as long as you don't take it to incredibly seriously, and just enjoy it for what it is.

To escape the tough realities of life, he finds comfort in the world of virtual reality gaming. But everything changes when he discovers an old, forgotten game known for being so realistic it blurs the line between virtual and real life.What happens next is a fascinating look at the human experience as our hero navigates this virtual world without any magical powers or divine help. His progress relies entirely on his own cleverness, resilience, and ability to grow. It's a refreshing change from the usual...stories we see today.What makes this story really stand out is its originality. It's not the usual isekai where characters get transported to other dimensions, nor is it about being trapped in a video game. There are no overpowered heroes here; instead, the story focuses on the protagonist's inner journey, his struggles, and his victories as he deals with the complexities of his virtual life.Plus, the storytelling is top-notch, drawing viewers into a richly detailed world full of nuance and depth. The artwork is also amazing, blending traditional and digital techniques to create stunning visuals that really pop.In summary, this series shows the power of storytelling in the digital age. It's a thought-provoking look at identity, morality, and the nature of reality.

Working 9 – 5 (or returning from school) just to then go on a quest to kill a demon lord would probably not end well. This also seems to be the core muse for comedy in this anime.Notable: The dark comedy present in this anime suited me very well but might be off-putting to some people.Disappointing: Main character often feels...like he is just going with the flow, almost trying to melt in with the background, avoid conflict or just give up (can’t say I blame him though, the first time he tried to stand up to this RPG world and fight against it got him an interesting Title).Obvious: I can see the anime has a lower score and I can understand why, if you are not a fan of this type of comedy it turns into a standard everyone-beat-up-the-MC anime which there is plenty of out there.Why the score: Don’t remember when was the last time I saw dark comedy in an anime which seems to be my favorite comedy type. It really made a good impression on me. I guess if you don’t laugh by the end of the first episode you might not enjoy the rest as much as I did. like he is just going with the flow, almost trying to melt in with the background, avoid conflict or just give up (can’t say I blame him though, the first time he tried to stand up to this RPG world and fight against it got him an interesting Title).Obvious: I can see the anime has a lower score and I can understand why, if you are not a fan of this type of comedy it turns into a standard everyone-beat-up-the-MC anime which there is plenty of out there.Why the score: Don’t remember when was the last time I saw dark comedy in an anime which seems to be my favorite comedy type.

I'm at episode 9 now and he barely gets any development.They don't help him in any way, and when they do it's because of their own strange reason.He could've quit the crappy game ages ago but didn't because of the plot armor.The other MC reona never helps and instead keeps making fun of him. most other characters are quite standard what you see in most anime.The only reason i keep watching is because reona is hot and pretty in her game outfit. without that i would've dropped it way earlier.ENJOYMENT: didn't enjoy it because of the characters and the story. only enjoyment i had was reona's outfit.OVERALL: i would give it an 4. it could've had a lot more potential despite what the title says. all in all i will watch it till the end. but i doubt the ending of this season will be any good background isn't bad eitherCHARACTER: This is the main reason i wanted to write a review: The characters really sucks.The MC made 1 mistake and he never deals with it and runs away from it instead of confronting it.

The game is 'dead' because of how difficult its supposed to be, that the company that ran it shut down (But the servers are still up?) And has a small but very dedicated playerbase. The game is interesting  in that every NPC is like a real person and the MC is just the...same with no particular outstanding attributes apart from he can run fast. There could be a lot here but it doesn't extend past that and falls completely flat as he may as well be isakai'd into the game as another NPC.Weak characters can be actually more interesting but it was handled awfully, and could never find a reasonable mix between what the show wanted to achieve, trying to be serious while also having the 'comedy relief' pixie that follows him throughout. His actions and backstory are not interesting, and who knows what reason the author/artist/animation team decided to give him an appearance almost exactly like Kirito's with a family almost the exact same. Same with Mizarisa's design being very close to Milims in reincarnated slime, what was the reason for obviously copying the design of her, same twin tails, red pink hair, OP, black finger nails etcThe MC's reason to keep playing the game makes no sense either, until he's effectively sexually persuaded by the shop owner who is clearly a moderator/dev/ or otherwise as there's no real reason for her to follow him around. It would have been infinitely more interesting if she was also a player in the game and/or was the polar opposite of the MC in that her character was actually strong, but instead remains a passive follower that the game world literally cannot see.I tried hard to keep going with this show all the way up to episode 7, it's really not worth it and I hope the author does decide to play some MMO's so he can actually improve his storys. same with no particular outstanding attributes apart from he can run fast.

I have no clue how you can ignore all the blatant problems this show has, and if you find this funny, I think something else is wrong.The basic idea behind this show is, lets throw the MC into the pits of hell and somehow he\'s gonna come out the other end like ""I have been enlightened and...I shall actually try again at life.""There are other examples of MC\'s being thrown down like that but all of them turned into badass\'s when their backs were against the wall. This MC? NOPE! He just runs away or gets saved by plot armor only to eventually get someone else\'s poor excuse for help and suddenly has an epiphany about actually being nice to people.  Now dont get me wrong I know this isn\'t supposed to be a power fantasy with another overpowered MC but that doesn\'t mean you have to go full opposite with a completely moronic and useless MC that gets run around by everyone and refuses to ever take a real stand. Any normal human would have let the stupid console explode instead of being subjected to the kind of things this MC apparently starts to enjoy???I thought the addition of him talking to a classmate about the game was a breath of fresh air. Like... at least someone on the outside of this hell can maybe shed some light on this darkness. Maybe pointing out the MC\'s stupidity or showing some sympathy and encouragement to this idiot. ANYTHING. Instead he\'s just there to smile and wave. There is one real point where I got my hopes up and he actually picked up on ""OMG this game sounds like shit"", but instead of telling the MC to stop, he says, ""You seem happy"". LIKE WTF. If he\'s happy playing this game that has put him through literal hell... I think there\'s something wrong.  There is way more wrong with this show like his family and the people he\'s come across but I think you get the picture.Overall I must say, very, very disappointing.

Right now I\'m trying to decide whether or not to keep following this show or just cut my loses and drop it in favour of something better. For some stupid reason, I put it upon myself a while back to start watching all the isekai I could get my hands on. To try and find the mythical scratch for the itch. This show is not that. It\'s a shame because some ideas here are really quite interesting—A realistic rpg with consequences for player actions, a title system reflecting deeds done in-game, value to npc lives...with rich backstories and the potential to develop depending on how the game is played or how the interactions turn out. Unfortunately, this series suffers from insufferable main character syndrome. Hiro (get it?), our protagonist, lurches from moment to moment in a predictable and boring fashion kicking and screaming the whole way. The cycle goes like this event, cowardice, screaming, ""why is this happening?"", ""This is not like rpg games I\'ve played"". ""No, it\'s like real life"" (only its not because the world is scripted, arbitrary and contrived). Now repeat. And repeat...I actually get annoyed when I watch this. I hate Hiro\'s character, not only is his look bargain basement generic but so is his personality. As I say I just finished episode 5 and so far he has had no character development to speak of and reacts to every situation the same as he did in the first ep. He has very little of anything to endear him to me at all to be honest.Reona is potentially the only reason I may have even got this far and yes it\'s only because of the fan service—Her character suffers from insufferable support character syndrome. Giving out information after the fact so we get the annoying comic ""Doh!"" moments, instigating conflicts and generally literally keeping the MC from quitting the world entirely. It\'s like an analogy of what she is doing to us the viewer, I know that I can quit anytime but ""Why not give it one more go?"" she says. Her influence on me has everything to do with looking like a fairy stripper, and nothing at all to do with her personality. Because she has none. As a shop owner (or at least working the cashier in this game shop) she pressures the MC into buying the game for a lot of money, brags about it, then just tags along with him everywhere like she has no life of her own and is totally fine with spending all her time dressed as a stripper fairy in the company of a school boy online. We know why she is there, they don\'t hide it, in fact they flaunt the fan service every chance they get. Which is probably for the better because it\'s the only spice going on.To be fair it does have a few good moments, but the main let down is the MC. I have no connection with him at all, he has no goal or drive or ambition, he doesn\'t even really have a reason to be in that world in the first place apart from being cajoled into it. I don\'t even know why I wrote this to be honest, watch it, try it out, form your own opinions. I needed to express how aggravated this anime made me feel.

TBH, I would have prefer a couple of panty flashes form her rather than seeing her in that S and M outfit.Verdict 7 over 10Sound:Pros: You can feel the MC\'s struggle, frustrations and other things that don\'t go well, with the MC. and I kinda like Mizarisa\'s ""Sheeee, shee, shee.""Cons: I hate both opening and closing theme.Verdict 8 over 10.Character:Pros: Ok we have one of your typical loser named Yuki Hiroshi, who has been wanting to get a game program for a long time, problem was, 2 bullies were asking for some money from him, not having enough, he found some store in some remote place and buys an alternative game program, typical that he has to encounter a white haired lady with big boobs and a hot body...and as we know, the moment the guy buys some crappy game, that\'s where his problem begins.....now, who was this Yuki Hiroshi, well given that he\'s stupid, where a guy like him already has a opportunity to make it big in athletics, decides to make a 380 turn from being a hopeful to a loser cu\'z one simply thing that has embarrass him was his inability to hold his pee.....Reona Kisaragi, IMAO I think she was one of those who develop that crappy game, but then again, she wasn\'t much of any help, maybe just a little, but then again her being with the guy as this small fairy that only the guy can see who basically act as Cheerleader/adviser/ associate , now I don\'t know about you, but to me she was still useless.Cons: Reona Kisaragi, pretty much useless, her only used was being an eyecandy.Verdict 7 over 10Enjoyment:Pros: Really this was something that was well worth it.cons: Nothing at allVerdict 8 over 10Overall:8 over 10Well worth it, I say, so season 2?????

Ans: Hold your horses, studio ENGI should think twice, cu\'z this anime IMAO, was just as good as a single season.....', 'TLDR at the end :PThis anime pursues the ultimate real-life experience... so it says. This anime is very niche and that is important when considering watching this. If you are reading this as someone who hasn\'t watched it yet, be prepared to watch someone go through *admittedly way more extreme* real life hardships and the lowest of lows that you can get.We start off with our main character, Hiro who loved running, but due to an accident he ended up becoming a shut-in loser. By the end of this season, you see Hiro learn and grow up in this real-life world. The enjoyment comes from...watching the character you once thought was just a loser and idiot turn into a much more respectable person and may even start to like him a little more. Now, I personally loved Kamui (the one voiced by Yoshitsugu in the subbed version) as my favorite character here, but you will find out why if you watch it through.The whole story develops to complete this redemption of a guy who is a loser, depressed by an accident, who ended up shutting himself in to play video games (sound familiar?), but eventually must go through the hardships of life but actually in a video game. The concept is relatively overused, but when considering the smaller details it is genuinely a very unique and interesting plot. The story does not immediately change him into a great person and he becomes the King of Monsters because he got some insane power from being isekai\'d, in fact, it is clear that he isn\'t anywhere near being finished developing by the end of the anime. We definitely see growth, but as the entire story isn\'t even near finished, he obviously hasn\'t even finished becoming what we hope he might end up as. *Hence why a season 2 would be nice :)* THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT THE END OF THE STORY, so don\'t treat it like the story is over and he has to already be great :)I don\'t have much to say about art and animation, it is good animation quality and the character designs are pretty much the same throughout so if you don\'t like this design you won\'t like the art, but if you liked it like me then you will like it :) *However it isn\'t on a movie level or Violet Evergarden, so don\'t expect some Leonardo Da Vinci stuff lmao* The fight sequences seemed to have quality enough animation, but since these animators probably got paid slave wages for this, I definitely say this was good quality lol.When watching the Trash Full Dive anime, sound effects, the OST, and the OP/ED combo, each one is good enough to fulfill its part. The OST is very good in important parts, as they often helped to compliment the mood and tone of the situation, and the sound effects make the anime seem much more realistic. I would even go as far to say that the seiyuu for this anime are realistic too. Often I don\'t even consider the seiyuu because usually they are about as good as the anime, but in the Trash Full Dive anime, I thought it would be some average run-of-the-mill, watch on the side while I do homework, anime. However, the seiyuu for this anime feel very genuine and live up to the ""ultimate real-life experience."" Now, you could probably disagree with that, but beyond just having a voice that fits what type of character they are (the village knight having the deep hearty voice, and the loud troll Darkness mimic having that higher pitched annoying voice (self diss, I have a similar voice :P_)), each voice fits exactly as I would expect someone\'s expressions to be in the situation they should be in which is what makes the sound very good.In my opinion, each character from Reona to even some random bullies you see for maybe a grand total of 3 minutes are important. Each are important to the growth of our main character. They each shape the character he is at whatever given time, or at some times they are simply there to highlight where he has grown. However, even characters who seemed like they would only be there for a chuckle had some growth, and that is what I found beautiful about it. Now of course, there are still some characters who are just annoying and are consistently annoying throughout the anime. I think I just have either a different sense of humor and it was meant for another audience, or it just wasn\'t funny, but either way, all characters being funny isn\'t my only make or break for an action comedy.As for enjoyment, this was the hardest one to rate. I am not one who usually enjoys watching a main character suffer or get completely and utterly *pardon language* shit on. This isn\'t even an understatement seeing as the whole anime centers around the main character being in a game where it mimics that real life has incredible hardships and speeds it up to push the person playing to become a better person to survive in the real world better. For most others, enjoyment comes from their mood when watching an anime, however for me most of the time, it comes from some expectations when watching it. If most people watch an anime and  come out excited after watching it, it wins. If they come out and think, ""What the heck did I just watch,"" then it sucked. Simple. With me, if I expect an anime to be some deep melodrama or expect it to be some fun happy funny full dive game anime like SAO, where there is some sort of plot, but no real hardships and get this anime, I don\'t enjoy it as much. I for sure felt enjoyment in watching this anime, especially after episode 3 or 4, because I finally got used to the fact that this anime is definitely no SAO. Do not go into this anime thinking it will be some light hearted happy comedy where everyone stays all flowery and blushy because it simply isn\'t that kind of anime.TLDROverall, this anime was very solid with the art being consistent and the sound being enjoyable. When you consider going into this anime, if you only want a more light hearted full dive game anime, go watch something else lol. Expect to see the hardships of life and the growth of a loser who may one day (if we get another season or two) actually become a ""Hiro"" ;) watching the character you once thought was just a loser and idiot turn into a much more respectable person and may even start to like him a little more. Now, I personally loved Kamui (the one voiced by Yoshitsugu in the subbed version) as my favorite character here, but you will find out why if you watch it through.The whole story develops to complete this redemption of a guy who is a loser, depressed by an accident, who ended up shutting himself in to play video games (sound familiar?), but eventually must go through the hardships of life but actually in a video game. The concept is relatively overused, but when considering the smaller details it is genuinely a very unique and interesting plot. The story does not immediately change him into a great person and he becomes the King of Monsters because he got some insane power from being isekai\'d, in fact, it is clear that he isn\'t anywhere near being finished developing by the end of the anime. We definitely see growth, but as the entire story isn\'t even near finished, he obviously hasn\'t even finished becoming what we hope he might end up as. *Hence why a season 2 would be nice :)* THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT THE END OF THE STORY, so don\'t treat it like the story is over and he has to already be great :)I don\'t have much to say about art and animation, it is good animation quality and the character designs are pretty much the same throughout so if you don\'t like this design you won\'t like the art, but if you liked it like me then you will like it :) *However it isn\'t on a movie level or Violet Evergarden, so don\'t expect some Leonardo Da Vinci stuff lmao* The fight sequences seemed to have quality enough animation, but since these animators probably got paid slave wages for this, I definitely say this was good quality lol.When watching the Trash Full Dive anime, sound effects, the OST, and the OP/ED combo, each one is good enough to fulfill its part.

I believe that good character developments compose good stories, this anime is a typical negative example.The main heroine is well and truly annoying, I hate her from the first glance I saw her, what she does is a pure fraud which should not ever be funny. Her attitude against everything is so irritating...as well, she even laughs when the main character is suffered because of her. Unlike those big evils in other animes who have ambitions, the only motivation I could possibly come up with is that she enjoys watching people suffering.The main character is bland and stupid as fuck, he literally never improves and he is driven by his penis I would say.  \u200bThe first episode is cool and the second episode is not that bad, but the show becomes worse and worse as it proceeds, and eventually becomes a sheer pain to watch. I just can't watch the next episode because I know I have to learn English to make a comment here.Generally speaking, this anime is apparently the worst anime I have ever seen including something like ousama game. This anime literally grieved me and makes me tilted. The only reason I give it a 2 is because of the first one or two episodes, but don't move further if you cherish your mental health. as well, she even laughs when the main character is suffered because of her.

It’s quite good. Outside that however? Not that big a fan of this show. Maybe over time with more time spent on character development and such I could get into it, but I was just so uninterested in this show.I think this show sort of fucks around and does so little for so long and per episode that by the time that maybe it’s getting better, the season ends. Maybe fans of the source material enjoy that but I just could not deal with the humor or plot stuff.

Unfortunately it falls short in execution.The main character, Hiroshi, is not likeable. The show really drills in that he is a loser and the viewer must put up with his whining through the entire run. Side characters are equally painful to deal with. Each is almost entirely defined by a single quirk... and they are not entertaining quirks. The only character I actually liked was Alicia. I don\'t know why, as I still hated her yandere stick - which is the focus of most of her screen time.The...story is ugh. The setup forces Hiro to act illogically. The flow is good enough and can keep your interest. However, many parts are painful. The payoffs are not worth it and the interactions you want to see will not happen. After watching, it feels like I was dragged through a painful experience intentionally designed to torture the viewer.Seriously - I think this show was purposely made for masochists. It constantly dangles that carrot, making you think things are going to improve. But, it will always return to its stated theme of ""this is a shitty game"".

Despite it being a generic ""VR isekai"" anime with a realism plot twist-filled with cliches/tropes galore, it has a certain charm to it, a new take on the old that in my opinion is very enjoyable.The story is a bit all over the place, but honestly, what really makes it for me are the interactions between characters. Interactions between Reona and Hiro have made me burst out laughing a few times and these two are really the dynamic duo of the show. Each character is basically an archetype taken to the extreme, but it\'s done in a way where...each character has their own standing within the show that differentiates them from the rest, e.g., Mizarisa and Alicia, both are crazy but very distinct in their own ways.The MC, Hiro, is at times irritating with the decisions he makes, but in the context of certain situations, a lot of them actually make sense. Hiro isn\'t some OP shonen protagonist (the last episode begs to differ), so he often has no choice but to go with the flow of events. I honestly quite liked how they depicted his past trauma as a reason for his meekness, it adds another layer of motivation for the MC to work harder and improve. I appreciated the character development of Hiro (although it was rushed), whereby in the beginning he\'s bothered by his past trauma but eventually moves past it and finds his own reason to keep going.Everyone\'s complaining about the side characters and their motivations, i.e, Tesla, Mizarisa, Alicia and so on. However, what they forget is that the show doesn\'t revolve around them, it revolves around Hiro and how he deals with them.Despite the last episode literally turning Hiro into some OP shounen protagonist, I was thoroughly satisfied with the ending.

Perhaps I'm too generous, but this one's getting a six overall in spite of its very blatant flaws.EDIT: I'm editing this to test something."", 'Whenever I rate a show, I start at 5; which in my mind, is a cookie cutter show, that is about as average as average can be. I then move up or down accordingly so as to give the show a fair chance in its own right. It\'s not a perfect system, as I will likely not bother watching a show 4 and below. But it allows me to review each anime on an individual, one to one basis.This show is inconsistent in its quality. Not it\'s art or production quality, but rather whether or not the author wants to make this series one with...a relatable underlying life lesson to state - Or simply a generic throwaway isekai, where the protagonist is a pushover.Essentially the moral of the story the writer wants to convey is to push yourself, even when things in life seem hopeless - Which is a great message to have. The problem is, the writer doesn\'t consistently stick with this message throughout the overall character arc. The main character will have moments of bravery, overcoming a challenge of some kind, and seemingly experience character progression in accordance with the plot - Only to immediately revert backwards when faced with the next challenge - And he reverts *hard*.I actually think this character regression ""Whiplash"" is the show\'s fatal flaw. You\'ll have moments where you can relate to the main character, only to be shown just how pathetic he really is, and it immediately pulls you out. They go too far in some areas, and it metaphorically digs itself into a hole.If they make a season 2 of this show, I\'d actually watch it, because it really does have its moments, and I\'d like to see where it goes. If they would focus more on building the main character up, rather than constantly dumping on him, I think this could be a pretty decent series. a relatable underlying life lesson to state - Or simply a generic throwaway isekai, where the protagonist is a pushover.Essentially the moral of the story the writer wants to convey is to push yourself, even when things in life seem hopeless - Which is a great message to have.

Everything feels uninspired, it is just another typical isekai with no qualities to set it apart from the others, it\'s just boring.Story: 2/10Like I said, it\'s just another typical isekai with no originality. The anime just feels like the second half of Sword Art Online, but without any of the things that made SAO a...classic, such as animation or music. It seems like the main character has some serious plot armor as well. For instance, in episode 7 when the goblins attack, they are moving lightning fast and chopping off arms faster than the eye can track, but then when they attack the main character, they\'re nice enough to swing so slowly that even the pathetic main character can dodge them.Art: 3/10Not bad, not special, looks kind of stiff and uninspired like everything else in the anime but it\'s not offensively bad. It\'s essentially the bare minimum of what is expected of anime nowadays, or maybe a little below the bare minimumSound: 4:10Soundtrack is forgettable, the op is the only notable track, if only it were the op of a much better anime. There aren\'t any other songs that stand out. There\'s music, but you barely notice it and you\'ll forget about it as soon as it stops playing. Just like the rest of the anime, it\'s the most bare bones, generic, minimalist soundtrack you could imagine, like the creators searched ""royalty free music"" on youtube and they used the first 4-5 songs that popped up.Character: 1/10Character is what this anime does the worst. Every character has one trait that makes them kind of unique, and then their entire personality is an embodiment of that trait. The characters are so basic, I can\'t even call them one dimensional, that would be too generous. The main character is stupid and pathetic, with little to no backstory or redeeming character traits. He is constantly picking the dumbest possible option despite what much smarter people tell him, and treats it like the only option. He\'s so stupid he could get tricked by someone even if he could read their mind. At first I thought that if the anime gave him decent motivation, he could be an alright character, but then they give him the worst motivation I\'ve ever seen in a main character. When he wants to quit the game, the motivation they give him is that he gotta beat the game so he can marry the obnoxious scammer with big boobies. As a side note, those boobies are so big they don\'t even look good anymore, they just look ridiculous and stupid. The love interest, as I just mentioned, is obnoxious and she looks ridiculous, and she has zero personality.It\'s supposed to be a comedy, but I don\'t think anyone could laugh at this show, the comedy is just the main character being stupid and someone takes advantage of him in the most predictable way, then the mc screams cancerously, rinse and repeat for every episode. Either that or mc forgets that the game is realistic for the fifth time that episode and so he ends up looking pathetic. The funniest part of the anime is that he escapes being executed by one character because he was so pathetic he somehow wet himself and they laughed so hard that his executioner wanted to be his friend. If that doesn\'t make any sense, I\'m sorry, that\'s just what happened.Overall: 2/10I went into this with no expectations thinking this was just another isekai, and i was still disappointed by it. Overall, uninspired and boring, would never recommend to anyone with good taste. 2/10 may be a bit generous, it\'s easily the worst anime of Spring 2021 classic, such as animation or music. It seems like the main character has some serious plot armor as well.

Not in a good way. Maybe you could think of it as a dark comedy but the jokes don\'t really hit like that. My biggest problem from what little I did see was the MC. You loose all empathy for him by the fact that he plays the game more than once. He screams, cries, and feels miserable in the game and each time I\'m just like ""Yeah serves you right,  what did you expect?"" The reason he gets ostracized during his adventure is so realistic. They...could\'ve made it more comedic but the punishment for his crime was justified. Usually its a misunderstanding or the MC gets framed, but no it should be go to jail game over.I just lost interest in watching anymore. I\'m not into torture porn. could\'ve made it more comedic but the punishment for his crime was justified. Usually its a misunderstanding or the MC gets framed, but no it should be go to jail game over.I just lost interest in watching anymore. I\'m not into torture porn.', 'Wow I did not like this show.My rating started at a 6, and then worked its way down to a 4 before dropping to a 3 for the ending. Here\'s why I think this show is horrible:[spoilers]First off we have the quick things to criticize. Artistically this show is pretty ugly, the faces are strange, the character designs are ugly, not much good to say. The style as a whole also looks very generic, with scenes from this show (excluding any shots with people in them, as that would make it obvious) I don\'t think I\'d be able to distinguish this show from most other...fantasy setting shows. So yeah, pretty bad in the art department.The soundtrack was pretty ok I guess, nothing memorable about the ambient tracks, if there were any. I honestly can\'t remember. The ED was pretty bad and can be pretty much summed up as ""noise."" There was also some really weird sound mixing going on with the final fight scene. The OP was actually pretty good though, so some points there.The story of Full Dive is pretty bad. A lot of fans argue that ""its a comedy so it doesn\'t need a story"" and I agree with them, for the most part. Comedy shows don\'t necessarily need a story. Joshiraku and Nichijou are perfect examples, they have a very non-linear structure and basically no story, instead soley focussing on the characters and the jokes. Full Dive is not like this. It has a linear story-based narrative, and unlike Joshiraku or Nichijou, it doesn\'t really have the comedic substance of those show\'s episodes to make up for the lack of a good story. It can\'t both not need a story and simultaneously be story-based. This leads to a large portion of the episodes feeling really dull and boring, the ones that don\'t are basically the first episode (since its introduces the entire show and feels sort of fresh), the ending fight scene, and any of the REALLY bad parts.The story itself is pretty bad overall, although not appalling. The main problem I had with it is me being annoyed at the inconsistencies with the world, but I\'ll talk more about that later. Second to that was how stupid everything is, things happen without a whole lot of great motivations or setup or anything. Why is Hiro continuing to play this game when he knows that failing will cost him tens of thousands of yen? He gives pretty much no reason or motivation, other than his sister telling him that he should stop giving up on things. wow. Great explanation. Why does Alicia randomly protect Hiro? Because she gets a dream where Martin tells her to forgive him. When exactly did this dream happen? It clearly was not right before she saves him, as she was standing right by him when Tesla gave his evil guy monologue, and it doesn\'t make sense for it to have been before then, considering that she showed little to no interest in protecting him during the goblin raid. He immediately gets separated from his team and who finds him and saves him from that random goblin? Not Alicia, its Marzia. She never is like ""Hey Hiro sorry for trying to stab you earlier I understand that Martin\'s death wasn\'t your fault,"" during the raid. The only things that she does that are indicative of this dream ever happening are in the scene where its mentioned. So this basically means that she must have been snoozing through Tesla\'s monologue and quickly grasped the situation herself after awakening. Amazing. Almost like this scene was added solely to give Hiro some motivation to beat Tesla and keep playing even after he loses, as well as a sorry attempt to create an emotional scene with this character nobody would ever get a strong attachment to.There is also the reasoning behind Hiro\'s general wimpy personality, his ""dark past"" if you will. Before anybody says, ""but that was clearly just played for laughs!"" I have seen people unironically call the stupid track pissing seen a ""deep"" backstory that explains the inner psyche of the MC, so to some people, it clearly was not just a joke. This is just dumb, there isn\'t anything more to it, its just dumb and not good. Which is a pretty good way to sum up the story as a whole, ""dumb and not good.""Another big story gripe I have is the ending. The ending of a show is important, and as shows like ERASED show, its important to not rush them, and to take great care when crafting the ending. ERASED\'s ending is regarded as quite rushed, compressing a bunch of the original story into just one episode.Full dive compresses it into a third of an episode.It\'s incredibly rushed, and pretty bad, much more so than ERASED, and also for different reasons. I can understand Hiro wanting to get back into the game at this point. He\'s invested in the game now, he was somehow moved by Alicia dying, and he was soo close to beating Tesla. But the ending just feels so rushed, a million different things happen at once with basically no development. What was that weird dream scene with Kamui at the end? I have no idea and the show provides no answer. The entire ending was horribly rushed and feels like 2 episodes compressed into 7 minutes of runtime.Ok now onto my MASSIVE gripes with the worldbuilding, setting, and the inconsistencies with them. This show constantly talks about how ""realistic"" KQ is, and won\'t stop talking about it. But it\'s really only realistic when the writers feel it would be funny or dramatic to be. Its plenty realistic when they need the main character to have to pee or whatever, but then Tesla will be surprised when his ""gold"" sword breaks. There are so many instances of this its hard to count. Another one is the apparently super in-depth NPC\'s right? Except Alicia goes serial killer mode for absolutely no reason, amazing. The other NPC\'s are also pretty 1-dimensional characters, pretty easily summed up with one or two words. Extremely state of the art. I\'m also really confused about magic in KQ, considering the massive deal they make out of how there isn\'t like a magical heal thing in the early episodes, it makes it seem like magic isn\'t really a thing. And then ghosts become a thing, and then Tesla comes along with his magic lightning sword powers, and then Hiro gets a magic sword. The inconsistencies are so prevalent, and kept taking me out of the show and really making my experience that much worse. There is also the weird inclusion of ""stats"" which I find strange, I feel like if this game really was so realistic it wouldn\'t need stats, it would just keep track of things like the characters knowledge and physical makeup. But nope, it uses stats. The main gimmick of the show is that its an ultra realistic full dive RPG, but most of the time you wouldn\'t be able to tell. Even that gimmick isn\'t that unique, its honestly pretty easily comparable to SAO\'s alfheim arc.Now humor is subjective I\'ll agree, but you can still categorize certain kinds of humor and associate them with certain groups or demographics. And a good portion of the jokes in Full Dive feel like they were written for a 4th grader. 2 or 3 of the episodes in particular (specific numbers escape me atm) are just a constant barrage of pee and poop jokes. How amazingly clever. Not all of the humor is like that, but I certainty found them to be the same level of not funny. There was 1 time where I did chuckle, which was when Kamui referred to Reona as having ""Holstein cow tits"" which I really only found funny because of how absurd and on the nose it was.So yeah, that was my extremely long review about why I hated Full Dive. In short, its really bad SAO that tries to be funny. Don\'t watch it. fantasy setting shows.

We start with Hiro, who pissed his pants at a running tournament under pressure. Because of this, he has basically thrown his life away, school, social etc. When he does not have enough money to buy the game he wanted, he ends up at a crappy game store where Reona seduces him into buying some random game, which was the first full dive game.From here on you get an adventure where in the end not much happens, he makes some progress in the game but thats about it....The plot is weak and that was noticeable from the start, there is no back story and not really a clear point to which you are working to. In fact, the end goal of the game is to kill the demon lord (i guess, not sure) but at the end of the series he hasn't even left the city yet. So the plot is also really slow.The characters really aren't special either, you have the MC Hiro, who has a habit of pissing himself, there is no character depth here. You have Reona, who wants Hiro to finish the game so she can marry him, and why? Because the first player who cleared the game rejected her. Then there is Alicia, the sister of Martin, both childhood friends of the character in the game. She wants to kill Hiro because he accidentally killed Martin. Then you have a saw wielding maniac, who gets Hiro to piss himself again. All of these are nothing special and lack real depth.There are some positive points to the anime though, the art was pretty decent and the comedy in it was quite good as well. The common misconception here is that this is supposed to be a serious isekai, but its more a comedy. If you can get over that, the anime is still quite enjoyable.TL:DRMan with habit of pissing himself tries to clear a realistic game but gets nowhere in 12 episodes The plot is weak and that was noticeable from the start, there is no back story and not really a clear point to which you are working to.

Also first review. Yay. I definitely think this anime has an audience but I don't think it is for me. I can say I definitely want to finish it but I can't say I am fully enjoying it. Hopefully I can make it clear in the review.Story (6): I think the game's plot is very interesting. A game that is so realistic that it literally makes you feel like you are in that world is interesting. Hiro, our main protag, is tricked into buying the game and learns about how harsh it is and seems...to ALWAYS choose the toughest route without knowing it. Not a bad story but I feel his reason for playing the game isn't strong enough personally but more on that later.Art (8): I love the animes art style and I think it is what is mostly keeping me interested in coming back to each episode. I love how some scenes convey how Hiro is depressed with dark scenes and how Reona is light and energetic with bright scenes. Well doneSound (7) the sound design is good too. Characters sound very believable to reflect their xpressions and the ending music is probably my favorite thing to listen to after each episode.Characters (5) I feel this is where the series is at its weakest but they are interesting enough to bring me back. Let's go through themHiro: a down on his luck protag who runs from every problem he has ever faced is tricked into buying a bad videogame and ends up always choosing or causing the worst case scenario. I would have liked him more if he was playing the game to make himself a better person but I think he is only playing for the game store clerk that tricked him, Reona.Reona: She is very energetic and either loves or hates this game but for some reason wants Hiro to play and beat this game. If he succeeds she promises to marry or have some kind of relationship with Hiro. It isn't clear why she tricked Hiro into buying the game but it is what makes me interested in her the most.They are others like his sister (Kaede), his virtual childhood friend (Alicia), and his visual torturer (Mizarisa) but the story is mostly focused on Reona and Hiro.Enjoyment (6) like I said this isn't exactly for me but there is enough to make me at least want to finish it but I can't say I can see myself coming back after it is done.Overall=6 to ALWAYS choose the toughest route without knowing it. Not a bad story but I feel his reason for playing the game isn't strong enough personally but more on that later.Art (8): I love the animes art style and I think it is what is mostly keeping me interested in coming back to each episode. I love how some scenes convey how Hiro is depressed with dark scenes and how Reona is light and energetic with bright scenes. Well doneSound (7) the sound design is good too.

The ultra-hard mode VRMMO concept with some interesting plot bits serves as a decent framework; however, the characters, specifically the MC, have recently become a frustrating aspect of the anime, to say the least, lowering the overall score for me. More information below.**Minor Spoilers Below**Story 4/10: The plot so far doesn’t have a lot of draw or logic behind it. Basically, a socially inept and traumatized lad gets baited into trying a dead VRMMO. The appeal to learning more about the game itself isn’t really focused on compared to the immediate...predicament the MC found himself in. Considering we’re in EP 5 and the MC barely got his name cleared, the pacing feels very slow. My morbid curiosity and completionist trait are pretty much only why I’m still here at this point. I’m hoping that more information about the VRMMO itself is revealed soon.Art/Sound 7/10: Tracks, sounds, and animation all are good. Everything is as you’d expect. Nothing particular sticks out for me.Characters 3/10: Originally, the MC stuck with me as relatable and decent. As of the most recent episode, I’ve increasingly grown to despise him, and he is my main point of contention in this category. The MC has moments of common sense but since then has become painfully inept with little development. His inability to learn and adjust his approach to the game despite being a seasoned VRMMO player and receiving help from an experienced player is unbearable. I’d think after getting worked over, he’d at some point reflect and harden, but I guess since they’re hitting the comedy tag, it’d be fun to have him continue to set himself up for a truly shittier experience. Hopefully, things pick up, and the MC develops into a better character instead of getting constantly beat down. Considering his current progress, I won’t have my hopes up.Lastly, this is more or less my mid-season review. In the end, I’ll update and adjust based on the whole series.

Here our not so intrepid hero suffers the effects of his early mistakes until almost the end.  He whines and snivels constantly while bumbling his way through the first challenge with a couple of babes who stick with him not out of mindless adoration but because they want to alternately torture and/or kill him.  Unfortunately all this fun trope busting comes to an end in the finale where things turn pretty formulaic; but that only puts a slight damper...on the first 11 episodes of awesomeness! on the first 11 episodes of awesomeness!', 'I\'d give this a solid 7.5 rating. It\'s good. It doesn\'t deserve to be rated below 7 on MAL imo. Also, the storyline is strong & full of unpredictable twists in every episode. So overall, it was still very entertaining.This anime is being criticised for the \'not-so-good\' comedic timing/voice acting. And I agree, if the at times unnecessary screaming by the voice actor was not there, the anime would\'ve been even better.This anime needed better voice acting, like in the anime-""So I\'m a spider, so what""-where the voice actress completely carried the anime with her comedic timing & skills.But as someone who hasn\'t...seen the LN/Manga, this anime is still pretty enjoyable.

Hence, a good watch.', '[This review is spoiler free!] TL;DR: Full Dive does very few things well, and where it succeeds doesn\'t make it entirely worth watching. It tries to say it\'s not like other anime while being exactly like other animes. It\'s unique enough to be a trashy show you\'ve likely never seen before.On the surface, Full Dive has a lot of potential. It has a unique premise and follows a slightly-above average character. The MC is an indecisive high schooler who has given up and embraced the world of video games; I\'m sure many of us can relate to that. In this sense, you can\'t help but...want to root for the MC. But he has too many unlikable traits (in my opinion), making it almost unbearable to watch this show. I found myself skipping through episodes--not because I thought it was cringe--but because I thought the MC (and the supporting character) were unbearable. I laughed in the first few episodes, but the initial joy and curiosity of starting a new show quickly wore off by episode 4, and I was left with 8 more episodes of a subpar anime.You\'ll see many people saying that this show isn\'t meant to be taken seriously and is just a comedy--but when did comedy mean poorly written? There is an element of comedy, no doubt. This show pokes fun at the SAO style of VMMORPG and Isekai genre. It leans heavily into this idea of being a ""realistic"" VMMORPG. You can feel pain, taste the food, get fatigued, and log out! With that in mind, this concept of ""realism"" is just a thin veil to hide the author\'s poor writing and lack of creativity. It feels like the writer had some ideas but couldn\'t think of how to get from point A to point B. Because of that, you have entire episodes that feel forced, and once you pair that with poorly timed zingers, unlikeable characters, and no actual plot, you\'re left feeling annoyed and disappointed.Full Dive succeeds at subverting your expectations and creating exciting plot twists. But at its core, you\'ve seen it all before: you have the weak MC who crawls through the series with the power of plot armor; an annoying but ""lovable"" supporting girl that acts as a mentor and potential love interest; the obsessive and overpowered childhood friend that follows the MC; and a sadistic girl who wants to cause the MC pain. Each element by itself /has/ the potential to be something extraordinary, but Full Dive fails to deliver anything meaningful.The only episode that is truly worth mentioning is the final episode. Without spoiling anything, the MC finally becomes something other than trash and shows us something worth watching. Although it seems extremely forced compared to the rest of the show, episode 12 is almost enough to make Full Dive worth watching. Had the show spent less time on being different and built on the elements that made it unique, Full Dive could\'ve been great. If you want to watch this show, I\'d recommend episodes 1-5 and then skip to 12. Watching episodes 6-11 was dreadful and unpleasant, and I can\'t blame people for dropping when they did.Rating: 03 ❁.

I was expecting this series to be sub-par given the horrible 6.5 rating but I am genuinely surprised how much I\'ve enjoyed this series. Yes, I\'m one of those oddballs that actually don\'t agree with the reviewer\'s consensus.Everyone complains how the series lacks any plot or how the MC is nothing less than a pathetic fool but if you follow the idea behind the series, it completely makes sense. The series runs on the idea that the VRMMO is so realistic, it mimics that of real-life and so just like...in real life, a weak person doesn\'t instantly become strong after fighting a couple of mobs, and uses his/her experience points to level up their character. Nope, this series follows reality much more closely in the game world.I think everyone who got a bad taste after watching the series was due to being let down on how they didn\'t expect the age-old cliches to pop up throughout the episodes. If you watch this without those expectations, it\'s much more enjoyable. If you follow the logic, it\'s really about the MC\'s IRL persona improving due to trial and errors he\'s experienced from the game.Once again, I genuinely enjoyed this series. It exceeded my expectations and I loved the slow (more realistic) pace on character growth. The slap-stick humor is pretty spot on even though sometimes Reona\'s character is kind of tone-deaf. The series applies IRL logic to the VRMMO game logic and it brings a sense of realism to each ""event"" Hiro has to triumph over. This is one of the reason why this anime intrigued me so much. Watch this series with the expectation that this doesn\'t follow the age old VRMMO cliche and I believe you\'ll enjoy it as much as I did. in real life, a weak person doesn\'t instantly become strong after fighting a couple of mobs, and uses his/her experience points to level up their character.

In the real world you can quite easily notice how colors seem more bland and grey-ish to represent the rough times the main character experiences, while in the game world although it can also be rough it\'s full of new and interesting experiences that can even help in their own strange ways. The character design is quite something...else to speak of but there are many interesting designs I can go a bit more into laterSound: I\'m not too much of a sound guy so I\'ll just say that it was mostly good and nothing wrong, from you fun sound effects to your more gritty or interesting ones they were there and helped make the anime what it is.Characters: There is a healthy amount of character you get to experience in this story but I\'ll start off with the MCHiro: Hiro is a fairly normal type of guy with some unfortunate things happening in his life, he acts fairly appropriately but still has a bit of that MC drive that keeps him going which is nice to see. It was refreshing seeing a character like this even if it\'s a bit awkward to get used to at first.Reona: The ""heroine"" of the anime, Reona is the character that truly starts the whole story going. I\'m not even sure if I would call her horny bait as her breasts are so egregiously big that I would say it creates the opposite effect... but that\'s just a personal opinion. Her character creates an interesting dynamic throughout the entire anime with the MC that you appreciate in a strange way once it\'s finally over. You\'ll get a good laugh from her every now and then as you enjoy the show.I don\'t want to spoil the other characters too much so I\'ll be general with the others.Although some side characters feel important they might not actually get much screen time which is a shame, on the other hand they do fulfil the roles that they need to still.  You might be disappointed with some things but I think one of the more important things to look at is how fun some of them can be, including the incredible difference in Z axis for some of themStory: The story is actually quite a simple one, a sad boy with a rough life just want to get a new game, unfortunately this didn\'t happen as the store led to Reona who pushed the full dive rpg game onto him. Although admitted shitty Hiro still pushes through the game and keeps at it trying his best to complete the game.Enjoyment: A great time to watch, especially with a friend. It\'s easily enjoyable on your own or with a friend as you can just lay back without too much though put into it and watch the fun unfold.Overall: 10/10 a great show to watch for an experience you will have a ball watching.Closing thoughts: Although full dive rpg might not be what you\'d except, it\'s something you should still consider watching anyways. Will it be a perfected masterpiece of though provoking things? Perhaps an animation masterpiece, or even an emotion rollercoaster. All of these I\'ll have to say no, but I did have a good time watching it and hopefully you will too. else to speak of but there are many interesting designs I can go a bit more into laterSound: I\'m not too much of a sound guy so I\'ll just say that it was mostly good and nothing wrong, from you fun sound effects to your more gritty or interesting ones they were there and helped make the anime what it is.Characters: There is a healthy amount of character you get to experience in this story but I\'ll start off with the MCHiro: Hiro is a fairly normal type of guy with some unfortunate things happening in his life, he acts fairly appropriately but still has a bit of that MC drive that keeps him going which is nice to see.

To put bluntly, if you\'re a longtime MMO player and gamer like I am, and you play titles like WoW, League, and other ""not great/anymore"" games living in communities such as those, you\'ll feel right at home with Full Dive...RPG as outside of the not-too great but redeemable MC, the younger sister that has a proper relationship with her brother (which is rare in anime btw), and the on-the-nose yet still well-written generic childhood friend NPC character, Full Dive is full of character tropes and archetypes you\'ve come to know and love along with subverting them.

VR is a fun gimmick until your gamer knees start to give out from having to stand for the first time in decades.

It\'s the exact reason I hate the Sims, or any simulation game, really.I thought the show had it\'s comedic moments. I like how they had him kill off his friend and then just leaned really hard into it instead of that being a one-off joke. I like everything about the prison torturer girl and every scene she\'s in. The childhood friend fruit-slicer was funny. But the walkthrough thing he kept going to made no sense.

I dunno it was a mixed bag. It was entertaining to watch, though so I give it an 8/10 piece of shit imaginable. All in the name of ""realism.""And it\'s true that to some few special people the pinnacle of good game design is making the graphics and gameplay as true to life as possible. Motion controls were all the rage and seemed like they were going to be the future until people realized how much they missed just being able to sit on the couch and push a button. VR is a fun gimmick until your gamer knees start to give out from having to stand for the first time in decades. The truth is that games are fun because they let you do things you can\'t normally do in real life. It\'s the exact reason I hate the Sims, or any simulation game, really.I thought the show had it\'s comedic moments. I like how they had him kill off his friend and then just leaned really hard into it instead of that being a one-off joke. I like everything about the prison torturer girl and every scene she\'s in. The childhood friend fruit-slicer was funny. But the walkthrough thing he kept going to made no sense.

If anything this anime is more in the line of RE:Zero though admittedly not as good though there is potential.some of the next may be considered spoilers.The show sets up to tackle some deep issues. The MC faces bullying in real life and attempts to escape a shit life in a game which turns out to be well even shittier. Not only does the bullying cont in the game but its a fantasy setting like any game with all the pain and tbh a title system that takes away from...the anime.The characters in the show are.. interesting the MC dealing with his stuff though hasn't had too much progress though recently he has started working through them and growing a back bone. The NPC's are fairly well done and show where this show could really flourish as a psychological horror show. You have a psycopath, a perfect example of a yandere, a government conspiracy, and other things that would lend well to an darker anime. Again the show suffers from the lable comedy.Overall I don't think this is a bad show. It's not a great show but it is worth a watch as long as you don't go in thinking your gonna laugh alot. the anime.The characters in the show are.. interesting the MC dealing with his stuff though hasn't had too much progress though recently he has started working through them and growing a back bone.

This show is hands down one of the most horrible shows that I have ever encountered, I can\'t tell if it\'s satire or not but nothing makes sense from the characters to the plot to the dialogue.  I mean if you want to have some random anime running in the background this can be it because nothing happens so you won\'t miss anything even if you look away.  Other than that, it\'s just a below-average ""isekai"". ', '[NO SPOILERS REVIEW]Honestly, I don\'t understand why the rating is low for this anime because when I watched this, it was very entertaining and quite different than the typical VRMMO-themed anime.At first, it seems normal but there are a lot of plot twists and the story of the main character stays true to the real world. Unlike the usual ""isekai"" anime, the events are unexpected and the build-up of the story is amazing. The characters are realistic in a  way that you can be attached to them.Lastly, if you want to try this, please do, because it has a lot of potential. ', ""This anime is a must see!!Is a mix of all the things that i like in an anime.It has the VR concept of SAO, the unfair world of KONOSUBA and the comedy of ORESUKI.Story: 10The development is pretty slow but the comedy compensate.Art: 6the only weak point of this anime iyam...Sound: 8Don't get me wrong, the sounds are basic but do his work well (btw i love the OP and ED)Character: 10I laughed in all the chapters (when you think the serie is getting serious but Reona appears)people tend to compare one anime with another just for having a similar premise and lose sight of the good things it has to offer.Don't be that type of person.

Decent story concept, bad execution. Nothing stands out. BAD.Doesn\'t really have spoilers but i recommend watching the show first, at least a few episodes///Art and sound design are both very good, like in most animes, nothing really outstanding or special, just good.The main concept of the anime isn\'t really bad, could be better. The execution is the problem. Story doesn\'t really goes nowhere, too much ""plot twists"" if you can call them by that name, and it doesn\'t focus even just a little bit on the outside world at all, like his friends and family just...don\'t care it seems because we almost can\'t see what\'s happening out there.Now, to the real problem. AWFUL, PATHETHIC characters. First of all; not even a single nice character, everyone including the mc is a pretty piece of shit, in a way or another.The mc apparently can\'t do things by himself, or is a secret masoquist because everything he does is to suffer. Goes back to play that shitty game, and suffers physically and psychologically. Talks to someone, his reaction when the other acts like a total asshole is to rage and then do nothing and acts like nothing happened. And apparently his big trauma is threated by everyone including him as a joke, so the story wants us to believe that he has a trauma that disabled him to do things for like 2 years or something but also threats it like a fucking joke... my god...Every npc apparently is a villain, no matter how good they act before. Just a society full of psychopaths.Now reona... shit, where do i start...Its probably the worst character of all. First of all, she\'s a scammer. Wouldn\'t be that bad, but i just can\'t tell if she\'s a human or not, and i myself am not emotional at all, but goddamn she\'s a soulless little b***. The mc has trouble with anything, emotionally or in a certain situation? Laugh, blame him, make him feel like shit, of course, that\'s what any normal person would do. Oh wait, i forgot to say she\'s a full grown adult? Yeah...Then she acts like kinda ""nice"" or something, like if the writer is trying to tell us that she\'s actually nice but just teases the mc. Bruh that\'s not how it works, go see Nagatoro or shows like that, that\'s how someone nice would act when trying to tease someone. If you are really hurting them, not just superficially, you notice and stop, try to comfort them or something... but nope, she just goes for the kill and then acts """"""""nice""""""""Not a single serious moment here, but it isn\'t a comedy either. The only emotion i can have watching this show is anger, and not in a good way maybe like in redo of healer that you feel anger and empathy for the mc and then enjoy the revenge. Nope, this show just makes me want to break things, because how stupid the story execution is, how hateful every character is.Everyone acts like if they were 10yo, laughing at someone when they have that kind of ""mistake"", and the one that made the mistake instead of ignoring it or telling them that they dont like to be threated like that, they just falsely rage.You feel nothing from the characters other than that, anger, and i just want them to die, the only good characters are the sister, that one friend of the mc, and the 40yo drunk guy (which isnt a nice person but it\'s like a good villain), which, suprise surprise, dont appear that much. Specially the sister and the friend.I\'m giving it a 3 because of the story concept, art and sound design. If the story concept was bad it would deserve a 2... no, a 1.I\'m sorry for every artist and musician that had to make this show, i hope at least you got paid enough, but probably not even that.First anime i make a review on, it was so bad i had to do it. I prefer every other anime i have on my list 10x more.My review got long very quick so probably no one\'s gonna read it, but if you did thanks, and this is just my opinion, even tho i don\'t know how anyone could give this show over a 6 maximum.EDIT: Finished last episode. The best episode probably, and its not because it ends or something like that, it\'s literally the best episode because it has some kind of development.Spoiler alert:In the start, Alicia sacrifices herself to save Hiro because some shit that Martin appeared in a dream and said that it wasn\'t hiro\'s fault etc etc. Would be good and believable if Alicia didn\'t act like a murdered towards hiro until that episode, even tho she said she entered the guard for him. But well, that isn\'t that bad, and this and the typical shonen moment after that aren\'t really bad.Then after a fight, another shonen moment, and the moment of Hiro losing, Hiro decides to reconstruct his life to defeat Tesla and eventually the game. That\'s good, and Hiro gained a lot in development, the problem is that this happens in the end, also Reona (still being the bitch she is) gets a little of development too, but it\'s still the worst character and Hiro shouldn\'t interact with her anymore, but whatever...If there is a second season i will watch it, and i hope that this development really means something and it\'s not just a moment and it will be the exact same as the first season.Also i\'ve seen other reviews saying that this is a comedy and things like that. If this is comedy this is probably the worst one, because it\'s not funny, and instead of thinking that a character or situation is funny, i think it\'s stupid/hateful/bad.So if this is a comedy, it\'s a really bad one, and if it isn\'t, it\'s still bad, another genre, but bad. don\'t care it seems because we almost can\'t see what\'s happening out there.Now, to the real problem.

For me it is one of the best examples of the saying ""never judge a book by its cover"".

Compare to other VRMMO game anime like SAO 5th episode is almost half of Aincrad-arc.To summarize it it pace is very slow. The story...it wouldn't be VRMMO RPG gaming anime in any sense it's more of comedy with MC backstory drama(up to this point). Which I hope it would be more faster and getting more glimpse on MC and story development, If anyone gonna ask would I still keep watching answer is YES. it wouldn't be VRMMO RPG gaming anime in any sense it's more of comedy with MC backstory drama(up to this point).

I would say that it almost reminds me off a parody of the VRMMO genre and that becomes it\'s biggest strength and makes the show a very enjoyable experience filled with humor and exciting moments.If I were to compare it to another show, I\'d say it\'s like KonoSuba.The art style is very good and the animation is crisp and realistic, however I think this is one of the things which holds the series back in my opinion. The realism and seriousness of the art style and animation contrasts goes hand-in-hand with it\'s supposed \'realism,\' but it does a bad job of accentuating the shows main selling point- the comedy.Besides this I have no other criticisms of the show. It\'s a very enjoyable watch, and I know that it\'s only going to keep getting better from here. I would recommend this show to those of you who are looking for something a bit more on the light side which you can watch for a quick laugh or two. many clichés, the characters are shallow and the plot is riddled with tropes, but rather than hold the show back, these things actually make it flourish through the comedic spin the show adds onto the events.The show KNOWS that it\'s clichéd and poorly written on the surface, and so it doesn\'t take its self seriously.

Also the lyrics of the opening really resonate with me. Overall I learned a lot of things seeing how Hiro changed his way of behaving and will learn more and more each time a watch this series, I really want to read the novel but I don´t know Japanese, maybe this will be the trigger to finally start learning that.

This anime has effort put into it. The story while using elements of the full dive mmo genre. does not feel like any other out there if you actually watched it. the effort the writer put in it was re-imaginig what was already put out there. even in the first episodes they show you what it could have been, but thats not the train we are on.this anime is a lilttle more complex that most but by no means a masterpiece. a little action and sense of danger. the author tries to constantly throw curve balls in the story some are dramatic some silly some are exciting that will keep you engaged in the narrative of the story it follows a story that is continuous and detailed. minute details and slow progression of the story might not be for everyone but in this anime every episode could be explained in two minutes but watching it gives you so much more detail and enjoyment. The overall experience of the anime is not the story progression but the growth of the character that being said only one character is really treated as human everyone else is just and npc that tells jokes on cue or shows up at the right time for dramatic effect overall 6/10 i would recommend to anyone who likes shows like Beelzebub, or Hataraku Maō-sama! edgy anime that make you want to watch just to see cool animations and graphics even if you already know who will win. you have comedic anime that lets you turn your brain off and enjoy outlandish comments and situations. there are also harem/romance that follow your typical story line and you are just walking down a road as old as time. now what i believe makes an anime great and worth watching is putting a bit of effort into it.

I'll explain why (note: I haven't read the source material, what follows is just my intuition speaking).It's plain to see that the story and character arc for the MC is a work in progress and so the cathartic payoff comes too little, too late. Still, that payoff should be the predominant theme in season 2 (if it happens and I very much hope it does). As it stands, season 1 feels like the first act of three: it sets the stage for...where the MC is at developmentally, and shows us the way for where he needs to be. Unfortunately, we haven't yet entered the meat of the story. And that's a problem because season 1 should have been good enough in its own right so that it would be successful enough to continue.From my perspective, the MC didn't really learn or change in a meaningful enough way until much too late. We were just left with a relatively unlikable passive subject who stuff happened to. He never really grasped the reins of his own life. HOWEVER:It seems clear to me that this is the point the author is trying to make with this character and world-building. The MC's approach to 'real-life' is half-assed and undirected, and therefore so is his approach to everything else, including 'games'. If you imagine that 'life is a game', it is a game that the MC has opted out of. The author contrasts this with a game world where the lines between 'real-life' and 'game' become blurred. The irony is that it's a game that is to provide him the means to learn important real-world lessons.It's obvious to me that the MC is on the verge of becoming far more likable and I think the pay-off for sticking with it will be so much more given that I personally dislike his passivity so much.I can see that the story and character development is building to a crescendo that just wasn't quite reached in the first season. That said, I can understand why some aren't satisfied with it as is, because as it stands, neither am I.

I did manage to finally finish it, to a pleasant surprise.The story is very weird and offputting. I'm not talking about the full dive aspect or the worthless MC or anything of the sort. What I mean is that the story initially set you up for certain expectations and then bends it in such odd ways. Because of this, you feel a bit off-put at times with the story, and it becomes hard to understand or catch up with (one...of the reasons why I dropped this anime initially).

Everyone, other than Hiro, isn't as fleshed out as you'd like them to. They just have a brief introduction and then go their ways until called in.

You\'d think the way the anime spelled it\'s premise out continuously from the very beginning there wouldn\'t be this much contention, but maybe I expect too much from the average viewer.Over and over again they drive home the point: \'this game is as real as real life,\'  In fact they at one point say: \'it\'s MORE real than real life.\'It\'s not like most Isekais in that respect, but here\'s the skinny: getting over trauma or real difficulties in your...life is not pretty and not easy. This anime is a tribute to that fact both literally and metaphorically in unison. Real life rarely goes how you expect it too and sometimes it throws you a total shit storm. I saw this anime as a showcase of how the MC deals with all the tribulations thrown at him, with pretty clear lines drawn between his in-game and out-of-game life. So if you\'re looking for a story of continued perseverance even when seemingly futal, or if you can relate to this, watch.I\'m not going to lie, it was pretty brutal to watch the MC go through so much and maybe I continued watching this because I relate to that or maybe it\'s my dark sense of humor, but the true beauty of this anime is that all the people who didn\'t finish watching it would be the same people not finishing the game in the show.

After reminiscing of all the bad things that's happened to MC throughout the episode he's had enough, he pushes Martin and somehow the knife got lodged into Martin's mouthWhy would the knife ever impale him from that motion?

All fantasy MMOs so far take place in middle ages.On top of everything else, the MC is just too stupid and cowardly, he could've just not played the game and made this dumpster fire of an anime end faster.

At least make the MC tackle him or something else besides what happened....who the hell thought this up?Continuing my rant, MC supposedly knows his way around MMOs, yet whines about stoning. All fantasy MMOs so far take place in middle ages.On top of everything else, the MC is just too stupid and cowardly, he could've just not played the game and made this dumpster fire of an anime end faster. I know a lot of people complained about SAO being bad for how the players get trapped and how their were flaws with the nerve gear but this anime makes SAO look like it has Oscar worthy writing."", 'tried this one on a whim, was very unsatisfied with the entire thing...each episode is extremely depressing and will leave you feeling frustrated on the main characters behalf, but you will be the one thinking ""i\'d just drop this as soon as i could log out and get my money back or destroy the game""those of us living in 2021 dont need any more heart break, frustration, stress, unfairness, etc in our lives, and thats all this anime is episode to episodewatching an anime character pee himself signed me off permanently and had me skipping through each episode to get the jist of...what happens,if youre hoping for a triumph story then dont watch this...basically a waste of time, the anime ""im standing on a thousand lives"" does this premise 100x better and has much more meaningful development behind it, but even that anime gets boring after season 2 though i recommend it over watching this piece of crap what happens,if youre hoping for a triumph story then dont watch this...basically a waste of time, the anime ""im standing on a thousand lives"" does this premise 100x better and has much more meaningful development behind it, but even that anime gets boring after season 2 though i recommend it over watching this piece of crap', 'After watching the anime I actually got interested in the continuation of the story, which is a good sign indicating that it was worth watching. But this anime still has some serious issues. It also reminded me of Grimgar so I will reference it a few times in the review.Story: 5. The premise is actually very good. The whole idea is interesting. You get to enjoy a sort of fantasy setting without annoying MMO garbage elements like HP bars and skill icons. At the same time, it is in parallel with a real-life story of the MC finding his way in life. There is Reona...and his relationship with her, though it isn\'t exactly romantic at this point. All of it can also be seen as a Grimgar-Esque dark fantasy-style deconstruction of the usual isekai trash.Full dive realistic game with proper AI can allow the MC to act in an essentially isekai setting without being dumb and irrational because of not going through existential crisis and survival stage. Most isekais suffer because they throw their MCs into action while not giving any normal reactions to a serious problem - like, you know, being separated from your family, education, job, the meaning of life, goals, comfort, safety. The MC is like ""hmm, I died/ have been thrown by mysterious forces into ANOTHER F-ING WORLD! Meh, Imma treat it like a game. Maybe gather a harem...""In this anime, however, the MC has all the rights to act as if he is in a game. Because he IS in a game.And the usual troupes are sort of mocked and punished. It\'s like using a game to show how stupid a game-like behaviour in an ACTUAL isekai world would be.Similar to how the first goblin fight in Grimgar shows how a REAL fight to the death is not fun or heroic, the Full-Dive does the same in a more comedic and laidback manner.That is the first good part.Another good part is tying together the game challenges with real-life trauma and problems. The MC is not exactly suffering or extremely poor or excessively bullied. But he has problems and is trying to escape into games. Yet it solves nothing. When he encounters the same real-life problems in the Full-Dive game he wants to stop playing, to just escape again. Thanks to Reona\'s invasive behaviour and his own stubbornness and lack of real-life consequences he keeps playing and eventually learns to deal with challenges, resulting in nice character growth.The problems with the story are mostly about the game itself:1) The so-called realistic game is inconsistent. MC is weak as in real life, has no skills, no magic or special privileges, treated like shit etc. - but then he is suddenly treated especially well by Tesla (an important big shot in the fantasy world) for no reason. Even at the end, the main villain kills all guards nearby like bugs, but takes extra special time with the MC, despite the fact that he is the weakest and least important person around at that point. The MC and the antagonist have a Mexican stand-off despite the fact that the villain could cut MC down in an instant like other guys. MC is even given a classic villain monologue and explanation of evil plans. Why? It runs counter to the previously established realism, even though it can be treated as a game mechanic.Then the sudden power-up with no logical explanation also completely clashed with the established game realism.And the ghostly magic sword with ZERO foreshadowings. A starting shit-tier sword suddenly turns into elite equipment just cause the hero killed his childhood friend (not by a sword BTW) and then made peace with his ghost? Bullshit!2) The walkthrough. The Bakugou, I mean, Kamui (the only player who cleared the game) has created a very annoying walkthrough, which is not necessary to the story and also detracts from the immersion and the value of the MC\'s experience. It would be better if there was no walkthrough at all.3) Pacing is all over the place and a lot of time is wasted, while the ending is rushed.The first half is nice but could be better. The latter half of the story is bad.Art: 7. It\'s good. Nothing to say really. Not stellar, but good.Sound: 7. Same. Good, but not special. Voice acting is good as well.Character: 7. Characters are actually not that good, but most don\'t matter. There are only two characters that make the whole series - MC and Reona. Both are good. MC has some depth. He does act somewhat stupid and repeatedly ignores warnings that the game IS REALISTIC and that he has to do things like IRL. He still tries to use healing herbs by pushing them as in other games, expects to smoke bombs to explode without igniting the cord, expects to be treated like the main hero etc.But he still fills his role nicely.Reona is the best character. Some are annoyed at her behaviour, like laughing when MC is experiencing trauma. He peed himself and she laughed seemingly not taking his feelings into account. But it is obvious to me that she actually did. Throughout the whole story, she behaved exactly in such a way that would cause MC to feel less sad and traumatized and instead more annoyed and embarrassed. She obviously cared about his feelings and wanted to distract him from trauma, encourage him. Her stupid reason for wanting him to win is obviously a lie, she has some depth and only acts stupid for comedic relief.But it could be done better, I admit.Other relevant characters include Kaede (imouto), school bullies and classmate friend - but they are less relevant and don\'t have much of a screen time to matter. AI characters are somewhat bland. The main villain is cliche and also sticks out because of his unexplainable special treatment towards the MC, which would be fine in a normal RPG-isekai or SAO clone, but not in a setting claiming to be realistic.To sum it up - characters are generally fine, there are too few of them that matter.Enjoyment: 6. I laughed a lot and liked the moments when various troupes were ridiculed, like MC expecting the childhood friend to stop trying to kill him (for killing her brother) after he grabbed her chest but instead being laughed at - ""I am adult you know! Do you think I never had my chest touched? Do you expect me to suddenly freeze just cause someone touched my breasts???""Such moments are the cheese of this anime. But the plot itself is mediocre at best. Reona is a nice pair of boobs and a cool romance option, but unfortunately, there is no romance with her so far. She is funny, but also annoying at times.The ending really detracted from my joy - rushed and somewhat full of plot holes.But I managed to watch till the end which is already rare for me, and I even felt the desire to read the novel, so it was apparently worth watching.Unfortunately, the story failed to portray the cruel realism and the fear of combat like it was done in Grimgar. Realism was shown in small details, but not where it mattered the most. Overall - the pacing was slow, and it felt like a prologue rather than a full season.

There are a few problems but it was enjoyable for me.Because of its storyline, this anime doesn't need awesome jokes, being serious is making it funny. And it sucks at trying to be funny with Reona's repetitive jokes.The other problem is Kamui the side character, has plausibility problems and doesn't change the story that much which makes him unnecessary. So without these 2 characters, this anime could be much better. For example, Alicia is a much more intriguing character than them. I wish she had more screen time instead of...these two.I really like the voice acting and the art is decent. The story starts well and it misses some opportunities but it doesn't go down that much. these two.I really like the voice acting and the art is decent.

And maybe, just maybe, you'll actually start to like watching the flame grow.--complaints--The real and virtual worlds are just terrible, for some reason. Everyone goes out of their way to be awful people. On top of that, no one in the real world seems to exist aside from five people, Hiro (the protagonist) included....Him commenting on how awful the worlds are doesn't make it any better, either.Since the protagonist immerses himself in VR games to get away from the awfulness of reality, it makes me wonder why he goes back to the awfulness of this VR game.Quite a few of the bad decisions he makes are because he thinks he's gonna get laid, particularly from Reona, the store clerk with huge breasts that got him into the game in the first place. Speaking of her, I don't know why Hiro doesn't get more angry than giving her a tsukkomi. She deserves a whack on the head with how much of a manipulator she is. Not once has she been an appealing character. There's only one appealing character in the show and she doesn't show up until the second half and even then it's only sparsely.Sometimes the show is funny, but most of the time the funny factor is being cancelled out by the fact that Hiro is the dead horse that doesn't get a break from being beaten in all senses of the word. After a certain point it's just not fun to see him getting kicked while he's down for the hundredth time.In this show, everything is awful and the protagonist has absolutely zero stake in it. He's just being taken along for the miserable ride. Similar to Tomozaki-kun, I don't see a reason for these protagonists to continue dealing with what they're dealing with considering their character types. It just feels like they should give up or fight back. Hiro does neither. A lot of the time, he actually has high hopes. Why?? What in his character story makes him so optimistic?? Did I miss that part??On top of that, the first half of the anime is basically a downward spiral of misery until episode six where things start picking back up and Hiro's not getting shit on for every single joke. Only half of them.--possible solutions--The base premise is really interesting and some episodes are actually fairly enjoyable. Other episodes are just misery visualized, though. A lot of ideas were done well and the series sticks to its name. This RPG is really, truly terrible, and it's unfair and unfun to second-hand experience, but that's what I signed up for. They also could've done literally anything to make the motivation of the protagonist actually substantial, because that's what dug at me the most. I think having a motivated protagonist would've made the series more bearable. Side characters that don't stick to their archetype would be nice too. Like, would it kill Reona to pay Hiro a compliment that isn't backhanded for *once*? There's only one or two serious-ish sections in the series that aren't totally played off for laughs by the end. Neither of them involved Reona, who's basically the deuteragonist.As for the side characters, they're one dimensional and stick with their character archetype 90% of the time. And I think that's a shame, because the potential in a redeemable and interesting Reona is there. I'd like to get at least a little bit of a teaser that would show me her motivations for doing what she does, aside from the ones she has for comedy's sake. Characters like her that make fun of the protagonist while being an ally are only likeable if they are extremely powerful or extremely helpful, and she is neither.Basically, if the characters made more sense I would like the series way more because the point of the premise is that the world is shit so I have no reason to be mad about that. Sure, it's a comedy so you can say that making deep characters isn't important. But Konosuba was also a comedy, and that was a series that had some of the strongest characters I've ever experienced.--ect.--The background art is nice but the animation isn't as nice. About 5-6 minutes into episode 6 there's a scene where Alicia twirls knives in an intimidating fashion. The problem is, the animation makes her just look like she lost half an arm and that her fingers were replaced by spinning_knife.gif. The facial expressions, at times, are equally as bad as that. But the settings/backgrounds are pretty good, especially during sunset or spiritual scenes.The voice acting is really nice and it's done by renowned VAs. Alicia in particular shines in this aspect, and Hiro can be particularly emotive. But this feels like a movie where they hire B-list actors to sell the movie and put no effort into the script or VFX. No disrespect to the people involved in the production, but there were some things that could've been done better and I'm certain they know that. Same with the author.The intro and outro are actually pretty good. I like the outro, it's got some real romcom vibes.--final--Look, as far as I know the LN got greenlit for an anime like four months after it started publishing and the actual anime came out four months after that. Clearly there wasn't a whole lot of thought put into whether or not they should, rather than if they could, turn it into an anime.

I can remember laughing out loud in the first episode at the distinctive style of modern Japanese...humour that relies on witty retorts paired with quick and calculated timing. We\'ve seen it in many anime and it doesn\'t take too much effort to pull off. I have to say that Daiki Yamashita does a good job of reaching here and there vocally, allowing him to deliver the comedically exaggerated lines pretty well. However, the gags tend to stick around this recurring idea of pissing pants and whatnot. The dynamic between Hiro and Reona for the most part is that of the teaser and the teased, which is exemplified by the lack of diversity in comedic gags on Reona\'s side (mainly pissing pants) and Hiro\'s victimised retorts which, although delivered decently, get repetitive and stale pretty quick.The issue arises when supposedly serious scenes are littered in between these gags. Although Hiro is supposed to be struggling against his trauma, it doesn\'t feel like it\'s something serious at all from how little flesh it was given in the exposition. The abrupt tonal changes don\'t translate the problems faced by our protagonist well at all and the shifts can often end up leaving a palpable disconnect between key scenes in the plot\'s progression, making you wonder what exactly you\'re supposed to feel. Hiro\'s realisation of his sin in avoiding Martin\'s death seemed to be the show\'s first step towards inciting some profound themes of cognizance in NPCs (already done) and responsibility. However, when suited up to the absurdism of his trials and tribulations, these themes feel misplaced. Take the entire mystery behind Ted for example. Although somewhat predictable from the exposition, where we have an independent nation where leaving is punishable, it could have been effective. But given the show\'s length and how diluted with comedic overtones it is, it didn\'t work.As for the actual characters, I have to say a few of them were likeable, namely Alicia and Ginji. However, the introduction of certain characters felt forced, as though to fit some checklist, although strangely enough it doesn\'t feel like any of the characters are archetypal which is a plus. Reona is likeable enough and I can see why many detest Hiro although he\'s pretty meh for me.The ED is pretty good and the OP is amazing. However it also feels thematically misplaced with the show. It gives off the strong nostalgic tempo and distortion of MYTH & ROID, who Mayu is sadly no longer part of. When this played during the last episode it was hard to not feel pumped. The art was very mediocre and nothing can be said about the animation.Overall, this isn\'t an anime that\'s worth dropping everything for and might be infuriating at times to watch.

The animation is unique looking but kind of poor at times. The music is actually pretty gas at times. Overall it is 7 with the show shining at certain moments but often times falling flat. I would give it a watch. It is not a typical isekai, so don't expect power fantasy but it kind of goes far in the other direction.  Like by guessing from the title of the...show, isekai world is indeed shitty so do not expect anything over powered from the MC. This is more of a comedy show with tiny amount of actual story and themes you can enjoy.I would actually go far enough to compare this show to demon king academy because it feels like it should fail at every aspect on being enjoyable but some how it just does it. show, isekai world is indeed shitty so do not expect anything over powered from the MC.

And I didnt enjoy a single minute...of it.All characters in this anime are godawful, and it is physically painfull to watch them except for one reasonable character i like but at the final episode for no reason he becomes an asshole and antagonist for no reason other than some terribly explained and forced reason he author decided to pull out of his ass.Last few episodes were fine but the majority of episodes were terrible . if you are a masochist who like all pain and reward at the end , then fine . watch this.If you are a normal viewer looking for a comedy anime , then chief it aint is! of it.All characters in this anime are godawful, and it is physically painfull to watch them except for one reasonable character i like but at the final episode for no reason he becomes an asshole and antagonist for no reason other than some terribly explained and forced reason he author decided to pull out of his ass.Last few episodes were fine but the majority of episodes were terrible . if you are a masochist who like all pain and reward at the end , then fine . watch this.If you are a normal viewer looking for a comedy anime , then chief it aint is!"", 'tl;dr Konosuba meets SAO in this meta/satire ""isekai"" with just enough spice to be worth the watch.For all its faults, Full Dive Kusoge is still underrated.Looking at the ratings that this show received I hesitated to watch it, but I\'m very glad that I did. Like me, you may struggle through some of the earlier episodes (though they have their merits), but the latter half is certainly worth watching.The primary appeal of Full Dive Kusoge is ""realism."" None of the overpowered MC or rapid success head start crap that you see elsewhere. MC doesn\'t automatically know how to sword duel or shoot fireballs. Additionally, the...game is Ironman Mode with no save scumming, so the mistakes that MC makes lives with him forever as cheap comedy.I\'ll start with things that I disliked about this show. Firstly, the second-most important character vexes me to no end. While she shines in a few moments in the season, Reona spends most of the show as a failure of comedy relief and a waste of screen time. Dialogue between her and Hiro is confusing and often detracts from what is happening in the show. While a certain part of that is me being annoyed on behalf of the MC, her character is one-dimensional, existing only to provide commentary for whatever Hiro is doing and laughing excessively when he makes a mistake (many of which are spurred by things Reona says). While the comedy is necessary for the show to work, I can\'t help but think that Reona\'s character could have been less obtrusive and abrasive to the viewer.I also have a bone to pick with how the show handles bullying and seeking help. Episode 9 was... hard to stomach. For a show that claims realism, its method of dealing with bullies is highly problematic and too idealistic. Trying to bully the bully only makes the wheel spin around, and bystanders are neither that passive nor that quick to change sides.On the other hand, the show does plenty right that IMO outweighs the negatives. Full Dive Kusoge provides a unique combination of drama and comedy isekai with the ultimately positive message of ""never give up."" The show pokes fun at common tropes in isekais from interactions with NPCs, healing and combat, to quests and plot points. And as far as the plot goes, it has a clear progression and goal in mind with no real filler episodes with quite a few plot twists both predictable and unpredictable.Hiro sees strong and believable personal growth from the beginning of the show where he\'s quite a self-pitying jerk to the end of the season where he is quite a bit more confident and mature. It\'s always more fun to watch an underdog rather than an OP MC, especially if they have at least half a brain. The MC is imperfect and willing to admit to it, faces emotional struggles both virtual and real, but is at heart a kind person.As a side note, fan service isn\'t too excessive though I still wouldn\'t watch this around your friends, and the closing theme absolutely SLAPS.I recommend this show but definitely don\'t feel bad about skipping parts that annoy you i.e. most of Reona\'s dialogue. 7/10, I\'ll definitely be looking forward to a second season. game is Ironman Mode with no save scumming, so the mistakes that MC makes lives with him forever as cheap comedy.I\'ll start with things that I disliked about this show.

One in which reviews include phrases like ""black humor."" Perhaps even one in which the characters in the show are endearing.But it is not this timeline.[spoilers]In general, it is a good idea to make your protagonist someone with whom the audience can empathize. It\'s reasonable to saddle them with emotional baggage that would make them vulnerable or perhaps a bit jaded. Well, in episode one of this nightmare our protagonist straight up murders his virtual best friend, for which the game awards him...an achievement, ""Best Friend Killer."" See, on paper, that sounds like it could be pretty funny. But the npc\'s of the game are, for all intents and purposes, indistinguishable from ordinary people. They appear to have feelings, memory, and they interact perfectly. So from an aesthetic point of view, your protagonist starts the show having committed an involuntary homicide and then fled from the scene. If the protagonist of an isekai is an insert for the audience, then what I feel after episode one is embarrassment, disgust, and guilt.And that\'s what I mean about an alternate timeline in which this show is great. An idea of an criticism is there, but the aesthetic is botched. It\'s like the show wants to revolt, upset, and mock its audience. It has a certain artwork to it sort of like a serial killer who decorates his cellar with a mobile of the skulls and femurs of his victims. The show is about a video game that does everything it can to make its players feel miserable, depressed, and hopeless out of some tortured philosophical belief that learning to endure immense and pointless suffering can polish a young man\'s soul. And guess what, the show is exactly the same thing for its audience.In the end I gave this show a score of ""dreadful,"" because I mean it literally. It elicits a strong feeling of dread. But you know what, there is something beautiful in there. Like a diamond in a pile of rusty shaving razors. an achievement, ""Best Friend Killer.""

However, the in-game NPCs do hold value in character - yet this is still relatively similar to other anime. Sound design is decent but a lot of the sounds are reused and repeated.Overall, my enjoyment was decent, it's deffinitely more refreshing than stuff like SAO. However, the anime needs to decide on the specific theme it wants to follow.

I was expecting another Isekai that's both funny and serious at the same time. To my chagrin, Full Dive was neither funny nor serious. At the end of the show, I was left dumbfounded as to how I managed to finish the entire season only to actually see some character growth at the final 10 minutes of the last season.Talk about funny. I'm not the greatest fan of KonoSuba (I gave it a 7/10), but even I know funny when I see...one. The jokes on Full Dive are stale, dry, and unnecessarily forced on the wrong situations.

Pokemon Movie 15: Kyurem vs. Seikenshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12671/Pokemon_Movie_15__Kyurem_vs_Seikenshi,"[""Hey! This is my first time reviewing a Pokemon movie! This just premiered and I liked it so much, I thought maybe I'd take some time out of my busy schedule to review it since I haven't done any reviewing in a while. Surprisingly this happens to be one of the better Pokemon movies! Heck, I'd even argue that this one may be one of the best in a very long while! Besides, I'm kinda bored out of my mind so I thought I'd review this to pass some time a little. The story in itself is nothing new. A Pokemon named Keldeo (the blue,...white, and red unicorn, who is oh so adorable!!) tries to become one of the Swords of Justice (pretty lame title, I know), a trio of Pokemon consisting of Virizion, Terrakion, and Cobalion. But to become one, he has to fight Kyurem, the ice-type dragon. But things go bad during battle, and Keldeo winds up running into Ash and the gang. They have to save the trio of Pokemon and in the process, Keldeo learns things about himself.Yeah yeah, we've all heard this story before. It's old as dirt, and this movie is no different. However, I must sing lots of praises for this movie, as it's very VERY different from the other Pokemon movies. The best thing? Keldeo himself is the main character, and only he gets the spotlight! Ash doesn't hog the glory or become some sort of chosen one or dumb stuff like that! Nope nope nope! Not in this movie! Ash and his friends are just supporting characters, and the movie is basically Keldeo's character arc. None of the movies before this one pulled such a daring move, and I love it! What a breath of fresh air, as usually the main character in the show/movie always has to hog the spotlight according to the creator's wishes, which really sucks, as there's no need to focus more on the characters in the show when there's plenty of time for that in the actual show. But here? This movie's all about Keldeo, and he receives a lot of character development (and very convincing development at that) here, and believe me when I say here, he's a VERY well-developed Pokemon. Probably the most well developed in a very long while. What also makes this movie drastically different from the rest of the movies is that FOR ONCE it is NOT ABOUT SAVING THE WORLD!! There's no villain out to destroy the world, there's no prophecy, or anything like that! Kyurem may look and act like a villain, but he isn't really a villain. He's just a Pokemon just like the rest of them, and he actually has some sense! There's no pointless saving the world plot. The movie is simply about growing up, confronting fear, making mistakes and fixing them, and overcoming obstacles. It's as simple as that...and simple is exactly what this movie needed! Finally, everyone here has a purpose to serve, and they serve their purpose well!While it definitely is great, it does have it's flaws. For me, the most jarring flaw is in its animation. For some reason, the humans' faces looked really distorted, particularly Iris when scenes focused on her. She looked like someone tried to draw a face with a paralyzed hand at various points. The CG can clearly be seen in this movie, and it's rather intrusive. Plus, one nameless character who only appears in the beginning has REALLY WEIRD hair, and it just freaked me out to no end. But that character didn't appear again, as she isn't important to the story. Yes! This is also the first Pokemon movie in which there's no movie-only human supporting character! What a huge breath of fresh air, as I was getting tired of those! But while this movie does subvert a heck of a lot of traditional Pokemon movie cliches, as its own standalone film, it's still a big cliche storm in itself, and the story it tells isn't something original. But considering that this is a huge subversion of Pokemon movie cliches, I can forgive it. Also, Swords of Justice? Really? What kind of cliche and redundant name is that?! Plus the trio themselves aren't really swords, and I don't think they should be called swords from the way they use their attacks! They're more like glowing horns!I've recently been watching Suede, Linkara, and JewWario review the Pokemon movies on That Guy With The Glasses, and a lot of things they point out are things I never noticed before when I was a child watching them. Well, it's been a long time since I actually saw the movies, and I do have few memories of the earlier movies, so I guess that could be it. But man, they're totally right! The morals in the early movies are so ambiguous and hopelessly confused! But that's because of 4Kids Entertainment's adaptations of them, trying to make them more accessible to kids. The morals in this more are simple, subtle and aren't shoved down your throat, even though they're still there lingering in the background, the dialogue, and animation, and it didn't need some pointless and extraneous save the world from a great evil villain plot to convey these messages. Heck, this is the kind of movie we should be showing to our kids to teach them what's really important, not the earlier Pokemon movies and their ham-handed morals and messages!All in all, while it isn't anything new, it breaks away from the stereotypes associated with Pokemon movies and tells its own simple story without trying too hard, and it stands on its own hooves with gusto, and I love it for that! Also, Vic Mignogna voices Keldeo. Can you believe it?! But I think it makes him all the more adorable! He's voicing a cute little unicorn pony who shoots water from its hooves and break dances while attacking! How can you not love that?!

There\'s virtually nothing I can praise this film for.The art quality seems to have slightly decayed since the last film. I\'m not sure whether to pin this on use of unremarkable locations and directing or if it\'s really true. Either way, this not-even-feature-length cartoon, boasts multiple locations we\'ve seen before - albeit, slightly edited this time around. Train sequence in the mountains is a carbon copy of the one in Shaymin\'s adventure. The city has no features to distinguish it from a...dozen of other cities in the Pokemon universe. The only unique location present is Kyurem\'s arena - and it\'s not an interesting one to see. While there is some neat coreography in the final battle accompanied by some nice animation, you won\'t lose yourself in it for longer than a minute. Unbelievable character development and feats clearly summoned by needs of the plot will make you groan. With this faint praise out of the way and music not worthy a mention, lets move to the real problems - characters, dialogue and plot.""This place is not meant for humans"" - Kyurem, warning Ash & company to leave a human built, post industrial era, metal structure.The biggest problem with the film is Keldeo himself. This pony is insufferable. His personality can be summed up as egoistical, rash and cowardly. The film never attempts to make us care about him, as it asumes we already do. In the same way, film asumes we\'ll believe in character development which never actually occured. A confession of an obvious lie with no symbolic significance isn\'t a groundbreaking character moment. In the same way, Ash did a half-assed job at helping him, being little more than an audience stand in. He shouldn\'t\'ve been in the film in the first place. The supporting ponies of justice aren\'t much better. Each one of them acts like a stereotype and has nothing to do except spout exposition. Kyurem himself is not connected to Reshiram and Zekrom in any tangible way and the arbitary idea of making him a traditional enemy of the brony squad seems poorly taught out.Plotwise, the film boasts a few impressive achievements. This marks the first pokemon sequel in which our heroes trespass, blatantly destroy city property, and then steal airships and trains with no reprecussions whatsoever. It also boasts the surprising achievement of happening at night so that we see no more than three people in the whole city. Beyond that, one of my favorite continuity errors is a malfunction on air ship\'s engines which lead to its fall... that never occurs because five minutes later Iris is flying as if nothing happened. No explanation given, of course. This should paint the picture much more vividly than a boring plot synopsis ever could.I could ramble on and on, but I don\'t feel like it.

Avoid this film.', 'While I haven\'t been paying too much attention to the current Pokemon season, when I read that Cartoon Network would be showing the latest Pokemon movie, I figured I\'d give it a shot and see how it is.  After seeing it, I would say that, while it\'s not necessarily a bad movie, it really wasn\'t that great either.  I have seen all of the First Movie, Movie 2000, and Pokemon Heroes, and I think bits and pieces of some others, and I can definitely say that this was the least impressive to me compared to those 3.  I think some of that...has to do with the story, which had little suspense.  The main characters that many are familiar with are basically supporting characters in this movie as opposed to being heroes or the like.  Speaking of the characters, like with the TV series itself, I\'m also not enthusiastic about the new characters.  They just don\'t have the charm that the others had, those of course being Brock, Misty, May, and Dawn.I can only recommend this movie to fans of the Pokemon franchise.  Everyone else can skip it, though I doubt they need my opinion for that.  Even for Pokemon fans or casual observers, I can\'t give this a full recommendation.  Like with most if not all Pokemon movies, this is just an opportunity for the franchise to introduce the legendary Pokemon not seen in the TV series.  Unlike the other movies though, the lack of any ""world in peril"" or other intriguing plot keeps it from standing out or being that memorable.  For all this, I give it a 5/10 (Mediocre). has to do with the story, which had little suspense.

The character designs are nice despite being a bit mundane but the background animation is absolutely lovely. The background animation has a lot of detail and is aesthetically beautiful. The lighting is also on point and it further amplifies the already good animation....The story is also pretty solid and I found it to be pretty well written despite some skewed Pokemon logic and shounen cliches. I really like the almost medieval and fantasy atmosphere and that's what really gave this movie a spark. The characters are average at best, they are likeable but they range from cliche, to bland, to just plain idiotic.The music is pretty good though not on the level of other anime OSTs. The dub is also well done though I found that some of the dialogue were very generic for shounen standards and had some holes.In conclusion Kyurem vs The Sword of Justice is an enjoyable and decently written Pokemon movie with good music amazing visuals and a fun story and despite having notable flaws I found it to be a good but not great film.

The story itself wan't surprising, with Ash encouraging Keldeo to face its fears and the eventual conclusion which really shouldn't surprise anyone in this concept.Team Rocket didn't get featured (other than in a blink-and-miss shots irrelevant to the movie...itself), which helped the story to stay balanced and focused on its real goal.Kuyrem was an interesting, dark Pokemon to meet.

The wacky humor is more in line with the wacky humor we see in other shows of the crackfic genre which are successful...in that while the audiences willing suspense of disbelief is pushed in an unexpected manner, they still end up being believable.All three girls instead of the main protagonist A-Ko end up getting fleshed out, as do a few side characters such as the teacher and Mari.

The spaceship that crash-landed precariously atop a tower (that was actually another crashed spaceship) in the movie has been turned into a massive entertainment complex in the span of just three weeks. The aliens are trying to raise money to repair the spaceship so they can return to their home planet (preferably with C-Ko),...while B-Ko’s father, who’s just as loony if not loonier than B-Ko herself, wants to confiscate the spaceship to acquire its technological secrets. Meanwhile, A-Ko just wants to enjoy summer vacation with C-Ko, while B-Ko continuously tries to get in their way.Despite the outlandishness of the premise, the plot is slightly more cohesive than the one in the movie. Plus, since we already have established the characters and setting, the story in this OVA is a bit easier to follow.The characters haven’t changed at all from the way they were in the movie, and they don’t really receive any development, either, unless you count the “reformed” aliens (whose mass killings in the movie have been conveniently forgotten about). We get introduced to a new character, Hikaru Daitokuji, who is B-Ko’s father and head of a major financial conglomerate. His goofy antics rival those of B-Ko, and it’s easy to see that they’re related.The animation and direction are comparable to those of the movie, although perhaps less “cinematic” in scope and scale. There are similar animation gags and Easter eggs that appear for a few seconds (or even just a split second) on screen, and some of the scene compositions are similar — the ending scene is even framed in an almost identical way to the movie’s ending.All of the characters who appeared in the movie are voiced by the same actors here, so most of them sound good, but I still find C-Ko’s voice to be grating. The music is decent, but the ending theme is not as catchy as the one in the movie.Compared to the movie, “Project A-Ko 2” does not have as much objectionable content. While there are scenes of the girls changing clothes and wearing swimsuits, there’s no nudity this time. The upskirt shots are still there, but have been toned down a bit. The violence is mostly cartoonish in nature, with robots shooting lasers and missiles, etc. Also, while there are some flashing lights, they don’t go on as long as they do in the movie, so it’s much easier on the eyes.Overall, I would definitely recommend watching “Project A-Ko 2” if you’ve seen its theatrical prequel, as it’s nearly just as good and continues the movie’s story. while B-Ko’s father, who’s just as loony if not loonier than B-Ko herself, wants to confiscate the spaceship to acquire its technological secrets. Meanwhile, A-Ko just wants to enjoy summer vacation with C-Ko, while B-Ko continuously tries to get in their way.Despite the outlandishness of the premise, the plot is slightly more cohesive than the one in the movie. Plus, since we already have established the characters and setting, the story in this OVA is a bit easier to follow.The characters haven’t changed at all from the way they were in the movie, and they don’t really receive any development, either, unless you count the “reformed” aliens (whose mass killings in the movie have been conveniently forgotten about). We get introduced to a new character, Hikaru Daitokuji, who is B-Ko’s father and head of a major financial conglomerate. His goofy antics rival those of B-Ko, and it’s easy to see that they’re related.The animation and direction are comparable to those of the movie, although perhaps less “cinematic” in scope and scale.

Shen Ji Long Wei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52101/Shen_Ji_Long_Wei,"[""Shen Ji Long Wei follows Shen Lang, an agent from a futuristic world who is transported into the ancient world of martial arts. After arriving, Shen Lang makes it his purpose to reconcile with his lost comrades but is swept up in the affairs of the martial world, forcing him to live by the art of cultivation. With his modern firearms, handheld military equipment, and various modern tools, Shen Lang has the best of both worlds. How will his journey play out?Story & Character: 4/10The idea of a transported soldier is not a new isekai concept, especially in Chinese literature, but Shen Ji Long Wei...tries to make the story as playful and casual as possible. However, I found a few downsides with this series.First, the pacing is too fast, making many of the major arcs feel incomplete or rushed because Shen Lang moves on before concluding them. Second, the plot focus shifts arbitrarily from saving his comrades to participating in sect events or opening special dimensions, which delays the actual narrative further. Third, there is no real challenge or antagonist. Because Shen Lang is calculative, he chooses to retreat and cultivate before challenging a strong enemy. While this is a great character trait, he gets distracted by side events after he is freed from time-skip cultivation, eventually losing the plot.Shen Lang starts off with all his memories intact, as well as his military equipment, so we see tactful use of his equipment. Instead of proper development with his skills in montages or chance encounters with skill books, we get 3, 5, and 8-year time skips while he is in seclusion. It's not a bad idea to skip unnecessary training, but the side characters during this time frame feel even more alienated because they aren't in contact with Shen Lang for so long. This happens several times in the series, where Shen Lang tries to play cat and mouse with his companions after abandoning them for years. The characters Shen Lang meets in chance encounters feel stereotypical as extras because they disappear from the story after the event or episode ends, many of them having little background or even a name to their face (as seen in the stable sealed dimension and Penglai Mountain opening arcs).Art & Sound: 3/10 & 6/10At this point, Youku Animation is known for their distinct character designs and cinematography. They feel rough and amateurish, with many action scenes lacking proper impact, relying instead on fast-paced X-axis transitions. The characters are all keyframed, so movement feels mechanistic, which is expected from a small-budget production. Environments lack post-processing features like ambient occlusion or anti-aliasing, and many city scenes have low population density.Voice acting felt amateurish at times, with character grunts and screams feeling fake. The sound effects weren't necessarily bad, but they weren't amazing by modern standards. The music choice was fairly suitable, and the fight scenes felt more immersive with the suspenseful rock music.Overall & Enjoyment: 5/10This is one of those series where you overlook its pitfalls in favor of its light-hearted gag humor and absurd action. There aren't many anime that will brazenly have a main character bring rocket launchers, firearms, or even a flying car into primitive worlds. The action, although very one-sided and lacking in logic, is a good opportunity to let your imagination run wild. Although the characters are very lacking in depth, they occasionally shift the focus away from Shen Lang.

Still I felt like I should have skipped few episodes and save my time.The plot is really unbearable, MC teleported in a cultivation world and started using unlimited guns, grenades, RPG. I mean how the hell someone like him got the inheritance. There is no character growth for MC, he stays a jerk throughout the whole season. Also the most unusual part is every cultivator can fly even MC himself can but instead of flying he uses a flying car to...go around.I strongly believe this is an utter rubbish with no uniqueness. The graphics and art style are really good but the story and dialogues just killed it.

Juusen Battle Monsuno,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13185/Juusen_Battle_Monsuno,"[""Hello this is Avato-chan and I will be reviewing Monsuno / Juusen Battle Monsuno!(A/n)This is based both on the english and japanese release.Ok lets start off with an overview , like a typical battle story, This is aimed at young children and more specificaly boys.Although I am not in the target audience myself I quite enjoyed this series sofar.Story(6) In a nutshell Chase is looking for his father,a scientist who disapeared and uses monsuno ,which his fater created to go on a journy to find him.Villans come along who are looking for his father as well and try to stop Chase and his gang and...battle him with monsuno.Although the story's idea may seem over used and or cliche ; I like it because it brings some unique situations ,humour and elements into the story.Art(7)The art is good ,but not the best I have seen ,the same goes for the animation.The backgrounds like the jungle scenes are realy good.The overall animations can use some work.Sound English (6) The voice actor's are good in their buisness ,however in this particular show their quality has gone down alot ,the voices do not fit the charactor ,the sound a bit too old and plain. It takes quite awhiile to get used to their voices ,but now I find it likeable. The thing that made me rate this a 6 though is the music used in the show, its not realy noticible and i like music that gets me hyped up.The theme music preformed by Far East Movement was just amazing! It was the only reason I watched the first 10 or so episodes ...no jokeSound Japanese (7) Wow the voices are actualy their age!!!! It is a dramatic change from the english voice cast. It fits well thats all i have to say.The backgroung music was noticeable! Oh my gosh it was amazing and the theme song ,the opening was good as well it shows team core  tech's adventures very well and gives a glimpse of the good times ,I like it.The ending theme song Spin Go was very good too , it made me want to launch my core!Character (5) The charactors are not that unique. But they have good qualities to them. The most unique and diffrent character would be Dax Bayal. ,although they also are stero typical like the rest of the cast In the first 18 episodes i've seen sofar there has not been any thing stuning about the characters that has occouredEnjoyment (6) This show is relaxing and mindless to watch ,it has an easy to folow plot and simple characters that don't acquire much thought.It keeps me watching because I want to see further relationship developments between the group and more epic battlesOverall score 6.5 which I round up to a 7 . Its a good show belive me! Thats why I wrote this ,I hope you enjoy chase's adventures as well ~!If you have any further questions regarding Monsuno please feel free to ask me. battle him with monsuno.Although the story's idea may seem over used and or cliche ; I like it because it brings some unique situations ,humour and elements into the story.Art(7)The art is good ,but not the best I have seen ,the same goes for the animation.The backgrounds like the jungle scenes are realy good.The overall animations can use some work.Sound English (6) The voice actor's are good in their buisness ,however in this particular show their quality has gone down alot ,the voices do not fit the charactor ,the sound a bit too old and plain.

They do horrible things.The leads are awesome, all well written and very straightforward....They are all brave and clever, and well rounded.They are relatable.Bren is especially relatable. He's not the bravest or strongest or smartest, but he does his best.Jinja is one of the best females ever! She is one of my most favourite characters ever. She is a total badass and awesome. She wins some fights by her martial prowess, not monsuno.She a straightforward, strong, character.Chase is a awesome leader, and he is badass and brave.

They are made from diferent animals, elements, etc.A unique thing is, they all look like the faction that made them. They have the faction colours.

And it can go dark.What happens to Jon Ace at one point is surprising and sad.The monsuno themselves have a unusual and sad secret. There's a very surprising and sad twist as to the monsuno essence.The art style, designs, and animation,  is excellant and looks good.They all have realistic shapes. Like wide and realistic looking hips, and tall and broad figures.The characters all look and sound like the age they are. The leads look like older teenagers. They look like they could travel and do the things they do.If a childs a child, it looks and sounds like a child. If it's a teenager, it looks and sounds like a teenager. If a persons a adult, they look and sound like adult.The english voice actors are all awesome. There are regional accents and diferent races.The clothes are good and always age appropriate.They wear practical clothes, with flat or low heels. If they have high heels, they can walk on them.The children dress like children, which is very good.And team coretech, and other teenagers, wear clothes befitting a older teenager, that cover up everything that should be covered up or cover them completely.Most of the characters are very covered up.

But sometimes they change them, and wear diferent things.The world is futuristic and well done.With lots of diferent places.One faction, S.T.O.R.M, is in control, and they have awesome vehicles and massive militery bases about.It has some awesome vehicles. Ranging from high tech trains, S.T.O.R.Ms many militery vehicles, to huge ships.Jeredys train is especially awesome.The theme tunes are absolutely awesome.

Loveless Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3057/Loveless_Specials,"['In case you\'re wondering, this is irrelevant to the story whatsoever. Basically, they were just trying to hype it up to some second season or continuation, which unfortunately never came. They talk about some episodes and some important points of the story so far, in a more humorous kind of way. I am supposing you have already watched the main anime to search for the specials, but if you didn\'t, this little sum-up may actually sort of help with eventual doubts if you didn\'t go through the trouble of reading the manga beforehand.I myself have quite the problem with the anime itself, because it took...too much time with ""character development"" and none with the actual plot, pushing it until the very last minute to simply throw that in your faces in a not-so-smooth kind of way. The anime story follows up to the 4th volume of the manga, and the specials don\'t add anything, and just tease what could happen in the future (which is only reachable by the manga). The main characters even try to play a little bit with the ending the main anime took, but since not even the producers were certain about what could happen, there was really nothing they could do.For the ones who enjoy some chill in quick episodes with Ritsuka and Soubi with a different mood and more set out to the fun, I can recommend...? Well, better watch one and see what you think. They are very short, about one minute and a half each, so by the end of all of them it will be like watching half a minute of every episode... too much time with ""character development"" and none with the actual plot, pushing it until the very last minute to simply throw that in your faces in a not-so-smooth kind of way.

It was fun to watch and I think that\'s all that matters, since this is basically just to hype up a second season that never came. It also explains, in a humorous way, some scenes from the anime, so I think that\'s also an advantage (although not a lot of scenes and not all of them are \'explained\', sometimes they just make funny commentaries about them).Overall, I\'d say it\'s worth watching since it takes at most 10 minutes of...your time and it\'s also enjoyable. your time and it\'s also enjoyable.']"
Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam - Adjournment,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12429/Last_Exile__Ginyoku_no_Fam_-_Adjournment,"['So just to let people know, as this is a recap, this review shall be short but not sweet. OPINIONS FOLLOW!What we have here is an interesting way to recap one whole season and almost half of another. Whereas usually recaps follow right after a shows season ends, like it states on the show page; the first is but a recap of the initial 9 episodes of the 2nd season, and the 2nd recap retells the events of the first season that aired almost 10 years prior. Albeit considering the gap of time between seasons, it is still odd how the recaps are ordered.So as...for my summary:I am a type of guy whom enjoys recaps simply because they will summarize a show to the point that I will or will not watch based on my feelings afterwards, as IM sure Most ANYONE WOULD lol. The feeling I got from these recaps was of a somewhat interesting show that, like the countries that just hover around and aimlessly shoot at each other in it, leads nowhere. Hence this review to try and steer people away. HOWEVER I urge those of you whom still doubt or have a genuine interest in the genre of skyship or steam punk to engage in the viewing of these recaps and make the judgment for yourselves.I for one give this an overall 6 as it would not waste my time as much as the whole series, which would therefore be a 5/10 lol.In conlusion:Watch the 2nd recap  if you have not seen the 1st show or at least not seen season 1 in a long time, then watch the episode about the most recent season. You will either like it and choose to watch the whole/one part of the series because its a steam punk mix of Fractale+Eureka Seven, or you wont. Over and out. for my summary:I am a type of guy whom enjoys recaps simply because they will summarize a show to the point that I will or will not watch based on my feelings afterwards, as IM sure Most ANYONE WOULD lol. The feeling I got from these recaps was of a somewhat interesting show that, like the countries that just hover around and aimlessly shoot at each other in it, leads nowhere.
