Black Clover: Jump Festa 2018 Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38768/Black_Clover__Jump_Festa_2018_Special,"[""I usually never watch specials since they are mostly fillers, but depends. This one is kinda weird, captains and guests get asked questions about certain parts of the anime. It was kind of a reminder of the previous parts that took place before.Nothing special, but the ending was really nice. Loved the characters breaking the 4th wall as if the creators / studio was talking to the viewers.Other than that, there's nothing of much interest other than silly questions and moments. Unless you want to attend the quiz yourself or something.TL;DR Watch it while eating, makes a good time killer and stomach killer "", ""As low as I've rated the first jump festa, I couldn't imagine it there could be a record-breaking bedrock. This was almost an insult.I get they were trying to pull something off on the fans as a sort of thank you for your support, but they could have gone a different way and still make it better.The humor in this was just one forced shitfest that tried a lot harder and ended up very cringy and with no results. There were key moments and jokes that get to you, but only as far as making you almost crack a smile, nothing more.The stupid looking hats...were there and got me triggered on how color vibrant they are, which doesn't fit in the cold atmosphere of Black Clover, they stood out way too much it was annoyingly distracting, and let's not forgot how weirdly American they look, totally ruined a lot of the episode. were there and got me triggered on how color vibrant they are, which doesn't fit in the cold atmosphere of Black Clover, they stood out way too much it was annoyingly distracting, and let's not forgot how weirdly American they look, totally ruined a lot of the episode."", ""A funny filler episode. It's okay in its deliverance. However, it needed more quiz, and, being an anime, I thought Japan don't celebrate Thanksgiving, like us British people, but apparently they do, according to this entry. It is quite strange.The premise is that there's a quiz, but it's kinda not a quiz, because of the amount of Black Bulls stuff there are, and almost not the rest of the Magic Knights stuff. It's quite annoying to be honest. Like, there's almost no point in this funny episode, except from remembering the characters name and stuff they did, and the things they use, and the...names they give the things.If you're binge watching it, like I am, then there's little to no point to this episode, except if you don't remember the names.That being said, it's funny. I liked the pointlessness of the episode. A little break from the actual series. However, I wanted to fast forward the flashbacks from previous episodes, because I've watched them. names they give the things.If you're binge watching it, like I am, then there's little to no point to this episode, except if you don't remember the names.That being said, it's funny.

It was fun and very entertaining to watch!The jokes were corny, but I think that makes it funnier. I do wish we got to see a few more characters in this OVA, but I can still consider it a masterpiece. It was funny and I would like to see more like this. It was fun to see the voice actors dubbing their hearts out. I watched in english dub, but I skimmed the episode subbed as well.Anyway, the squad captains, Asta, and Yuno are on a type of game show and they have to answer some goofy questions...asked by other characters. Asta and Yuno are determined to win the prize so that they can send it back to their home village, Hage.It's a funny OVA that gave me a good laugh. I most definitely recommended if you like comedy! asked by other characters.

Bakuon!! OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31883/Bakuon_OVA,"[""So I finally got around to watching this, and I really didn't want that other review to be the only one...This OVA basically just feels similar to some of the better episodes from the main series. By that I mean it has a nice balance of comedy, fan-service, and sweet moments. And the animation seems to be a bit better than the main series. The story isn't Shakespeare, but if you watched the main series I imagine you already know what to expect. So if you watched the show, then this OVA is a no-brainer. After I watched it, I felt stupid for putting off...watching it for so long...Edit: So apparently they made another OVA! I finally got a chance to watch it recently, so I thought I should update this review.I didn't like the second OVA quite as much as the first, probably because it revolves around Hijiri, who wasn't exactly my favorite character in the show. It still delivers the comedy and sweet moments, but unfortunately no fan-service this time. watching it for so long...Edit: So apparently they made another OVA!

I really don't know how some of the reviewers manage to write really detailed reviews so like I said it's just a honest review. To begin with, the story wasn't that special at all. There were funny moments and everything, but the story didn't had any fire or any hooks (I mean it wasn't that entertaining to watch (checked my facebook several times while watching it)).On my opinion if you just stick to the main series and don't watch the OVA, you won't miss anything special and maybe save up some time.Is it worth to...watch ? Not really, but if you like Bakuon!! Then yes.Story: 6Enjoyment: 6Overall: 6*Spoiler*Raimu Senpai saves the day like always. watch ? Not really, but if you like Bakuon!!

It\'s the Bakuon OVA, an anime that\'s like a motorcycle ride through a rainstorm of mediocrity.Let\'s start with the story, or lack thereof. It\'s like a bunch of high school girls who love motorcycles, but not much else happens. It\'s like watching paint dry, if the paint was trying to be edgy and cool.The voice over work is decent enough, but the music is forgettable at best. It\'s like elevator music for people who don\'t like elevators.Now, I know what you\'re thinking. \'But , what about the motorcycles? Surely the motorcycles are...cool?\' Well, they\'re not. They\'re like riding a scooter through a parking lot. Sure, it\'s fun for a little bit, but then you realize you\'re just going in circles.Overall, I\'d give This OVA a score of 6.333/10. It\'s not terrible, but it\'s not exactly setting the world on fire either. If you\'re really into motorcycles, you might find something to enjoy here, but for the rest of us, it\'s a forgettable ride.--------------------------------------Baiklah, apa yang kita miliki di sini?

Ini seperti kisah tentang sekelompok gadis SMA yang suka motor, tapi tidak banyak yang terjadi. Ini seperti menonton cat kering, jika cat itu mencoba menjadi keren.Pekerjaan suara cukup baik, tapi musiknya mudah dilupakan. Ini seperti musik latar lift untuk orang yang tidak suka lift.Sekarang, saya tahu apa yang Anda pikirkan. ""Tapi , bagaimana dengan sepeda motor? Pasti sepeda motor itu keren?"" Yah, mereka tidak. Seperti mengendarai skuter di parkiran. Tentu, itu menyenangkan untuk sedikit waktu, tetapi kemudian Anda menyadari bahwa Anda hanya berputar-putar.Secara keseluruhan, saya akan memberikan skor 6,333/10 untuk OVA ini.

Ramiu is another main character and i mean personally i can't describe here than she just doesn't talk at all like that the only real thing about her. Hijiri is another main character and she is a person who is actually wealthy and has her own butler drive her around and such sense she can't but she does have a pretty good attitude and not a snobby one again just a cheerful and nice character. Onsa is another main character and she actually has a bike shop unlike the others (granted her father runs it but hopefully you get my point) so she like everyone her is actually a cheerful and kind person in the anime. Rin is the last main character here and she is really passionate about Suzuki bikes to the point of arguing over it with Onsa (they get into alot cause she loves them but Onsa personally hates them so there you go) she can kinda have a snobby attitude but she is a nice and good character here (also i usually don't add support characters here but will but just one). Chisame is a supporting character and she goes to the bike club later she was a minibike rider but doesn't ride them on the rode cause she think they shouldn't be on the rode (uh ok that makes no sense but roll with it) but she is a good character i personally didn't care for her cause i don't know she just seems gloomy and stuff ALL the time but she again is a decent character i should say. (copied it from my own review sense they act the same here).Enjoyment: What i liked: both OVA's did there job pretty good the comedy i wouldn't say is there at both but i did make me smile a good couple of times also the enjoyment of it is there also again all the same VA's who did a good job with the anime and the OVA's as well here. What i didn't like: i think the only thing i could say i didn't like was that Hijiri getting in a sense her own episode (granted the other girls are there but i feels like just her episode) i didn't mind her but some people who didn't like her should probably say no to this OVA but it was pretty good i never minded Hijiri.Overall: id give both a 6 the OVA's overall were pretty enjoyable comedy isn't really there but it kinda is the Va's again being here and they did the job pretty good here as for the OVA's in general they were pretty good you really wouldn't be missing anything by skipping the OVA's but i'd give them a shot if your a fan of the anime. good and also the characters and the bikes as well wasn't bad at all.Sound: There was no Op for both of the OVA's but there was for the Ed (kinda odd) but the Ed were good also all the Va's come back so they all did pretty good here.Character: Hane is the main character of this anime and she is well a really bright light and just overall fun and nice person she is also really energetic all the time also i liked her in the anime she was well done.

These were some extra episodes tacked on the end for the DVD, and so they didn't have much to do with the overall themes. The first was a trip for some coffee. I didn't think it was that funny, and the story wasn't too engaging, so it was definitely the weaker half. The second episode was about the rich girl graduating to riding motorcycles on her own and it included a nice plot about her butler, who is revealed to have been a crossdresser in his youth, or...perhaps even trans. Which was cool. I don't think it matched the series at its best, but the second OVA was by far the stronger of these. perhaps even trans. Which was cool.

Buta,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13169/Buta,"[""I don't get why everyone associates this one-off as a furry anime. Have none of you seen Ducktales, Rescue Rangers, Animaniacs, Tiny Toons, Looney Tunes, or Tom and Jerry??? They are anthropomorphic animals. Big deal. It didn't focus on anything sexual or anything related to furries. It just so happened that all of the characters were animals.I really liked this one-off. I wish they would have made a series for it because I enjoyed the characters and wanted them to develop more. I was engaged in the story even though there wasn't really much to go off of. The animation is enjoyable as well....It isn't the greatest thing out there but it wasn't horrible either.The characters were pretty cliche but that is fine because it worked out. It was more about the relationship that the samurai pig and kid fox were developing.I would definitely recommend this short to friends and fellow lovers of anime because I enjoyed it so much.There was a period during the short that I was wondering how long it was going to take to get to the end. Chalk that up to boredom or whatever, but I feel like I was amazed that the short was actually the length of a regular anime episode.

Except the samurai is a pig. And the boy is a fox.Yes, all the characters in Buta are anthropomorphised animals. Anthropomorphisation does have narrative purpose beyond trying to appeal to furries. Sometimes it’s about grafting these animal traits onto human characters to emphasise that characteristic. Sometimes it’s about distancing us from the reality of events so we’re able to take a step back from the reality and spend more time analyzing the symbolism which is the reason why Night on...the Galactic Railroad decided to turn its brothers into cats.In Buta, it doesn’t really serve any purpose. If anything, it cheapened its story because turning the characters into animals distanced me from them enough that I didn’t really care about them. At least, that’s my theory as to why I never got into Buta. It could have just been the story was boring. But I’m rather baffled as to why they decided to go the anthropomorphised animals route anyway, so I’m going to blame it on that.Verdict: Skip the Galactic Railroad decided to turn its brothers into cats.In Buta, it doesn’t really serve any purpose.

The story is very simple, wealthy family gets attacked by pirates for an item they have and one of the children is taken away, only wanting to get the item back and get a little revenge for what had happened. Along the way, he hires a sword for hire to help him. The reason I didn’t start out with the sword for hire, Buta, was because the show doesn’t start out with him and yet both characters seem to take on the feeling of...what a main character is supposed to be for different reasons.Let’s talk about the main characters now I guess. First we have the little fox boy who is trying to get his map back from pirates. We never get an actual name for him; just that he is the oldest child of his family so will end up getting the map on his birthday. He is just like a normal child who was raised in a loving home; naïve, kind, and knows what is right from wrong. The second main character is Buta, the sword for hire. He is pretty much the exact opposite of the little fox. He is slightly dirty, worried more about surviving then doing the right thing, and is always looking for a way to make money. This doesn’t make him a bad guy though as the show has tried hard to show that. It just shows the difference between the privileged and the not so privileged without demonizing the two.There is one group of characters that I sort of feel really did not need to be in the show, and that’s Guppi and her group. Guppi is a female thief who just didn’t seem to fit into the story at all. Her and her group just seemed to pop up every once in a while. I think there are only like three or four scenes with them and it’s just like they were there for comedy relief.The animation is very beautiful; something I would be proud to put next to Studio Ghibli to compare though I do believe Buta was not made by hand. The colors are very bright during the happy points and pushed back slightly when they need to be in order to match the scene that it was trying to portray. The anthropomorphic creatures are very simple but it almost adds to the charm the movie was trying to portray as this is a movie supposed to be meant for all ages. The only problem I had with the design is that the dried fish did not look like dried fish. It’s a very small problem to me but the final part had it as a main point and I just couldn’t understand what they were doing till the fox said they were dried fish.The Japanese voice acting was really nice to hear surprisingly. I don’t normally say that as it’s a little harsh on my ears being a non native speaker but this show’s tone was actually quite nice. The story was slow enough that I could read the subtitles fast enough without stopping the show and the voice acting had a nice tone that made it rather enjoyable. what a main character is supposed to be for different reasons.Let’s talk about the main characters now I guess.

Bad Boys,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6096/Bad_Boys,"[""Just an awesome unknown gem of a series, not to the extent of an FLCL or some masterpiece in the rough, but a very important OVA that tackles a very rarely handled topic of Biker gangs in anime.The 1st episode is an awesome tale about how a boy from a rich family follows his interests to become a biker after being inspired by the Hiroshima Knights, but he soon discovers that the biker life isn't what he hoped it would be.The episodes that follow are just as awesome as they take the story in new directions.Really if you're a fan of Sons...of Anarchy or are just really interested in the biker gang theme than this Anime will really appeal to you.The art I would say can be half and half, sometimes you could get an absolutely awesome use of a fight scene animation and on others, the wacky comedy could just fall flat on its face with this derpy look the characters make that is quite unappealing I would say.Sound is fair but nothing too outstanding, it has a pretty cool OST and a few good songs to boot, but I wouldn't say the anime's strength is in it's sound.Now the Characters in this anime are quite fun and cool, and if your a VA nerd like I am you will soon realize that this OVA series is stacked with talent and they all deliver and end up making the characters so much more memorable because of it.The main characters do feel like a bonding team over the course of the show and the villains all have a unique feel to them that really drives home the importance for our main cast to defeat.I really enjoyed this series.

Please check it out if you like Biker themed shows."", 'As someone who loves the manga, I appreciate what they did with this adaption. The anime has great music, they didn’t change the art style from the manga, and the characters are still the beloved characters from the manga that I recognize and adore.This is definitely a classic delinquent story and it’s a fun little series but it also tackles a lot of difficult topics like; r*pe, violence, and etc. Because it’s an older work, I’d say the topic of r*pe wasn’t handled very well so if that is a possible trigger, stay away from this.Other than that, it’s very difficult to find...the entirety of the series. I’m someone who’s definitely willing to pay to watch what I want but I can’t even figure out where to do that. It’s not on Funimation, Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime, Hulu, or Netflix. The only way I was able to find out where to watch the entire thing is on YouTube by searching up Bad Boys OVA… and sadly there are no English Subtitles. If you can’t speak Japanese other websites definitely have them but only the first three episodes, they do not have all five. I also found the DVD’s on EBay but I’m definitely not spending 170 something on a show that only has 5 episodes. I know that if you put the 5 episodes together it’s basically a super long movie but even so, I somehow doubt it has English subtitles. So I’d be spending all of that money, for what?If you want to consume more of the story I think it’s definitely less of a hassle to read the manga. Although the first few chapters are very strange, it gets so much better. I wish that I could finish the anime so if anyone has some tips to find the rest of the anime, I’d love the help. Otherwise, from what I’ve seen so far, it’s a great adaption. It cuts out some of the weirdo stuff from the beginning of the story and one of the worst characters in the series so it flourishes in a way the manga didn’t when it first started out. It has the charm, from the manga,  that kept me binge reading. It’s a wonderful series. Definitely watch it or read it. 9/10 highly recommend. the entirety of the series.

If you can’t speak Japanese other websites definitely have them but only the first three episodes, they do not have all five. I also found the DVD’s on EBay but I’m definitely not spending 170 something on a show that only has 5 episodes. I know that if you put the 5 episodes together it’s basically a super long movie but even so, I somehow doubt it has English subtitles. So I’d be spending all of that money, for what?If you want to consume more of the story I think it’s definitely less of a hassle to read the manga. Although the first few chapters are very strange, it gets so much better. I wish that I could finish the anime so if anyone has some tips to find the rest of the anime, I’d love the help. Otherwise, from what I’ve seen so far, it’s a great adaption. It cuts out some of the weirdo stuff from the beginning of the story and one of the worst characters in the series so it flourishes in a way the manga didn’t when it first started out. It has the charm, from the manga,  that kept me binge reading. It’s a wonderful series. Definitely watch it or read it. 9/10 highly recommend.']"
Centaur no Nayami,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34525/Centaur_no_Nayami,"['Centaur\'s Worries is one of the most unique shows to come out in a while. It\'s a CGDCT show that has just as much focus on social commentary as it does on cute girls. It can go from calm and peaceful, to scenes that hint at the more dark underpinnings of the world. It\'s uniquely itself and that\'s something that I can appreciate.In a medium that seems more and more focused on being polished and pretty, Centaur\'s Worries is exceedingly minimalistic. The production values are weak and there is very little that is added in sound or animation that really makes it shine. In...fact, the only sound quality that they really have is budget sound samples that feel massively outdated. They frequently forgo background music and just have the characters speaking. When they do include background music it feels ripped from at least ten years prior. While it may sound lackluster, and I could certainly understand someone seeing it as that, I actually feel like the minimalist production values help create a feeling of nostalgia in the show. While the show takes place in the modern age, there are several references towards times that are passed and it invokes the feeling of something that\'s thirty years prior. It creates an interesting feeling where the show feels of a time period in the past but also feels current. It\'s something that I personally enjoy as it crafts a unique mood and atmosphere, one that is more than just being comfy.I also really liked how willing Centaur\'s Worries was to diversify up what was shown in the show. While most shows, especially CGDCT shows, stick to one general idea, Centaur did not do that. Centaur had, of course, the normal CGDCT shenanigans but it also separated them out between it\'s cast so that it wasn\'t just the main girls that got the time to shine. There was also family life that got highlighted, as well as the antics of three adorable young catgirl triplets, the mischief they got into and their relations with their family. The show also went so far as to include lewd moments, one of which I was surprised they even got to show on air. Not to mention some episodes with yuri kisses, as well as a general acceptance of yuri ships in general. The way that it portrayed the yuri ships was quite nice as it felt like there were several ships in the show that were canonically backed up and weren\'t there just for fanservice or seen as ""just a phase"". It felt as real and serious as a real high school relationship.And the cherry on the top was the social commentary. Centaur\'s Worries uses its unique world to craft interesting tales about trying to get society to work together when there are so many differences in those that inhabit it. There are lots of interesting tales like the hints of how much effort it takes to build a peaceful diverse society and keep it working as different issues arise from having a diverse society. One of the most interesting stories of Centaur\'s Worries is when it tackles its version of the Holocaust. It does the unthinkable by actually adding an interesting twist to the story and providing interesting social commentary to a subject matter that\'s so easy to abuse and get out of hand. Nuance is where Centaur shines. It\'s not overly preachy. I\'m not even sure what its overall message is. Rather it feels like a case study for all these ideas. An exploration of the ways that people can act and try to craft a society with people with so many differences. And I think it does that really well and really fairly. I might not agree with everything that is stated, but whether I agree with what\'s said or not I do think it\'s expressed in an interesting compelling way that can get one to think.Interestingly enough for a CGDCT show Centaur\'s Worries doesn\'t have that good of characters. While I personally like them and while I do like the interactions between them, they aren\'t the most notable characters. They thrive the best by virtue of being together and being in such a rich setting filled with nostalgia and nuance. They\'re fun to watch overall and they are likeable, but they aren\'t exactly well written. Each character only works because they\'re so well put with the other characters that they\'re around. And while ultimately I think that\'s good and certainly decent enough especially with all the other elements it does so well, it is a step down from other CGDCT shows which are able to not only have their characters shine in interactions but also have them shine on their own.It\'s not the prototypical CGDCT but I think it\'s great at what it does. Diversity of content personally is something I really like to see, and its unique flavor is something I very much liked. While the more SoL moments could get a bit boring they were also charming and nostalgic and in the end fostered a unique atmosphere for Centaur that I think was really well done. I personally love unique shows like these that just stick to what they want to be and do that well, and Centaur\'s Worries fits that to a T.

In the manga the history and racism plays a big part and they did a little bit of that with the world war two stuff, but there was so much more they could have done that I would have loved to see animated. In my opinion the most interesting part they didn't animated and My favorite was the part of the manga when hime gets teleported to the regular world with regular humans, but its in the medieval times and...they think shes some kind of demon. I was hoping the whole time watching this that it would show up but never did. Disappointed overall but it showed some good stuff, was a whole lot more slice of life than I expected. if what I explained seems interesting please read the manga its really good.  Overall 6/10 they think shes some kind of demon. I was hoping the whole time watching this that it would show up but never did.

A Centaur\'s Life, starting from the very first episode, has always had a different atmosphere to it than I initially expected. But it works.You go into this series expecting moe monster-girl blob that has already been done with some success recently. But what you don\'t expect is all the semi-dark undertones to this universe and all of the world-building they inject into it. As you\'re watching the show it feels like an innocent, relaxed slice-of-life with an interesting gimmick... up to the point when the situation very nonchalantly...gets very real. Those surprises are really what keep me coming back for more.The Art and Sound is pretty standard but doesn\'t distract you from enjoying the show itself. The style feels very innocent, the colors are mainly pastel, and while I\'m sure the music is there, I haven\'t really noticed it. These do their job to come together and work towards catching you off-guard.The characters themselves are actually pretty normal in spite of not being ""human"". When their differences are not being pointed out, they all feel very natural and at times relatable. They\'re like us and have personal lives and personal problems and we get to see some of this without making it overly dramatic or exaggerated. This is something I can appreciate.All-in-all, I\'ve been enjoying each episode of A Centaur\'s Life on my lazy Sundays. Rather than going into this series expecting a linear plot, try to just let yourself be immersed in the world it\'s trying to show you. It has themes built in that are good food for thought and it\'s just a relaxing show in-and-of-itself. If you aren\'t looking for something ridiculous or action-oriented, give this one a try at least. gets very real.

A title like “Centaur no Nayami” (A Centaur’s Life) sounds intriguing as we take a look at the life of a centaur. For a show like this, it really brings out some unique dynamics. It succeeds at crafting a show that captures the elements of slice of life while adding touches of fantasy and also some other unexpected surprises.Before we get to the what, who, how, or why, it’s important to understand that the anime isn’t a full adaptation of the manga. The manga...is actually ongoing and this anime only has 12 episodes. What does that mean? It basically means that the anime has the kit of delivering its ideas but not covering everything. However, it doesn’t need to either because this series has enough to show what’s needed.My early impression of the show comes from the idea of slice of life recreation. In most slice of life series, you get the depiction of everyday life activities revolving a circle of characters. Centaur no Nayari isn’t too different as it follows the everyday adventures of centaur girl Himeno Kimihara and her friends. What is different is that they aren’t entirely human. Her friend Nozomi Gokuraku is a demon girl while Kyouko Naraku is a half Satyr. Get what I mean? Understandably, this show runs the risk of looking like a joke when characters are difficult to accept at first. However, what this anime did succeed in is how it explores the lives of these characters. Similar to us, they go to school, shopping, studying, and gossip about romance. To be honest, this anime has an interesting concept. I’ve seen a bunch of “monster girls” theme shows in recent years but one like this one doesn’t rely on cheap cardboard stories to do the work. It uses this characters and get us to invest in them.One of the more charming character cast in this anime is the family with Manami Mitama and her younger sisters. Manami is a mature angel girl and is also class president of Nozomi’s class. She looks after her family and is responsible despite not always been there for them. The character chemistry between the younger kids is quite realistic and relatable as we see how they behave in everyday life activities. It also expands to the older characters as we some of their social issues. These include social anxiety, dealing trouble with school, etc. Remember that thing I mentioned about the most difficult thing in life? It’s to live in it and everyone has their problems.When it comes to world building, I can honestly confess that this anime capitalized in this field. It’s genuinely well-crafted in this alternative setting. The show makes its world look like our own with its schools, parks, shopping centers, hospitals, among others. Even in an alternate timeline, we get to see how that world is similar to our own. In the meantime, anyone coming into this anime might probably think “but this anime seems too lighthearted for its own good!” In some sense, it does feel that way but the show is also disguises itself with its sensible subjects. These include fantasy racism, political affairs, and laws of society. One particular episode also gets quite grim with Holocaust themes that show a darker side of this show. So in essence, not everything is bubbly as one might expect. Despite being tagged as a slice of life show, it’s serious enough to offer surprises.Now I have to admit, this anime feels like it’s more targeted a specific audience so people looking for some complex plot or characterization may not be satisfied. The plot itself also feels very loose as the everyday life adventures jumps around. Despite Himeno and her friends being the main characters, there are occasionally some episodes that doesn’t even feature them at all. There will also be some characters that you’ll find more or less likeable than others. The comedy itself is very lighthearted but on occasions can feel dry.Adapted by Haoliners Animation, I can’t really blame anyone that come into this show with low expectations. Their lineup of projects (Gin no Guardian, Cheating Craft, Hitori no Shita) aren’t visually appealing from the past impressions. For this anime, I have mixed thoughts about the quality as character designs look very basic. The camera work also lacks focus and rarely capitalizes on important scenes. There’s also some fan service in particular with mermaid species and bath scenes. In the meantime, I can’t really say that the anime is pleasing to the eye. If you take a look at the backgrounds and sceneries, you’ll quickly notice why.On another technical side, Centaur no Nayami’s music function as it needs to be. The theme songs has substance but doesn’t really stand out much to remember by. The OST will usually get you into a quiet mood as slice of life shows should. However, I can’t say it’s very impressive either. On the other hand, character voices deserve some praise especially for the talent of voicing children. Quetzalcoatl’s voice is also quite appealing as it really brings out her personality.Watching Centaur no Nayami is like playing a video game that throws surprises at you when you don’t expect it. To me, this show is a surprise with its ideas. It recreates the slice of life genre while maintaining a realistic world with its characters. Yes, don’t expect much from its story. It’s underdeveloped and to be honest, this show’s storytelling is on the weaker side. Still, this anime excels at what it does and that’s bringing an inventive show on the table. is actually ongoing and this anime only has 12 episodes. What does that mean?

I haven't seen a lot of anime's that tackle social issues like this. Also the different races and how their society is depicted is unique. The art is good and I like the voice actors.

It\'s like Lucky Charms- 95% bland/boring filler, with some marshmellow-y cute interactions sprinkled in here and there (and most of them centered around the snake girl, Sassassul...).The story is boring, even for a slice-of-life anime, the animation...looks really cheap and borderline unfinished most of the time, and all of the character designs are completely uninteresting. I don\'t know how you can even achieve that in a monster girl anime, but they did. None of the characters look interesting enough to look at for more than a brief moment.Also, some of the character design choices for the different species are a bit... odd. Such as how the angels have halos made of hair (for some reason), or how the mermaids all have thigh-gaps, or how that one chubby cat-dude looks like a blob fish for no reason, or how all the centaurs and goat-people have really long ears that make them look like donkeys.I\'m currently in school for animation and character design, and I can safely say that I can see right through the artist\'s bullshit. I can tell that they wanted to make their monster girls look unique from other artists\' monster girls, but they aren\'t actually creative enough to come up with anything actually interesting.Although, having taken a quick look at the manga, the mangaka\'s art style does help a little with this problem. However, as stated before, the animation in this anime looks very cheap, so it makes this defect highly visible.Overall, it\'s just extremely boring and cheap. Watch this if you like Lucky Charms with half as many marshmallows as usual, or don\'t if you actually want to spend your time watching something interesting.If you\'re interested in actually high-quality monster girl anime, go watch ""Interviews with Monster Girls,"" or ""Miss Kobayshi\'s Dragon Maid.""(or ""Monster Musume"" if you\'re willing/like to watch sexual stuff. I especially recommend the manga, it\'s very good!)TL/DR: Boring and cheap-looking.Thank you for reading! <3 looks really cheap and borderline unfinished most of the time, and all of the character designs are completely uninteresting.

However, what struck me as incredible in this series is that it tackles very serious topic that in the 21st Century. The mythical creatures that coexist in this anime reflect the behaviors of any other high school anime however after each episode serious topics such as sexuality, questioning of social norms, cultural differences and self exploration are all embedded in the seemingly innocent shojo comedy.THE ANIME IS GOOD and it doesn't matter if you're and fan of light, stupid comedy like me (..luckyStarIsTheBestAnimu) or a...Feminist Human rights activist.... Then again it has a decent amount of fan service for the male audience as well so everyone can enjoy it.Personally, as a viewer who likes to enjoy slice of life as an escape from the every day life, it surprised me that such difficult and controversial issues can still be presented in an enjoyable way and so I highly recommend this series.Apart from the serious and thought provoking content the art style is ADORABLE (disclaimer you may not agree blah blah blah ..). It's sweet impressively so because its not easy to present mythical monsters as cute high school students but never the less they are gorgeous. ^^The op is catchy but I prefer the ending as in my opinion the vocals are awesome and the song more melodic.

I had a few chuckles. The idea of an alternate reality of these types of humanoids is interesting at least. But nothing exciting happens.

And this concept they keep pushing of ""everyone\'s equal and that makes the world better and nothing is wrong"" seems to be shoved into the viewers face constantly. It\'s funny they try to say their utopia is great while sending people to jail for just speaking, haha. This is a real depiction of...Nazi Germany.

It incorporates serious, dark elements that are generally uncalled for, yet very intentional. The author has a creative vision and tendency, but also knows their strength and weaknesses, so he made a cute girls doing cute things that is much more than slice of life. It\'s great, it\'s cute but at the same time feeling thoughtful and be shocking, but do not dwell on the shock and return to the state of equilibrium. Yet the fact that those elements are there, observable and contrasted to the CGDCT tone,...makes everything seems very uncomfortable, even as you go mellow from the CGDCT. It really shows the slices, in slice of life.Unfortunately, the animation adaption is horrendous.The show was basically left hanging out to dry, by essentially outsourced it oversea to China, who didn\'t do a very good job at bringing it to life. The art of the comic is great, but not at the level that needed massive budget to animate. But, they need to completely capture the original material quality character\'s illustration. They couldn\'t even do that. The characters illustration doesn\'t translate well despite decent original design. The background is lifeless, bloodless, as if I was sent back to the early, mid 2000s animation quality. The background back then was at least stylistically hand drawn, with brush and and all. The worst sin of the animation, to me, is the awkward mouth movement. I suspect most of that was due to the Chinese animation studio having very little experience with how the mouth should move because they don\'t speak Japanese, so they relegated to just adding open and close. The key animations might have been done in Japan, then shipped to China for frames in between and colouring. The one part that the Chinese did well seem to be the ""action"" parts, such as Hime falling from the platform, jumping, galloping and characters flying around, kicking. This studio could do a much better job at animating a dumb, generic shounen action show than be given a really subtle CGDCT.The sound quality is nothing to write home about. The music is largely forgettable and the voice acting is capable, albeit adding little to the show, due to the nature of it and the distance between where it was animated and where the VAs are. A good counter example is Konosuba, where the animation became much more engrossed and inspired by the voice actors efforts, turning a relatively poorly animated show into a gem, as the studio figured out where to focus their efforts into.I don\'t think there\'s much to be said about the story, because I advice against watching the show and recommend just picking up the comic. It was adapted without changing very much, which is both good and bad. What\'s great has been reflected by other reviews, who praised the show for world building and adding layers to CGDCT. I won\'t go onto too much details, people can already take it in.There\'s an obsession with ""policing"" equality, making sure nobody is offending anybody. Yet, for all of the policing, there were still huge distrust of outsiders, particularly towards the 2 reptiles races. The funny Nazi part also alludes to the fact that, even if humanity all look the same, discrimination will still happen, we would just find things different about ourselves to fight over. You can explore more of that topic by reading about Rwandan genocide, where the word genocide met an unfortunate circumstance. Genos indicates race, people, yet the Tutsi and Hutu are basically physically indistinguishable, leading to many mistaken victims and survivors due to the killers not being able to tell them apart. That\'s great food for thought, if one is in the mood for such. Else, the viewer can continue enjoying cute girls doing cute things being poorly animated.Another part of CGDCT being twisted, not to the point of deconstruction, is slice of life, CGDCT can have a lot of depths, that can be explored, yet, they are not being used for drama. This is in contrast to the great Maeda\'s modus operandi. There are many notable parts, such as Hime the centaur\'s red hair origin, or the class president\'s family circumstances. The class president is a notable character with a lot of shocking character. Her family is cute, but she\'s head strong, mature, bossy and motherly, not just because she\'s a CGDCT character, ""perfect class president"" type; but she has to be this way because her father is essentially a delusional deadbeat dad, her mother passed away living a weak child, and she has to take care of a bunch of noisy, spoiled and energetic little sisters. The comic frequently contrasted her family circumstances to Hime, who\'s spoiled but nice, because she was brought up in a loving family. Yet, these details always take a backseat to the cute girls doing cute things, because at the end of the day, it is still slice of life, and not served as the basis for drama and shock moment like what Maeda does.That\'s just a taste of what\'s to come in the comic, which had a lot more interesting details about the world and the author\'s world view. I highly recommend that. The animation, not so much. Centaur no Nayami the animation is a train wreck, and should be avoided if possible.

For this one, it’s the fact that everyone is a descendent of the four legged animals instead of our world that descended from the two legged one. Don’t ask me how this all works out, they don’t fully explain how and why most of them look very humanoid with just animal things tacked onto them, it just works out that way in the show.There are a LOT of characters in this anime and although I would consider three (or four) of them as...main characters, they are not always main in the stories that are played out. That’s why going through the characters personalities is really hard to do. There really wasn’t any character I actually did not like which is extremely rare; normally there is at least one I don’t like. Even the really small children like the Mitama triplets weren’t as annoying as I thought they would be. I do think my favorite was actually Quetzalcoatl Sassassul, the snake girl from Antarctica. She came in about half way through the show and was a bit of fresh air as her culture was so different then what we had seen for the first half of the show.I know what you guys are thinking; the fact that it’s a slice of life means that we are going to get some rather random comedy and slap stick happening. You would be right, we do get some of that but I want to talk now about something that actually makes this show more then just a little slice of life/school life anime. They dive a little into the culture we have now, a culture filled with people trying to be politically correct. Their world has had many problems with ‘species’ discrimination. Different species were used as slaves, Centaurs were used as normal horses, fights would break out because of religion, and basically a similar history as our world. They even had their own Hitler and holocaust that they dive a tiny bit into. Because of this, the present day has a lot of times where they are worried about being politically correct. They are so worried about it, that if someone says or does something even remotely ‘racist’ in their eyes, they have to go to special classes to learn how not to be.The artwork is pretty standard. Again, it’s hard to talk about when it looks like every other show out there for slice of life. I like how they didn’t go overly into fan service like how most ‘monster girls’ anime ends up. There is fan service but they don’t focus too heavily on it. Another thing that I love is that some of these races are not fully traditionally what we would think when we think ‘snake girl’ or ‘mermaid’. Snake girl does not mean head up is human; it means it’s basically a normal snake with arms and legs basically. While the mermaids are interestingly designed, I question the thigh gap that they created as it just doesn’t seem to be an evolutionary reason for it. So far, the only reason I see for them is for those who have that small fetish and for them to wear undergarments when the land people come (they seem to live through a very nudist sort of life style otherwise).The English voice acting was actually not that bad surprisingly, especially since most of the names on the list were ones I didn’t recognize. None of the voice actors really stood out from any other, they were pretty much all good for the characters they were playing, which doesn’t help me know who to actually talk about. The music was basic standard slice of life with nothing standing out which I feel was a missed opportunity.Overall, I actually like the show and really hope that they come out with another season. I feel like they only scratched the surface of that world and all the crazy races within it. It had the right amount of fan service to keep people entertained without being overwhelmingly in your face and the parts that I had problems with where rather minor. The show makes you think, not only of the world you’re watching but a little bit of our own world with the parallels it highlights which makes it great for those interested in culture.

This anime definitely deserves more love and attention. 💖💖💖Do not be fooled by the cutesy sparkly cover art and anime art 💖. They are cute and sparkly, but they really do touch on pretty deep subjects pertaining to discrimination (be it sexism/racism) and human nature (including religion, superstitions etc.). It actually saddens me quite a bit comparing their universe to ours....I also love the techniques and subtlety they used to deliver such heavy message but still managing to keep...it lighthearted. If you\'ve been fighting for justice be it against racism, sexism or any other kind of discrimination, you would be delighted to know that\'s this anime does an awesome job pointing out the flaws in our society while still having the show be entertaining.Definitely one of the best anime so far when it comes to morality and human nature. 💖Also, the best anime for this season in my opinion. 💖 it lighthearted.

Spoilers ahead!)Centaur no Nayami features, coincidentally enough, a centaur as its leading character. Thinking about centaurs got me thinking about horses, and thinking about horses got me thinking about how I’ve never gone horseback riding.It’s interesting to think about how traveling by that animal hundreds of years ago was the norm. People still do so for fun of course, and horse-drawn carriages are still a thing in bustling cities for those that desire a romantic escape. But riding a horse is no longer a necessity to go out and see the world.In Centaur no Nayami’s world,...if a person there were to ride a centaur, let alone talk about doing so, they could potentially be arrested for disrupting the peace. But, thankfully, no peace disruption goes down in this mildly interesting anime.STORYWhile “nayami” translates better into English as “worry,” the localized title for Centaur no Nayami is A Centaur’s Life. That last word homes in on the anime’s structure, a structure that fans of this medium have come to equate with laidback shenanigans and an episodic format overall. That’s right: the tried-and-true slice-of-life genre.Despite relying on the title earlier, this anime is not strictly about Hime the centaur’s daily troubles. Rather it’s about her own worries and those of the people closely or indirectly related to her. Nevertheless, it is purely slice-of-life. From the very first kiss to the final arm-wrestling match, the characters take part in events that barely reach above the mundane and the regular throughout the season. Naming flowers, dating, glimpsing at family life. See? Simple, normal stuff.The twist with these events, however, is the fact that Hime and the others are less human and more hybrids. Goat people. Snake people. Frog people. Angels. Mermaids. And, of course, centaurs. They go to school, hang out on the weekends, and take part in various activities like any other normal person, but they also deal with their own problems, too.Their abnormalities (or, to them, their normalities, a made-up word for argument’s sake) become a key part of Centaur no Nayami. In depicting them, the show builds its world through simple yet effective means. The design of cars made for centaurs. Glasses that wrap over the heads of those with ears in the same spot. Scary, grotesque movies that put snakes in a negative light. When in doubt, the anime ties in its strange world through the same strange creatures that inhabit it.On the opposite end, the anime can also take it to a realistic level of sorts. For instance, mermen (or maybe merbutlers) find clothed bodies more attractive than naked ones. It just so happens that their mermaid counterparts only cover their chests (with bathing suits) when outsiders visit their watery lands, so that element of imagination which can guide the libido works overtime for this aquatic species.During rare occasions, the show combines both the abnormalities and the realism to create some rather extreme scenarios. It can go anywhere from a Holocaust analogy that discusses the mistreatment of those different from others to young women simply and understandably curious about their own female anatomy.Such extremes are surprisingly not out of place, though. As the show unfolds, the audience starts to take note of an underlying motif, a darker subtext whose nature seems alarming on a moral and philosophical level. Talking points about forced patterns, societal equivalence, and unseen control pop up at a semi-frequent rate that hint at a world whose outer shine hides its inner oddities.For instance, shows and books for kids take on democratic motifs for early subliminal messaging. Ominous officials leer from afar as well, making sure teachers inform their students that equality matters more than life itself. The “Department of the Interior’s Bureau for the Conservation of Normal Society” also outright bans particular books they deem too discriminatory. And don’t forget about missing hair halos constituting a potential violation of civil conduct. This dark subtext within Centaur no Nayami gives the show a slight spin that lets it stand out when it otherwise wouldn’t, for wickedness lurks beneath the fur and the feathers.Intentional or not, such wicked content promotes a welcomed progressive attitude as a neat side-effect. Homosexual relationships are not looked down upon whatsoever, and the show even points out how the earlier use of “snake people” is derogatory when the proper term “Antarcticans” should be used instead. These details are small within the anime when compared to the slice-of-life antics or the larger subtext, but they once again spin Centaur no Nayami towards making a name for itself.Unfortunately, that darkness and this progressiveness isn’t really explored. Often, the events and the characters bring up these thoughts in passing or as an addendum, and then the episode continues onward as if they weren’t brought up at all. It leaves these interesting tidbits on the wayside, failing to address their thematic implications let alone diving headfirst into these topics.Despite the anime not expanding on them to a meaningful extent, it clearly does a lot right with its story anyway. It maintains focus. It takes advantage of its premise. It builds its world. It features different ideas to begin with. Overall, the show gallops, slithers, and flies ahead without too much trouble.ART & ANIMATIONCentaur no Nayami, due to the diverse species that walk among its streets and its buildings, showcases many different designs for the inhabitants of this world. Wings, horns, legs, ears. They combine with various skin tones and body builds to diversify its crowd as much as their “normal” government would likely tout.It doesn’t take long for the artistry to waver, though. Background people and even the frontrunners go off model too noticeably at times. Furthermore, the animation, while never its strong suit, worsens despite the events not involving much movement in the first place. Not that these details ruin the experience, but they still take away from the anime’s total execution.Moreover, and worse still, the anime decides on other visual elements that further hurt its chances. Pale, bright lighting washes out the presentation, hampering the visuals with a boring aesthetic. The setting does not help either as Centaur no Nayami ignores any extra flair and instead sticks with the lackluster school grounds. And it does not use any interesting cinematic techniques to curtail some of these problems, leaving them wide open as a result.To be fair, this very straightforward presentation of the show’s content coincides with its slice-of-life direction. However, it sacrifices intrigue for a whole lot of dullness that keeps it from reaching a higher potential.Still, the anime demonstrates flashes of care here and there. When the gang talk about Hime’s ancestry, an old-fashioned filter separates the past from the present. It also targets its subtext, too. As a scene transition in episode three, the crosswalk symbols exchange human hands and human walking poses for a generalized green triangle and red square to forego any perceived discrimination.The wavering artistry and the poor visual elements sadly outweigh these smaller flashes and even the designs. Altogether, the anime simply lacks an engaging artistic direction when it sorely needs it.CHARACTERSIn Centaur no Nayami, what one sees isn’t always what one gets. Somewhat.That’s not immediately obvious. With its heavy slice-of-life roots, Hime and the others rarely deviate from their initial impressions. She’s the kindhearted “princess” of the school, Manami acts as a mother of sorts as she looks after both the students and her sisters, and so on. The anime isn’t interested in exploring these characters in a dramatic, traditional sense, and it doesn’t need to. Instead, their interactions and reactions to their different daily situations bring out more of their characteristics.For example, Hime has (relevantly) massive insecurities about her own body that sometimes dictate her decisions. Manami, in her free time, works as a (fake) exorcist and questions her father’s motivations when it comes to his painting hobby. In both cases here, the characters reveal new sides to themselves that were not present on the surface, getting at that “somewhat” caveat from earlier.An important note considering their species. As a centaur, people may expect Hime to act confident and strong, but she’s as delicate as a butterfly. Similarly, Manami may be an angel, but she’s far from angelic as she berates (with love) those close to her with a firm foot. These “masked” sides to the characters follow the story’s own “masked” content, creating some parallels that form another layer for the anime to build upon.Suu the Antarctican snake embodies this idea the most. She arrives late at about the halfway point of the season, representing a “scary” foreigner to the other characters. Yet interactions with her turn that description into a false assumption. Instead, she introduces contrast, perspective, and dialogue in a fair way that go against what the characters and the show normally portray while still demonstrating that she is just like them at the end of the day.Moreover, Suu’s presence leads to further commentary about the darker subtext as she shares knowledge about her people. Not to mention how her willingness to learn about their cultures, too, ignites a give-and-take that exposes more about them and the world at large.Nozomi and Kyouko, Hime’s two best friends, also get at this “masked” idea. The demon Nozomi has an innocence about her, and the goat-girl Kyouko isn’t loud or energetic but instead quiet and reserved. Sadly, they also highlight a big problem with the cast: plain to a fault. Be it these two or Suu or Manami or Hime, these cast members lack quirky, riveting qualities. Without such qualities, the show prevents them from becoming interesting individuals let alone memorable characters.That setup is part of the point of Centaur no Nayami. From their point of view, they aren’t meant to be weird hybrids but rather regular, normal people. Just as it was with the artistry, though, this normalcy dulls their presence and thus their impact within the anime, molding them into shapes too simplistic to call worthwhile.Regardless of their simplicity, they fit well within the confines of the anime, they follow the slice-of-life ideals put in place, and they at least have their dichotomies which flip their usual setups. Not too shabby for these unassuming group of girls.MUSIC & SOUNDBy far the best piece of music out of Centaur no Nayami, and arguably one of the best parts of the anime period, is the ending track. Titled “Edelweiss”, it soars like an angel. Very strong vocal delivery, background harmonizing, delicate instrumentation, grand atmosphere. It has the complete package. The catchy beat in the second half does not step on the song’s wings in-flight, and it even has a translated English version that replaces the normal Japanese one in episode nine.An interesting detail given that that episode features the Nazi side story. “Interesting” because the song “Edelweiss” is already a very famous song, played as a patriotic tribute in the face of Germany’s oppression during the critically acclaimed film The Sound of Music.Which extends to an even more interesting interpretation of Centaur no Nayami’s ED. Looking at the lyrics, it doesn’t seem as if they fit the anime, what with its talks about shadows and helixes and those titular flowers. However, a few lines hint at what it’s getting at: “Then even if the world were to forget me, I wouldn’t notice. / Having lived in fear of the wind, / I too begin to change again!”That is, on some level, the track argues for pushing back against the controlled sameness that permeates the anime’s content as not-so-subtle subtext. Indeed, an edelweiss – a small, white flower – symbolizes purity and individualism. Traits the characters in the show somewhat lose out on as their society pushes centaurs, snake people, and mermaids into the same category without their say which inadvertently stops them from fully expressing themselves.Too farfetched? Perhaps. But the anime includes that darker edge a lot. Plus, the stark contrast between the structure of this ED here to the rest of the anime is hard to ignore outright. So, at the minimum, it isn’t too crazy to imagine it having its own subtext, a purpose beyond just sounding nice to the ears.The ED aside, the rest of the sound work within Centaur no Nayami does not reach the same lofty heights, but they bring their own flavor regardless. The original soundtrack has its piano tunes and trumpet ensembles no doubt. But the xylophone sections feel the most comfortable, their smaller scope and their daintier notes aligning with the slice-of-life presentation. Extra animal noises, such as hooves on pavement and hissing tongues, add realism to the premise but are arguably expected anyway since not having them would leave the show in an unrefined state.Likewise, the voice-acting performances do not land anywhere too impressive, but the large reliance on novices for the majority of its major cast members is cool to see (or rather hear). Yuu Ayase as Suu at least deserves a small shoutout for her calm manner of speech.And not forgetting about the opening track, “Oshiete Darwin” follows its counterpart with a song whose composition doesn’t exactly translate to the mood of Centaur no Nayami itself. It blasts into existence with way too much loudness, but the playful vocals, silly sound-effects, and the quicker pace give it a lighter feel as the striking, futuristic instrumentation plays alongside these details. The lyrical content is not as nuanced or as intriguing as the ED, but references to “evolves”, “Gods”, “planet”, “dimension”, and “Balance” round out the OP with a scientific angle that underpins that ever-present subtext once more.With such a strong ED, and a solid OP, OST, and set of VA performances, the anime demonstrates a lot of execution in its music and its sound that go a long way towards supporting this project.ENJOYMENTI had a pretty okay time with this one.Having that Orwellian atmosphere present throughout the season kept my thoughts on the lookout even if its presence was not technically around at that moment. The yuri under-and-over tones also were right up my alley, being a big fan of the genre.I liked several of the characters, too. Hime was my favorite. Cute and kind, she did her best to live happy and carefree with the many people around her whom she called friends. Suu was also a favorite of mine; her calm composure and overall outlier status put her in a unique spot. And I cannot forget about Manami. She had an air of superiority, but her drive upheld true sincerity visible in nearly every interaction she had with those around her.Her trio of little sisters – Chinami, Chiho, and Chigusa (informally the Chi Sisters) – and Hime’s younger cousin Shino were adorable thanks to how they dealt with and responded to the teenagers around them. Kyouko and Nozomi were also a silly pair to have around. Their lowkey behavior and tomboyish actions (respectively) complemented Hime well to create in them a cool trio.Otherwise, the rest of the anime was meager to me. I was not too invested in the actual events taking place throughout the season. I did laugh at its jokes, but I didn’t find it hilarious. And I appreciate its subtext yet wish that it would have been more enlightening through greater thematic depth. So, when looking at everything as one big picture, I see this anime as neither amazing nor horrible but as a middling offering.Centaur no Nayami provides for its audience an average experience. Its plain narrative and plainer characters hide extra details. Nuanced musical pieces combat the boring artistic display. And the entertainment value balances itself out with both likable and forgettable elements. It’s worth the ride – but just the once.SUMMARYStory: Good, a purely slice-of-life tale builds a world featuring centaurs, snake people, angels, and mermaids as a darker subtext lurks nearbyArt & Animation: Bad, diversified designs and small additions to the presentation cannot outperform the waning artistry and the detrimental visual choicesCharacters: Fine, Hime, Suu, and the other girls have their own “masked” sides but are plain to a faultMusic & Sound: Good, a surprisingly intriguing ED soars high as a quirky OST, newcomer VA performances, and a “scientific” OP run on the ground not too far backEnjoyment: Fine, occasional yuri moments and likable characters match up against meagerness otherwiseFinal Score: 5/10 if a person there were to ride a centaur, let alone talk about doing so, they could potentially be arrested for disrupting the peace. But, thankfully, no peace disruption goes down in this mildly interesting anime.STORYWhile “nayami” translates better into English as “worry,” the localized title for Centaur no Nayami is A Centaur’s Life. That last word homes in on the anime’s structure, a structure that fans of this medium have come to equate with laidback shenanigans and an episodic format overall. That’s right: the tried-and-true slice-of-life genre.Despite relying on the title earlier, this anime is not strictly about Hime the centaur’s daily troubles. Rather it’s about her own worries and those of the people closely or indirectly related to her. Nevertheless, it is purely slice-of-life. From the very first kiss to the final arm-wrestling match, the characters take part in events that barely reach above the mundane and the regular throughout the season. Naming flowers, dating, glimpsing at family life. See? Simple, normal stuff.The twist with these events, however, is the fact that Hime and the others are less human and more hybrids. Goat people. Snake people. Frog people. Angels. Mermaids. And, of course, centaurs. They go to school, hang out on the weekends, and take part in various activities like any other normal person, but they also deal with their own problems, too.Their abnormalities (or, to them, their normalities, a made-up word for argument’s sake) become a key part of Centaur no Nayami. In depicting them, the show builds its world through simple yet effective means. The design of cars made for centaurs. Glasses that wrap over the heads of those with ears in the same spot. Scary, grotesque movies that put snakes in a negative light. When in doubt, the anime ties in its strange world through the same strange creatures that inhabit it.On the opposite end, the anime can also take it to a realistic level of sorts. For instance, mermen (or maybe merbutlers) find clothed bodies more attractive than naked ones. It just so happens that their mermaid counterparts only cover their chests (with bathing suits) when outsiders visit their watery lands, so that element of imagination which can guide the libido works overtime for this aquatic species.During rare occasions, the show combines both the abnormalities and the realism to create some rather extreme scenarios. It can go anywhere from a Holocaust analogy that discusses the mistreatment of those different from others to young women simply and understandably curious about their own female anatomy.Such extremes are surprisingly not out of place, though. As the show unfolds, the audience starts to take note of an underlying motif, a darker subtext whose nature seems alarming on a moral and philosophical level. Talking points about forced patterns, societal equivalence, and unseen control pop up at a semi-frequent rate that hint at a world whose outer shine hides its inner oddities.For instance, shows and books for kids take on democratic motifs for early subliminal messaging. Ominous officials leer from afar as well, making sure teachers inform their students that equality matters more than life itself. The “Department of the Interior’s Bureau for the Conservation of Normal Society” also outright bans particular books they deem too discriminatory. And don’t forget about missing hair halos constituting a potential violation of civil conduct. This dark subtext within Centaur no Nayami gives the show a slight spin that lets it stand out when it otherwise wouldn’t, for wickedness lurks beneath the fur and the feathers.Intentional or not, such wicked content promotes a welcomed progressive attitude as a neat side-effect. Homosexual relationships are not looked down upon whatsoever, and the show even points out how the earlier use of “snake people” is derogatory when the proper term “Antarcticans” should be used instead. These details are small within the anime when compared to the slice-of-life antics or the larger subtext, but they once again spin Centaur no Nayami towards making a name for itself.Unfortunately, that darkness and this progressiveness isn’t really explored. Often, the events and the characters bring up these thoughts in passing or as an addendum, and then the episode continues onward as if they weren’t brought up at all. It leaves these interesting tidbits on the wayside, failing to address their thematic implications let alone diving headfirst into these topics.Despite the anime not expanding on them to a meaningful extent, it clearly does a lot right with its story anyway. It maintains focus. It takes advantage of its premise. It builds its world. It features different ideas to begin with. Overall, the show gallops, slithers, and flies ahead without too much trouble.ART & ANIMATIONCentaur no Nayami, due to the diverse species that walk among its streets and its buildings, showcases many different designs for the inhabitants of this world. Wings, horns, legs, ears. They combine with various skin tones and body builds to diversify its crowd as much as their “normal” government would likely tout.It doesn’t take long for the artistry to waver, though. Background people and even the frontrunners go off model too noticeably at times. Furthermore, the animation, while never its strong suit, worsens despite the events not involving much movement in the first place. Not that these details ruin the experience, but they still take away from the anime’s total execution.Moreover, and worse still, the anime decides on other visual elements that further hurt its chances. Pale, bright lighting washes out the presentation, hampering the visuals with a boring aesthetic. The setting does not help either as Centaur no Nayami ignores any extra flair and instead sticks with the lackluster school grounds. And it does not use any interesting cinematic techniques to curtail some of these problems, leaving them wide open as a result.To be fair, this very straightforward presentation of the show’s content coincides with its slice-of-life direction. However, it sacrifices intrigue for a whole lot of dullness that keeps it from reaching a higher potential.Still, the anime demonstrates flashes of care here and there. When the gang talk about Hime’s ancestry, an old-fashioned filter separates the past from the present. It also targets its subtext, too. As a scene transition in episode three, the crosswalk symbols exchange human hands and human walking poses for a generalized green triangle and red square to forego any perceived discrimination.The wavering artistry and the poor visual elements sadly outweigh these smaller flashes and even the designs. Altogether, the anime simply lacks an engaging artistic direction when it sorely needs it.CHARACTERSIn Centaur no Nayami, what one sees isn’t always what one gets. Somewhat.That’s not immediately obvious. With its heavy slice-of-life roots, Hime and the others rarely deviate from their initial impressions. She’s the kindhearted “princess” of the school, Manami acts as a mother of sorts as she looks after both the students and her sisters, and so on. The anime isn’t interested in exploring these characters in a dramatic, traditional sense, and it doesn’t need to. Instead, their interactions and reactions to their different daily situations bring out more of their characteristics.For example, Hime has (relevantly) massive insecurities about her own body that sometimes dictate her decisions. Manami, in her free time, works as a (fake) exorcist and questions her father’s motivations when it comes to his painting hobby. In both cases here, the characters reveal new sides to themselves that were not present on the surface, getting at that “somewhat” caveat from earlier.An important note considering their species. As a centaur, people may expect Hime to act confident and strong, but she’s as delicate as a butterfly. Similarly, Manami may be an angel, but she’s far from angelic as she berates (with love) those close to her with a firm foot. These “masked” sides to the characters follow the story’s own “masked” content, creating some parallels that form another layer for the anime to build upon.Suu the Antarctican snake embodies this idea the most. She arrives late at about the halfway point of the season, representing a “scary” foreigner to the other characters. Yet interactions with her turn that description into a false assumption. Instead, she introduces contrast, perspective, and dialogue in a fair way that go against what the characters and the show normally portray while still demonstrating that she is just like them at the end of the day.Moreover, Suu’s presence leads to further commentary about the darker subtext as she shares knowledge about her people. Not to mention how her willingness to learn about their cultures, too, ignites a give-and-take that exposes more about them and the world at large.Nozomi and Kyouko, Hime’s two best friends, also get at this “masked” idea. The demon Nozomi has an innocence about her, and the goat-girl Kyouko isn’t loud or energetic but instead quiet and reserved. Sadly, they also highlight a big problem with the cast: plain to a fault. Be it these two or Suu or Manami or Hime, these cast members lack quirky, riveting qualities. Without such qualities, the show prevents them from becoming interesting individuals let alone memorable characters.That setup is part of the point of Centaur no Nayami. From their point of view, they aren’t meant to be weird hybrids but rather regular, normal people. Just as it was with the artistry, though, this normalcy dulls their presence and thus their impact within the anime, molding them into shapes too simplistic to call worthwhile.Regardless of their simplicity, they fit well within the confines of the anime, they follow the slice-of-life ideals put in place, and they at least have their dichotomies which flip their usual setups.

An alternate reality with supernatural looking creatures that mostly turn out to be more or less humans with completely non functional random attachments like wings that can\'t fly, stupidly giant ears on top of their heads, horns that don\'t even make sense, pointless tails attached halfway up their backs instead of anywhere near the human tailbone which is incidentally also equivalent of where normal real world animals have their tails.The core element seems to be the ""slice of life"" snapshot of an alternate reality school, this is also where the...few strong points can be found. Some conversations are a bit stiff but mostly it has a good flow going, whenever it doesn\'t run off with side characters leaving the main cast almost absent for entire episodes. You never get enough time with almost any of the important characters to get a good feel for them, neither do they leave much impression despite their hard to forget stupid looks.The most confusing and redundant thing tacked onto this mess is a boring and very lengthy world war flashback where these goofballs are supposed to be relatable enough to drag empathy out of the viewer and I may be over interpreting but it seems to be trying to teach some sort of moral thing in the midst of it as well. This along with the biology lesson that desperately tries to pass off several obvious logical errors as reality would have been better left out because neither is anywhere near believable enough to end up enhancing anything, but instead drags down what little immersion is already present.The voice acting and sound in general are great at least, so it\'s not all bad really. The art and animation are crippled by the stupid looks of almost every character but otherwise fairly good, must have been a difficult job. few strong points can be found.

Interviews with Monster Girls, I was really wondering what this anime would bring to the table, at first I thought it was going to be pretty boring, yet by the end I actually enjoyed it.Story (8/10)The story is set in a world where normal humans don't exist, instead evolution has produced many different types of supernatural humans who all have an equal life, we focus on Himeno, a centaur girl along her friends as they live out their school life.Now the story focuses a lot on the Slice of life genre, we see Himeno, Nozomi and Kyouko doing...normal things, like going to school or talking about personal questions so if you're looking for something incredibly interesting to happen then you're in the wrong place, however despite showing the main characters daily lives there's always a hidden message in most of the episodes, because despite all of the races having equal rights, everyone's freedom is somewhat limited, like for example any harsh comments on someone from a different race will have the commenter being taken away somewhere, so this world isn't the paradise it seems to be.The show really goes into depth with this subject, it even has it's own version of the Holocaust which makes us learn why equality is something we shouldn't take for granted, the same can be said in the same episode as one member of the amphibian folk has become very popular helping the world while the other members of his race wish to attack the other races, because they don't have the luxury the other races have.The show can also be very knowledgeable especially during the final episodes, where some of the kid characters are learning the names of different flowers and why they aren't just called flowers, this episode felt like it focused on individuality which is something each of the characters have too.Yet with all the knowledge this show has to offer, I liked how the final episode was there for fun really as we see the main characters in a fantasy setting and having an arm wrestling competition with the other classmates, so if there isn't a season 2 I'd actually be fine with what this show offered.Characters (8/10)The characters were definitely interesting as each stood out, not just with their physical appearance, but also with their personalities and characteristics.Himeno, Nozomi and Kyouko are the main characters of the show, Himeno who is a centaur, is the cute, clumsy, innocent girl of the group and as a female character in this category she is very likeable, her compassionate nature towards her friends and her cousin Shino sometimes make her look like a mother or older sister figure, but her sweet personality will always make her seem like a big child.Nozomi is the tomboy girl of the group, she tends to be quite lazy sometimes especially when it comes to her studies, but she does like to have a good joke with her friends from time to time, however she does care for them greatly and is willing to stick up for them whenever they get in trouble.Kyouko is definitely the most intelligent member of the group, despite lacking in the athletic department, she can be quite assertive sometimes like when she was helping Nozomi with her maths, or with her father when he was writing a novel, she can also be pretty funny often making jokes even when their not supposed to be jokes and always see's the stupid side in some situations.Manami Mitama is the class president and motherly figure for her family, she can be very bossy, but that's in order to make her younger sisters stop messing around, she is also a very caring person since she knows how active her younger sisters are, she makes sure they are safe wherever they go.Sassassul or Sue for short is the only Antarctican in the show who is a major character, despite having the head of a giant snake, she is a surprisingly interesting and yet adorable character, mainly because she is learning about the way humans live compared to her own kind, she does provide a fun source of entertainment since she is the odd one out amongst the group so her actions with other characters end up them having funny conversations.Art (8/10)The art was definitely interesting, especially considering there are no normal humans in this show at all, there are either centaurs, angels, demons, cat people, merfolk, Antarcticans or even amphibian folk, so the diversity of different types was a fun sight to see, especially the Antarcticans who may seem terrifying at first, but considering how Sue's character was they seem like nice people.I also liked how well detailed some objects were in this show, like for example the flowers in episode 11 were definitely something nice to look at and it also interested me how there were normal devices we usually see that have been adapted for the other races too.I think the one problem I had with the art style was the censoring of some scenes, I mean I've seen better ways of censoring breasts than a long strobe of light.Sound (8/10)The op was another big surprise for me, I wasn't expecting it to be really catchy yet somewhat badass at the same time, I thought it was going to be generic, but that wasn't the case here, same for the ed too which had a soft tone to it that felt relaxing to hear at the end of each episode.I thought the soundtrack was good, I think the part that stood out the most was the merfolk episode where we saw them doing their ritual to their God.Extras:I thought the comedy was actually pretty funny, especially when it came to the more embarrassing subjects, but that isn't the whole case since those type of episodes were taken care of pretty early on, I also thought Manami's sisters were pretty funny too with their constant schemes of entertaining themselves alongside Nozomi's teasing towards Himeno in some of the episodes.Enjoyment (8/10)Overall (8/10)Overall this was a pretty entertaining show, especially when it came to the amount of knowledge it offered and some of the more ethical issues it had in the background, alongside some pretty enjoyable characters, this is definitely a surprise I wasn't expecting. normal things, like going to school

alongside Nozomi's teasing towards Himeno in some of the episodes.Enjoyment (8/10)Overall (8/10)Overall this was a pretty entertaining show, especially when it came to the amount of knowledge it offered and some of the more ethical issues it had in the background, alongside some pretty enjoyable characters, this is definitely a surprise I wasn't expecting."", ""Centaur no Nayami, otherwise known as Centaur's Worries, is a Slice of Life episodic series that follows the everyday activities of Kimihara Himeno and her classmates, exploring topics we deal with on a day-to-day basis such as sexuality, racism, and taking care of a family. These topics are shrouded by a moe art style, allowing viewers to take in a message along with the classic animation they desire.Story: 6/10Centaur's Worries takes place in an alternate universe where humans have been some hybrid of supernatural beings such as angels, demons, satyrs, mermaids, and of course, centaurs. Centaur's Worries doesn't have much of a story to follow...since it is an episodic series. There are references to past episodes as you follow along, however. Anyways, each episode is split into a Part A and Part B with their own unique stories. Judging each individual story and averaging out the performances, it comes out as a solid 6. The stories are cute and fun to follow along, but more often than not, the characters will drag on with the same topic for a bit longer than what's necessary, ruining the pacing and execution.Art: 7/10Centaur's Worries is full of monster-hybrid humans, therefore, you expect to see such diversity like what was seen in Monster Musume, right? Unfortunately, there is very little variation within each character's design. Most of the variation was given to the female cast, as each one looks very colorful and lively compared to their male counterparts. Even with a lack of variation in design, an effort was definitely put into each main character's design. It's clear to tell who's who in Centaur's Worries without giving each character bright neon hair as seen in many other shows. The backgrounds are fitting, nothing too special.Sound: 7/10The opening theme is very out of place compared to the rest of the show, as it's very energetic. An odd choice for a Slice of Life, but I still found myself listening each time instead of skipping. However, the sound effects and background used throughout Centaur's Worries are very outdated. Chances are, you've heard it all from a different show. This isn't saying they're bad, rather, I believe audiences would've preferred something fresh.Character: 7/10Every character is a walking cliche. You have the big-chested klutz, the strong tomboy, the silent insight, the responsible class president, so on and so forth. Even if these characters are cliched and have been seen several times throughout anime, they still felt like they had their own individual personalities. I didn't feel like I was listening to Character A and Character B, instead, I knew I was listening to Himeno and Nozomi.Enjoyment: 7/10Some episodes I found myself dosing off or chatting on Discord, but the majority of them were pretty enjoyable to follow along. Side note, there is a lot of mentions towards breasts in this show. Of course, it isn't a bad thing in anime, but this show has at least one or two references towards a characters tits per episode, especially Himeno. Along with this, there is fan service, but it isn't over-the-top, thank God.Overall: 7/10If you're looking for something to pass the time full of cute characters and light fan service, Centaur's Worries has got you covered. I was surprised by the somewhat low ratings this show had received, as it is actually far more enjoyable than what other's say.

I went in expecting just another monstergirl-anime but got a strangely fanserviced social commentary-anime. This show would have, in my opinion, been great if they\'d just left the useless fanservice out. There are a lot of great things about this show such as talking about racism and the clashing of cultures, as well as the group psychology of humans and how they tend to form ingroups and outgroups. It also has a nice artstyle and interesting character designs. Some characters are personalitywise more excisting then others though.However I still...couldn\'t give this show a high rating because it just felt wrong. The oddest scene in this show by far is when three of the main girls talk about what their vaginas look like and then they proceed to look at each others vaginas to make sure that they are ""beautiful"" and ""normal"". I believe it is healthy for young girls to talk about their bodies and insecurities with their friends, don\'t get me wrong, but the way this scene is made is just for fanservice purposes and it feels very disrespectful to the characters and to the message the show is trying to tell.story: 5(there wasn\'t really a plot since it\'s slice of life but episode plots were ok)art: 7(pretty normal, some scenes animated well, others not so much)characters and development: 5(The only character I liked or cared about was Mitama Manami and yet she didn\'t get enough screentime)soundtrack: 5(nothing amazing, nothing awful)opening and ending: 7(catchy songs but op doesn\'t really tell anything about the show except that people won\'t watch anime without luring them in with fanservice... ending was good)my personal enjoyment: 6(It might have been a 9 if not for all the fanservice)final grade: 6 couldn\'t give this show a high rating because it just felt wrong.

The unfortunate turn here is that within the first 10 minutes the established cannon goes into detail about how slavery is an engrained part of their history and how there...are ultra sensitive anti discrimination laws in place that are HEAVILY enforced to the effect of having to be taken away from your home and sent to a rehabilitation camp for violations. This is not a one-off inclusion of their history, but rather a MAJOR plot point in EVERY episode. The hyper-specific depictions of how races were enslaved and why, and the political TV arguments of why merfolk do or don\'t deserve prosthetics all pervade the advertised happy feeling of a typical SoL show about a group of friends figuring out their differences like most SoL\'s set in high school. The moments where they\'re just teens figuring out life are cute! But the moments where one or more of the characters is outspokenly anxious about being sent to a anti-discriminatory rehab camp are all but few and far between. It genuinely is upsetting looking into this. I am not someone who believes that our IRL world is free of bigotry and hatred, but the fact that someone would write about and later a TEAM would write into a show about in depth fantasy racism and ableism is just so fucked.

I cannot emphasize how much I wanted to like this show and was just routinely left feeling upset or viscerally disgusted with the images or notions provided by this show. are ultra sensitive anti discrimination laws in place that are HEAVILY enforced to the effect of having to be taken away from your home and sent to a rehabilitation camp for violations.

It did bring more slice of life (and a bit of humor) to the table more than anything else, but I totally don't mind that since I'm a fan of it. But if you don't like slice of life, or if you expected/wanted something entirely else from Centaur no Nayami then I can understand it might not be your thing.Anyway, the slice of life that is there is pretty entertaining. Not absolutely great or incredibly noteworthy, but definitely fun at the very least. For me, it didn't feel like a chore to...sit through at all: it gave me a few laughs and interesting concepts to keep myself busy with. The quality of the art and the sound was decent as well.The biggest drawback to Centaur no Nayami, at least in my opinion, is that it feels like so many potential subjects, storylines and character developments were wasted. Centaur no Nayami introduces your typical world filled with animal-/monster-human hybrids. The world seems much more like that of 'Demi-chan wa Kataritai' than most others. But where it kinda disappoints me is that Centaur no Nayami introduces a whole lot, but then does nothing with it later on. An example is that there's a storyline of racism, which they always hint at, but apart from one episode delving a little deeper into it, we get nothing else. Another example are the snake people, always explained as 'mysterious' and 'secretive'... They even start something in 1 episode which I won't spoil. But despite there being a snake girl character introduced into the school that the protagonists attend - Sassassul Quetzalcoatl - they don't explore these concepts much further at all. Which is a shame, since I really liked that character and even the snake people in general.It comes down to this with me: They should have either A) focused on the slice of life and humor parts full-on and not tease us with all kinds of concepts they won't delve into, or B) they should have just explored the things they introduced much further.Overall, it really is a pretty fun watch, if only just for the slice of life elements and a bit of the humor... But it could have been so much more, especially with all the concepts we get teased with. It gets a 7 from me, certainly pretty enjoyable to watch, but also leaving much to be desired afterwards. sit through at all: it gave me a few laughs and interesting concepts to keep myself busy with.

I did not read spoilers and chose it based solely on the picture...a Centaur MC was something I have never seen before.The first thing that strike me as odd was the amount of Yuri baiting there was in this series. Almost everyone can be paired up with another girl but there is no clear cut answer except for one couple.I started this series because of the Centaur girl but by episode 2 I was already fed up with...her character, it only got worst as the series progress as almost every other character, including one off characters were more interesting than our MC.Half way through her role diminishes and focus is placed on other characters, I must say I was more attracted to Class President and her family drama then MC's perfect life.There was also the added WTF episodes where random back stories were given to character's that we were just introduced to and will literally only last as long as it takes for us to go through their backstory. Though this gave the series more 'food for thought' it was none the less wasted storytelling time as it did nothing to advance the already non existent plot line. There is also a sinister underlining social issue that gets subtly mentioned but is never forefront or acknowledge so again it was unnecessary.In the end, what we have is a series that's too dark to be a Slice of Life and too light to be a Drama with an MC that is too Vanilla to keep attention.Literally the only thing that makes MC stand out is her big breast that gets a lot of mentions and screen time. She was also supposed to be very Moe but considering there is a tiny half angel half cat little girl named Sue-chan there was no way she could sell on Moe alone. her character, it only got worst as the series progress as almost every other character, including one off characters were more interesting than our MC.Half way through her role diminishes and focus is placed on other characters, I must say I was more attracted to Class President and her family drama then MC's perfect life.There was also the added WTF episodes where random back stories were given to character's that we were just introduced to and will literally only last as long as it takes for us to go through their backstory.

I read the synopsis and looked at the cover and thought the show was going to be a bland CGDCT anime but I couldn't have been more wrong.The story while having no real sense of progression, did manage to explore a myriad of topics in a way that allowed the show to have additional layers. It almost feels like the show gets philosophical even as we watched Himeno and the cast of characters go through their mundane activities.The art and animation were standard and the same could be said of the soundtrack....The characters were entertaining enough and I thought in particular that the interactions between the characters were done well.To conclude, Centaur no Nayami was more enjoyable than it initially lets on and for a Slice of Life anime, the story had a sense of realism to it. The show isn't going to be winning any awards or anything but it was at the very least easy to get through and it's one that can get the recommendation from me.

The show's focus on racism and discrimination was a refreshing take on the anime genre, as I haven't seen this topic brought up before. Additionally, the opening and closing songs of Centaur no Nayami were great. On the other hand, the story felt disjointed and lacked a coherent narrative thread. While I understand that the Slice of Life genre doesn't necessarily require a significant plot or lack thereof, it still felt a bit empty and it was mostly just full of...fan service and sexual assault.Overall, if you're looking for an anime with a meaningful and immersive storyline, this particular anime may not be the best option. However, if you're in the mood for a lighthearted and enjoyable anime with lovable characters and great artistry, then it may be worth a watch. fan service and sexual assault.Overall, if you're looking for an anime with a meaningful and immersive storyline, this particular anime may not be the best option.

I find this show so intriguing yet the less than average score MAL users have decided to give this show baffles me. So I am here to state my reasoning as to why I think Centaur no Nayami is not only a good show, but an interesting one at that!(Note: At this point in time there have been 6 episodes released so I think it is fair to judge this show at it\'s halfway point.)Story: 7/10The story is a very simple one. It\'s your typical cute girls doing cute things...show but with a twist. In this world, humans are nothing but a myth and everyone is part monster, such as part-centaur, part-bat, or part-goat. Throughout the episodes you get a deeper look at the society they live in, such as how there are different types of discrimination that can occur or how certain types of races are considered to be the founders of society and thus has spread rumors and myths about their culture. I find this interesting as it gives us a world separate from ours but just close enough to ours where we can still relate to certain situations that unfold throughout the story.Art: 7/10There isn\'t that much to say about Art. The studio behind this is Haoliners Animation League, who, unlike most of their other works, has a mostly Japanese cast behind this show. The character designs are fine and so are the backgrounds. A standard anime look if you ask me. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing outstanding about it.Sound: 7/10The OST in this show has the basic types of songs you would hear in any other slice of life show. The OP and ED are pretty good though, especially the ED. Otherwise, not much else to say here, standard stuff really.Character: 7/10Most of the characters are basic, but in a good way. You have the main character, Himeno, who is the Gentle girl. Kyouko, who is that one character who always has her eyes closed and is friends with Hime and Nozomi, who is the tomboy. The classmates aren\'t really anything special either, except for the Student Council President, Manami, who actually does appear more often than the other classmates. Another girl worth mentioning is Sassassul, who is a Snake Person who has transferred into Hime\'s school. Snake People have had an interesting past according to others and it is really interesting to see the development she has with the other classmates and how she is viewed by the public.Enjoyment: 8/10I am not one to go out of my way to watch Slice of Life show\'s often but I found myself really enjoying the slow pace this show has and the dynamic between the characters. It\'s nice to watch on a lazy Sunday.Overall: 7/10I advise you the check this show out, regardless of the low score it has at this moment. The society that is shown throughout the show is interesting enough to keep me coming back to this show week after week. The characters are also something that can grasp you into the show. I hope that this first half of the show continues to improve and end up being more recognized as time goes on so that more people are able to appreciate this show and the concepts it brings to the table other than just being ""another monster girl show"". show but with a twist.

There were things I liked, as well as disliked when it came to this anime. As for the likes, I think the characters were extremely adorable and the art was great. I judge anime on art a lot of the times, and if the art doesn't look good, I won't attempt watching it most of the time. (I understand I miss out on some good anime doing this, I'm trying to get myself out of this habit.) I also liked the opening and ending songs. I found myself listening to them even after I'd already finished the anime, so that's...a plus. As for the things I disliked, it was really only one thing, but one of the most important things; the story. I didn't like how it was all over the place, not really carrying on a story at all honestly. It felt like a whole series that was completely filled with filler episodes. Don't get me wrong, I'd watch it if you're in the mood for something light-hearted and cheerful, but if you're looking to follow a good story, get invested to it, I'd look somewhere else. a plus.

In other words, BORING.I realised this anime was based on manga, so I can't say for sure...the whole anime is shit since I haven't read the manga.

The only thing that really caught my attention was that part that was about WW2. Everything else put me to sleep. You don't really adore any of the characters because they're all very generic, the story has no real plot or conflict. I get that maybe it's kind of a slice of life anime (and I love slice of life animes btw), but this one was just awful.

The style was appealing and the animation wasn't bad except when it came to other four legged animals that weren't the main character.

I just can't imagine why they chose the last episode for that. What a weird way to end!The story was a very pleasent surprise as well. Evolution is diferente from what we know. Snakes, frogs, cats were the winners of the gennetic lottery on their world. This scenery is used for social criticism.

It feels almost as if it was written as a regular slice-of-life series, but an editor came in and said: ""Monster girls are popular, so make them monster girls."" Then they wrote a very complex and wholesome story about the struggles that come with living in a society with such varied species. Then the editor came back and said: ""This is too complex and real, make them do lewd stuff.""If you boil them down to the very basics, Centaur no Nayami and Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou have...very similar components.

""What if humans adopted a different form of evolution, with different animals as the starting form? Fish people? Bird people and even centaurs? And these would live in a slightly sociocritical situation, just like us. The basic idea would be interesting, wouldn\'t it?""No matter how I look at it, the concept would have been suitable in itself. Likewise, the...intro also relatively aroused my curiosity. But what did the viewer get?A not even average comedy, with some of the most boring slice of life episodes you can imagine. On top of that, the author probably didn\'t even have an idea of what he wanted to make of it. So we had plenty of fan service, plenty of sexual references, a vagina comparison between the girls (yes, word literally) and a collection of the worst conversations imaginable.I\'ve seen a lot of slice of life anime, and I can understand why it\'s hard to be convincing in this genre. However, anyone who produces such uncreative grit where they have no idea what they are trying to do and instead explain to the viewer basics of humans or the different types and names of grass, this is the end. Not to mention episode 12, which also had word-for-word admission that it had no point. Ironically, episode 12 was the best in this anime.[Characters 3]We have the relatively typical shy centaur protagonist, with no real character traits. But she was worried about her vagina, so at least she has more personality than the others.Then we have the bat girl and some other girl whose name I didn\'t even remember because they didn\'t really have screentime or character.The snake girl was of course the best in terms of personality, but could hardly make up for the already non-existent quality.The majority of the characters\' scenes were kept within the concept of their everyday lives. How they dress, shower their little everyday problems and sexual topics. I\'m a bit irritated why the 3 cat drillings had such an ambiguous mindset. From whom, the sister or the father? They only go to kindergarten.[Animation 3]Until episode 4 it was still relatively average, but from then on I can\'t say anything other than - ""I probably have a higher budget than this studio""- seriously, neither the dishes, nor the proportions in the eyes they managed as soon as there were 2 or more characters in a scene.The intro and outro probably ate 90% of the budget.[Music 4] The intro was average, although the beginning sounded relatively individual. The outro was interesting, but immensely contextless. It gave the impression that there was more to the anime than there actually was.And the ost... for God\'s sake who signed off on that? They threw the osts in anywhere they wanted, the main thing being that the music could compensate for something. And then the osts were usually louder and more annoying than the scenes themselves.

There is no plot for the entire show, just random spurts of information and lore that nobody could really care for. There were some parts where it was humorous, but then there were parts where the show was humorous because of how horrible it was. It\'s impossible to relate or care for the characters, or in general, understand the concept of this show. Not even the fan service made it interesting, and that must say something. Personally, it missed the mark by a long shot and...I cannot recommend this anime to anyone. I would only make my friend Mulberry watch this to torture him. This anime is torture. I will find whoever made this anime and ask for my time back.“Talking to Highschool Girls Isn’t Really My Specialty” - The Dad1/10.The show ended with an arm wrestle, then the main character simply asked ""Why are we arm wrestling"" I cannot recommend this anime to anyone.

However, the tone of the show shifts several times when it starts to dive into slavery, racism and even almost an entire episode dedicated to a random politician neither seen nor referenced prior(afaik) and their experience in a concentration camp.

Everything together, the monster girl's lives and the larger political background; all that stuff just kind of bogs down things and ultimately nothing seems to come of any of it.I've giving it a 6 because I liked the general premise and the characters, and the way they interact with the world, but the larger world-building is too dense, unfocused and unconnected to the main characters. the show to me are when it focuses on the Centaur and her schoolmates and how they lead their lives and the various hardships they may face because of their different animal cultures and physiques.I'm not sure what the point of the show is, ultimately.

If you are a huge fan, please stop reading because I\'m about to rip this anime to shreds.Story: 3/10Character: 1/10Enjoyment: 2/10I\'ll group these 3 together just because they\'re all intertwined. I have no idea how this show was allowed to be made. I\'m genuinely confused. It starts out alright with us meeting the main characters. I was intrigued since I\'m a sucker for shows in which the main characters adventure together through different lands while meeting interesting characters along the way. The show is definitely this type of anime but it had major flaws that made me unable to appreciate any of that.The main issue is the lack of character development. The only way the premise of a group of characters traveling together works if you actually like the characters. Not only did I not like them, I didn\'t know anything about them. After the first few episodes, I expected us to see subtle characteristics that reflect their personalities and outlook on life. The show was more concerned with making Philly look as ""cool"" as possible rather than actually showing us how he came to have this unfazed, unenthusiastic attitude as well as the effect his loneliness has on him. They really gave us 5 seconds of his backstory in episode 11 and expected us to feel anything for the guy.They also made him so overpowered that there were absolutely no stakes in every fight he was in. It\'s not a good sign when your viewer is hoping that the main character gets actually killed or heavily injured.The 2 bots were purposely written as naive idiots just so the writers can dump exposition on the viewer with the pretense of Philly having to explain every detail of the world they themselves live in. This is cheap and makes me feel like the writers just didn\'t give enough of a f*** to ingrain details in the scenes for the viewer to pick up on themselves. Other than the 5 minutes in ep8 that I felt pity for Casey and the first few episodes where we learn about Sam\'s relationship with the Prince, I didn\'t actually care for any of the characters in this show.This is sad because instead of doing this episodic bulls***, they could have spent time diving deep into these characters to reveal what makes them tick, what motivates them, what makes them themselves. But the writer decided that it was more vital to the story to show how cooky and zany the different towns of the universe are. I DONT CAAAARRREEEE! Give me heart, give me passion, give me something to make me want to root for these characters instead of spending nearly 6 hours of my life watching the most hollow characters do absolutely nothing and finally being thrown into a battle. They should have been building up to the final fight, instilling anticipation in the viewer with each episode. Instead, we had no idea how far away they were from their destination and had no actual confirmation that Philly was indeed taking them there. Because I still can\'t come up with any legitimate reason why he would. He could have just roamed around and gone where he wanted to go while lying to his companions so as to keep Casey with him as his handyman. I fact, taking them where they wanted to go would only lead to Casey leaving with Sam and Philly being left without a handyman. There is more reason for him to keep them away from their destination! THIS IS SIMMMMMMPLLLEEE TO FIGGGGURRREE OUUUT! The people ivolved in this show could have taken 1 second to flesh out this part and made this show make sense. But no! They have cool transformer cars. They don\'t need decent writing!And to top it all off, they came back to spit in my face with the sh**show that was the last 2 episodes. I genuinely feel disrespected. The writers gave absolutely no f***s and decided they\'d throw all reason out the window. Because of the lack of character development, the viewer was forced to assume each character\'s motivations for doing what they were doing. But the writers wanted to ""surprise"" us, so they wrote the final 2 episodes in which none of the things the characters did made any sense and you were forced to watch the most chaotic fight scenes, not knowing who was on who\'s side. I truly felt like I had missed an entire season of content between episode 10 and 11 because the random s*** that was happening had no rhyme or reason.I think this is it for me. I don\'t know if accurately describe how much of a waste of time this show was. I can\'t understand how anyone could come out of this wanting a second season. The entire show was clearly a setup for the next season, but I genuinely hope it doesn\'t happen for the sake of my sanity.I know this review was pretty dramatic but I just want to say that if you did enjoy it, good for you. We all have different tastes, but this was just my take on this show. it well.

The show is definitely this type of anime but it had major flaws that made me unable to appreciate any of that.The main issue is the lack of character development. The only way the premise of a group of characters traveling together works if you actually like the characters. Not only did I not like them, I didn\'t know anything about them. After the first few episodes, I expected us to see subtle characteristics that reflect their personalities and outlook on life. The show was more concerned with making Philly look as ""cool"" as possible rather than actually showing us how he came to have this unfazed, unenthusiastic attitude as well as the effect his loneliness has on him. They really gave us 5 seconds of his backstory in episode 11 and expected us to feel anything for the guy.They also made him so overpowered that there were absolutely no stakes in every fight he was in. It\'s not a good sign when your viewer is hoping that the main character gets actually killed or heavily injured.The 2 bots were purposely written as naive idiots just so the writers can dump exposition on the viewer with the pretense of Philly having to explain every detail of the world they themselves live in. This is cheap and makes me feel like the writers just didn\'t give enough of a f*** to ingrain details in the scenes for the viewer to pick up on themselves. Other than the 5 minutes in ep8 that I felt pity for Casey and the first few episodes where we learn about Sam\'s relationship with the Prince, I didn\'t actually care for any of the characters in this show.This is sad because instead of doing this episodic bulls***, they could have spent time diving deep into these characters to reveal what makes them tick, what motivates them, what makes them themselves. But the writer decided that it was more vital to the story to show how cooky and zany the different towns of the universe are. I DONT CAAAARRREEEE! Give me heart, give me passion, give me something to make me want to root for these characters instead of spending nearly 6 hours of my life watching the most hollow characters do absolutely nothing and finally being thrown into a battle. They should have been building up to the final fight, instilling anticipation in the viewer with each episode. Instead, we had no idea how far away they were from their destination and had no actual confirmation that Philly was indeed taking them there. Because I still can\'t come up with any legitimate reason why he would. He could have just roamed around and gone where he wanted to go while lying to his companions so as to keep Casey with him as his handyman. I fact, taking them where they wanted to go would only lead to Casey leaving with Sam and Philly being left without a handyman. There is more reason for him to keep them away from their destination! THIS IS SIMMMMMMPLLLEEE TO FIGGGGURRREE OUUUT! The people ivolved in this show could have taken 1 second to flesh out this part and made this show make sense. But no! They have cool transformer cars. They don\'t need decent writing!And to top it all off, they came back to spit in my face with the sh**show that was the last 2 episodes. I genuinely feel disrespected. The writers gave absolutely no f***s and decided they\'d throw all reason out the window. Because of the lack of character development, the viewer was forced to assume each character\'s motivations for doing what they were doing. But the writers wanted to ""surprise"" us, so they wrote the final 2 episodes in which none of the things the characters did made any sense and you were forced to watch the most chaotic fight scenes, not knowing who was on who\'s side. I truly felt like I had missed an entire season of content between episode 10 and 11 because the random s*** that was happening had no rhyme or reason.I think this is it for me. I don\'t know if accurately describe how much of a waste of time this show was. I can\'t understand how anyone could come out of this wanting a second season. The entire show was clearly a setup for the next season, but I genuinely hope it doesn\'t happen for the sake of my sanity.I know this review was pretty dramatic but I just want to say that if you did enjoy it, good for you. We all have different tastes, but this was just my take on this show.', 'Story: I thought this was pretty average, nothing special but enough too intrigue me to keep watching. That powers are cool and the world itself is actually pretty interesting. Some of the humor is gold, while other times your left thinking ""huh?"" Honestly the story is probably the weakest link for me, the show is held together by the cast of characters, world building, and animation. There are some episodes that don\'t really handle the main plot, but rather side stories, and I was much more intrigued by them.Art: Most the fight scenes are actually pretty good. The world design is really unique and you...can tell the artists put a lot of time in the background shots with lots of interesting items and details. The art style reminds me of gurran-lagann mixed with old school 90\'s anime.Sound: I really enjoyed the sound track. The OST and EST are really good. Most sound effects are great, nothing to complain about.Characters: Good and bad, the bad guy is probably the most generic anime bad guy you can come up with. Luckily the main cast is interesting enough to hold the show together. The back story for each character is good, but short. Hopefully next season will flavor the villain with a more interesting plot.This show is a great one day binge for when you have nothing to do. It has plenty of interesting things to offer, overall I rate it at about an 8.  If it had just a little more to offer I would rate it higher, but for me the it is overall pretty generic and just stands out in a few artist aspects. can tell the artists put a lot of time in the background shots with lots of interesting items and details.

For this particular Anime it is a good idea not to jump to conclusions based on the first few minutes of airing. Second, whether this particular Anime is for the viewer depends on their tastes. This Anime is more likely to appeal to viewers of the following demographics.One such demographic are viewers who enjoyed Trigun, Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Beepop and Rage of Bahamut. In fact, I suspect the American who created the source material was highly influenced by those works, yet he also pulled in a lot of Japanese cultural references such as the forty-seven...ronin and Kamen Rider – meaning those who like looking for references to such things is another demographic this series hits up.Of the demographics the series isn’t likely to appeal to include those who won’t like the fact the original source material is Western, yet this is still an Anime as the original audio and not just the animation was done in Japan. I think one of the things I like regarding Cannon Busters was in fact noticing the influences of Trigun, Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Beepop, yet the creator of the source material wasn’t influenced by that alone and actually knows quite a bit about Japanese culture.Second, the series isn’t likely to appeal to those who hate unscrupulous rouges as one of the main protagonists, let alone characters who are majorly naïve as the two robot companions are. Even the prince for whom the one bot is searching for can come across as bratty. However, the characters do develop and each of the things I listed can be considered fatal flaws characters need to overcome. Another aspect I liked was how the characters did grow.If I were to pick though, one thing I didn’t like so much regarding the characters, it would be the villains. Each of the true villains except for the big main felt honestly flat compared to the other canon characters, yet part of this comes from the fact their motives aren’t ever revealed to the cast beyond the main villain. In fact, there is a level of mystery regarding Botica that slowly unravels as the season progresses yet isn’t completely revealed as the audience is left at a cliffhanger.The third demographic the series isn’t likely to appeal to are those who don’t enjoy the type of humor in the series which falls into the Dark Comedy genre. One of the reasons viewers need give more than a few minutes to watch the first episode comes down to the fact the humor may appear childish yet starts becoming more macabre as the season progressed. Some of the ways Philly ends up dying are quite gruesome yet fall into the horror genre. In fact, the series manages to blend quite a few genre into the series.As for any issues beyond whether the series will appeal to a specific demographic, I didn’t find much fault beyond the one-dimensional feeling of the villains and the fact the viewer is left at a cliff hanger.

Each character has a unique design that, just by looking at them, will tell you their personality traits and backstory.The opening and ending of this anime is one of those kind that I never skip. In other words, the sound track is good.The world building cuts right to the case by showing you what the rules of the world are rather than telling you. However, this is a bit lacking when it comes to the story sensitive areas of the anime. Because of the diverse cast...and the different backgrounds, it feels like the scope is a tad bit too big to fit in 12 episodes and results with most characters feeling watered down.With this said I had fun watching the anime and look forward to the continuation.

The adventure with Billy is great, the plot of Botica is meh but The tone shift is really jarring and clash massively with everything else. Also the transitions are bad. Everytime it cuts back to Botica it doesn't feels organic and you can't distinguish the flahback from the part in current time...Also at first the botica story was done only when Sam slept, which meant it was her dreaming about it (Kasey said it too) but the POV wasn't hers. They showed you parts of the story she couldn't have...seen since she wasn't there... So how exactly is it still part of her dream, and you can't say it wasn't a part of it from the begining since everytime we cutted bat to it she was knocked out. The series even did 10 seconds cut to present events just to have her be knocked out again and get back to the Botica story.Also at the end they completely abandon that idea and just cutted to Botica without any warning. The clash of tones is so jarring that even the music shift from jazzy to sinister and it really doesn't fit. Even the present stuff starts not being great at some point... Episode 4 in a nutshell : Billy is stupid and even while being literaly 1 meter away from Nine can't understand that the guy is here to find informations and kill someone else, not him... Even though Nine screams it... Then we have that really forced team up at the end and for a pac of beer Nine comes along with them....

The anime begins by misleading viewers into thinking that this story is going to be a lighthearted one and the protagonist, Philly the Kid is just going to be another character that does everything because he has a good moral compass. Instead, we\'re shown that Philly is anything but that, he\'s a jerk motivated only by two things: alcohol and girls.It\'s what makes Philly and even most of the cast likable (though I couldn\'t find myself stomaching Prince Kelby, I\'m hoping future seasons will give him some character growth). They all don\'t fit into a stereotypical anime character mold; no one can be divided into a neat box labeled as ""good"" or ""evil."" Hell, even the kingdom of Botica was shown to be really messed up once the rose-tinted glasses were forcibly ripped off of the viewers once we got a taste of Philly\'s past via a flashback.A lot of the characters have their vices and flaws. While they can be annoying I felt that this series did a spectacular job getting me to love characters that were morally messed up. From 9ine, the drunk assassin, who was shown to have no qualms about killing kids in his past or even the antagonist himself who fought for his own messed up reasons.Not to mention that despite all of the bright colors that this anime paints itself with it can get really dark to the same level of Berserk and Devilman Crybaby. It doesn\'t shy away from the fact that in a lawless, dessert world people are willing to do whatever they need to do, even if it means killing a couple of people and skinning them to make clothes (if you know what episode I\'m talking about I didn\'t sleep for a while afterward).This anime just overall is something that I think everyone should give a chance. Even if you watch every single episode and finding yourself not liking anything, I think you\'ll at least enjoy the soundtrack. It\'s pretty rare for me to never skip an OP and I rarely ever listen to the ED, but with Cannon Busters I found myself listening to every single second of both because they both really captured the nature and overall tone of the show.

It's an incredibly interesting series built from a lot of disparate parts with references and ideas and concepts from all over the place and it's fun to pick them out and notice them. It also stands rather well on its own, albeit with a bit of difficulty due to the hesitance with which the series gives you unique information about the setting.The characters are great, lovable, they bounce off of each other well and they banter. The humor can be hit or miss but it was usually a hit...for me personally, so I'm gonna give it a thumbs up there. The one thing that could not be said negatively about this show is character designs. From Philly, to SAM, to side characters like Hilda, Manic, and Bridge, this series' designs are slick and unique and memorable even if the names aren't quite reinforced well. I had to google to find the main villain of the season's name and her henchmen are impossible to find the names of without digging.Action's incredibly solid, well animated with some amazing cuts in here, and great amounts of spacial consistency to keep you engaged in how the environment plays into every battle.Big stumbling block when it comes to story. The story of the first season is incredibly all over the place and it seems like it's just setting up elements for a later season without much care for the coherence of this season. If this series gets cancelled, it'll be a shame, because we don't get the full story for a lot of our characters.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible amount of black representation. Most background characters and main characters are black and noticeably so and it's amazing to see a series so densely populated. Most anime fans like usual probably don't care about representation because chances are they've been represented their entire lives and never ever have had to think about what it feels like to not be at the forefront of a story. But as a black person, it feels amazing. The series is incredibly lacking on queer characters. Sucks, but it's how it goes.Give Cannon Busters a shot. It's not amazing, but there's something in there for literally every kind of anime fan and it needs your support to continue and get better. for me personally, so I'm gonna give it a thumbs up there.

It creates a giant mess. While there are some interesting character designs, what really counts, characters and story, are poorly done, ruining whatever this show had to offer.To give you an idea of what I mean by all the tropes here's the synopsis: a couple of happy go lucky androids from a fantasy kingdom team up with an immortal outlaw who owns a giant Pink Cadillac that can transform into a giant Minotaur Robot. Their goal, to reach the prince that one of the androids was programmed to...the best friend of. Oh, and said android is one of those chosen one stereotypes. Add in a crazy team of assassins chasing them, and even a drunken master, and you get the point. The writer simply wanted to put ALL the things he liked about anime into one work.When the show is at it's best is when it just goes nuts. All these crazy characters could run around doing god only knows what, and it can work. This lends itself to a more episodic format, which I wish they could have committed to. Unfortunately, the story is only kind of episodic, with a very week through story woven within it. The tone is not consistent, being wacky one episode, and then dealing with darker themes the next. The entire prince arc is a drag. Just a total mess of a narrative that has a rather weak conclusion, most likely because I could care less about any of the characters.This show is going for over the top, I get it. That means damn near all the characters are going to be one note, hyper flat cliches. This works fine in something like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure because they do a good job of making the good guys awesome, and the bad guys dicks. Here, I didn't like a single character that we're supposed to be rooting for. Sam and Casey are very annoying, and Philly is a selfish prick. The prince is a spoiled brat. The rest of the cast are totally forgettable. The bad guys, well, they're pretty much just bad for the sake of being bad guys. The big bad has a little backstory, but a very cliche one. Buy the time it gets to the final battle, there are side fights between characters you really know very little about, and have zero investment into.Technically, this show was competently executed. The animation and sound are executed to the point where they didn't detract, nor elevate the show.

Just like countless other shows and comics, Cannon Busters (based on an American comic that started in 2005) is an anime that takes the familiar cliches and plot devices and transforms them all into something unique, using them less as features and more as actual tools for the story, art, sound, and characters.There was one moment that I knew I would love every episode of this 12-episode run: When...I heard the opening theme, ""Showdown"". Sung in English by Marty Grimes and BJRNCK, this song is a mix of hip-hop and funk that is a delight to the ears. I would encourage anyone who is not sure if they will watch Cannon Busters, to go watch the OP on YouTube first. On top of this, the show has a great cast, diverse in both character and artwork, an important thing for viewers who normally see nothing but the same characters every season. The animation and writing was supervised by the comic author, LeSean Thomas, and produced by a production team that included Tim Yoon, who worked on both Avatar: The Legend of Korra and Batman: Under the Red Hood. Taking place on the completely different world of Gearbolt, Cannon Busters features a rich story-line with centuries of history to experience, where magic and technology clash and can be used for good or evil.

The main Trio really is a riot to watch and if you just watched it for the episodic rambunctious Adventures there really wouldn't be a problem. they have good chemistry together. Philly although he is a clown a lot of the times when he has his badass moments they're really badass, Sam's slow and subtle journey of becoming more and more human while also being one of the most happy and kindest people in the world really brings the heartwarming aspect of the show, and Casey is what I would call the middle ground between the two as she's not too serious but she also isn't as naive and ditzy as Sam. And for the rest of the characters they're okay but there honestly isn't much to talk about the villains didn't have enough time to get flushed out. one of the characters named nine who's supposed to be sort of a part of the main group didn't actually end up joining them for real until later on in the series towards the end, and the characters for the subplot the prince his guardian and a prisoner they captured also didn't have enough time to actually get anything interesting from them it felt like connections were forged too fast and we didn't get to see how it developed enough.Art 9/10: the art in the show is fantastic I'm glad Netflix decided not to go with their common CGI. they need to do more stuff like this it had decent sakuga moments Vivid colors cool action scenes and awesome character designs.Sound design 9/10: how much to say hear the sound design is awesome the OST is great and Netflix is finally making real openings and endings now instead of just one or noneStory 7/10: the story is pretty good but it's like Mona Lisa missing her eyes and hands (no boners for Kira this time) there are certain things like villains introduced with powers that are only vaguely discussed history that sounds really interesting and cool that's only vaguely hinted at but has something to do with the main plot like magic. The main character has a certain aspect of his back store that's only briefly Shone through a few flashbacks and really could have been a good motivator and piece of his character if they decided to dive into it a little more and story hurts because of it. The way how the backstory of a lot of the events that are happening are revealed through really weird ways like the character will end up daydreaming about some important Exposition it just feels clunky and not as smooth as it could have been if they just gave it more time to have these things come up instead of trying to shove them awkwardly into an episode where other things are already happening. Other than that though it's a riot to watch it has an interesting world where the characters go around and help or cause havoc and it's fun for what it is in it 's contained episodes it's just not as smooth in the overarching plot as it could have been.Overall:8/10: honestly it reminds me of the anime of old where it was just like a fun watch straight through. If it had more time to be flashed out it would have been perfect but as long as there is a season two they can always correct that. Cool world to watch an Explorer with the characters and the characters are never boring on screen and they have a lot of interesting aspects about them. the villains are weak but that could also be corrected with just more backstory, and the action scenes are great. So really it's a great anime but it could be an excellent anime if they just would add the necessary parts to it.

I was surprised that Shinichiro Watanabe didn't even touch this show. Many things about this show take cues from few of the previously mentioned anime that he was involved with, from the characters, to the story, to the genre, to the art style (which was silly at some points), to even the music sounds like Cowboy Bebop's jazz soundtrack.

He's a bounty traveling with two girls which causes violence to follow them (Vash) and he has a cynical, sarcastic sense of humor (Spike) but unlike Spike, those traits make him more annoying than charming. Like, I think Spike had more sense than he did, Philly is just a butthole.Samberry A.K.A. Sam is friendly and naive to a fault, which can even get her in trouble. I don't mind her being a friendship type robot but she clearly has the guts to hurt people when they hurt her friends yet sometimes she doesn't take a hint when people treat her and her friends wrongly or appear to have hidden evil traits, she just thinks everything is a game.Casey is like Ed in her childlike, sweet, tech-savvy personality but somehow manages to be even more annoying than Ed. She's a Charmy Bee-sounding robot who's constantly blabbing her mouth about everything, she has no personality flaws, and has a stubborn obsession with anything technology.Sometimes I don't blame Philly, if I was around two dense robots, a Mary-sue who thinks that everyone is her friend and another who talks like a freaking 8 year old, while I'm trying to survive in a world that is so different from their naive minds, I would get annoyed too.Even the secondary characters are mediocre. Prince Kelby seemed like a nice guy with a sweet relationship with Sam who for some reason turned into a cold, jerkish guy and his relationship with Sam ended up being... I don't want to spoil it. And the worst character of them all, 9ine (probably a reference to the singer) is your typical amoral, rude anime character who drinks to an unhealthy amount.There's rarely any memorable songs in there. The only song that's catchy is Showdown, which is definitely the most memorable song out of the whole show. And the ending theme, Regardless, while not as memorable still sounds good.I don't think this anime is as awful as some people make it out to be as there are several good things about it. It has some funny parts, even a few witty dialogue moments and the beginning and ending were interesting. The way the show sets up the characters were interesting, we have a friendship robot, an outdated robot who wants to be upgraded, and an immortal who has tattoos of the amount of times he dies. And the last two episodes had more tension and even character stakes which is unfortunately rare in this series as the characters are quite two-dimensional. I didn't expect it to be renewed due to mixed reviews but here's hoping that the second season will have as good of a story as the last few episodes or else I'm skipping it. It's disappointing that this was written and directed by the guy that co-directed The Boondocks and I was happy to see an anime with a predominantly black cast.Cannon Busters gets a 4.8 out of 10.

Featuring mostly POC! It's really nice to see, would love to see more of this through all animes. Watched on netflix between different shows and was enjoyed. Rest of reviews are spot on, but I wanted to support black creators and it wasn't bad enough for me to drop. Sam is my favourite. Action and CGI mix is well done, and OP//ED are great. Sadly for having a cool bull mech transformer car it sure doesn't do much the whole length of the anime though :( "", ""It was a pretty average story, but the character design is pretty neat, and there's a lot of representation of minorities (poc, strong women, amputees, vitiligo, etc), so it's refreshing to watch in that sense.Some situations are genuinely funny and the action scenes aren't all that bad. There's some interesting character development and I like the way the main characters' personalities clash together. And it has a few mechas throwin in there in case that's your thing, including a cool mecha fight as the grand finale. However, the last 2 episodes are a bit anticlimactic, as they make little to no sense and have way...too many plot twists.

But it is almost as if the writers said ""fuck it"" with the rest of the squad initially.Characters stay the same.

It\'s simply refreshing to see something so different. One of the strengths of anime as a medium is its variety. There is an amazing variety of characters, premise, themes, you name it. Yet often, despite stories set in fantastical worlds where the creators have the freedom to make up any characters they want, they can still be lacking in diversity. Quite frankly it can be tiring when an entire cast of characters are the...same race (white usually), or even the same body shape. So kudos to LeSean Thomas for putting out something different, and it never calls attention to itself either, its simply noteworthy for me as a veteran anime fan.Is Cannon Busters a classic? No. I gave it a 7. That just means I was sufficiently entertained, it\'s above average but not great. But I was very close to giving it an 8. It\'s close to greatness. What lets it down are the main villain who is painfully generic, and the main narrative does sometimes feel a bit aimless without much momentum. Then it rushes towards a climax (begging for a sequel) with some contrived writing, but the characters are so fun it keeps you engaged.However, the tone and structure of this show is no different than the ones that inspired it. Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Samurai Champloo, etc. Exactly like most of those shows, this one is mostly episodic, with a main plot running in the background. Critics who bemoan this show for being a ""shameless copy"" must have rubbish memories or are actually lying about being fans of shows like Cowboy Bebop.Philly is nothing remotely like Spike Spiegel. Philly is a terrible fighter, a terrible shot, he literally dies in every single episode because of how dumb he is. Unlike Spike, Philly is an unemployed immortal bum who is the target of bounties. Unlike Spike, Philly is an actual anti-hero. Spike, despite his curmudgeon attitude, is deep down a good guy from the beginning of Bebop. Philly is a piece of shit for the entirety of Cannon Busters, constantly trying to get away from his robotic companions, and that is what makes him compelling protagonist. You\'re not supposed to like him. He is an amusing contrast to the androids. His is a typical character arc, we are witnessing a damaged guy slowly give away inch by inch to the travelling companions around him until they become friends. In that respect, the show is more similar to Samurai Champloo than it is Bebop, but even then Cannon Busters has its own DNA.The main narrative involving Kingdoms, princes and political intrigue is actually the least interesting thing about the show for me, the comedic episodic stuff are the highlights, as are the adorable Casey and hilarious SAM. The English dub is brilliant too, highly recommended.If you\'re a fan of 90s/00s anime like those inspirations mentioned above, bounty hunter tropes, a \'badlands\' landscape, episodic shenanigans, a diverse cast, an amazing opening and ending credits music, then give this show a chance.

It looked like something Cowboy Bebop fans would enjoy. And enjoyed it, I did.Number of Episodes: 12 (about 20 minutes an episode)Plot: B- *An unlikely crew of travelers goes on wacky adventures together in the futuristic land of Gearbolt. We follow S.A.M. a friendship robot who is on a quest to find the lost heir to the kingdom. She is accompanied by Casey Turnbuckle, a repair robot, and a fugitive Philly the Kid who is immortal. Together they fight against all sorts of mechs, evil...entities, and encounter all sorts of wacky individuals all the while Locke, the evil sorcerer who has the kingdom of Botica under his rule sends assassins after them. At the same time, the King Bolger sent his most trusted soldier, Odin, to accompany his son Kelby who is on the run from Locke\'s forces. This is a fun show that you shouldn\'t take too seriously. But the plot is serious enough where you care about Prince Kelby and watch as the two robots learn more human customs and Philly learns how to become a friend.Visuals: C+ *I keep going back and forth on my rating of the show\'s visuals. I love the character designs, but some of the movements feel so artificial. Anytime they show the Bessie, the car, transforming or driving, or cannon\'s turning, the way that it ""glides across the screen"" really bugs my eyes. There\'s something unnatural about a lot of the movements within fight sequences and like the Mass Effect anime, the color can be very cloudy at times. It\'s not enough to ruin the show or anything, but I hope that it looks more natural when/if they make follow up seasons.Voice Acting: A- *There\'s always one voice in anime to ruin it isn\'t there? Outside of Casey, I love every other voice. With S.A.M. and Philly the Kid\'s being my favorites. And quite honestly, their voices are probably amongst my favorites from any anime. S.A.M.\'s voice is ridiculously cute and Philly\'s voice actor has amazing comedic timing. But it\'t not just the main characters, the entire ensemble voices is really talented... although I swear anime can never not make the sound of children laughing not be ear cancer.Film Score/Soundtrack: Undetermined for now. *The opening and closing titles are both fantastic. And I liked the music in the context of the show, but I won\'t give a rating until I can hear it.Characters: A+ *This show would not work if the characters weren\'t all so damn likable. S.A.M. and Casey\'s naivety mixed in with Philly\'s tantrums leads to a lot of hilarious bantering. But what makes it even funnier is that our two female robot companions have a hard time reading into Philly the Kid\'s tone and it leads to them taking Philly\'s often sarcastic outbursts literally. But besides our trio, Prince Kelby learning how to lead along his journey via Odin\'s guidance was a nice serious dynamic to the story and a lot of the bizarre characters we meet along the way lead to lots of laughs.Cringeworthy Anime Moments:  I will never understand anime culture\'s obsession with these ""cutesy"" characters with super high-pitched voices. (Radical Ed I\'m looking at you...) Casey is most likely going to be a fan-favorite, and all I can think is I wish her voice was a bit less typical anime cringe. But besides that, this show has some really good dark humor and lots of laughs. And Casey really grew on me.Titles:Opening Titles: A+ *J-pop + hip-hop is such a good combo. I fell in love with this funky beat upon my first... and 50th listens.Closing Titles: A+ *This tack is straight fire too. It reminds me of The WeekndFinal Verdict: 8/10 *I binged this in two days. Cannon Busters is ridiculously entertaining and has a lot of potential for future seasons. Even though the story-line does seem to be progressing forward, it is very episodic in nature which means that they can take our odd party of travelers on so many bizarre sorts of adventures.

But besides our trio, Prince Kelby learning how to lead along his journey via Odin\'s guidance was a nice serious dynamic to the story and a lot of the bizarre characters we meet along the way lead to lots of laughs.Cringeworthy Anime Moments:  I will never understand anime culture\'s obsession with these ""cutesy"" characters with super high-pitched voices. (Radical Ed I\'m looking at you...) Casey is most likely going to be a fan-favorite, and all I can think is I wish her voice was a bit less typical anime cringe. But besides that, this show has some really good dark humor and lots of laughs. And Casey really grew on me.Titles:Opening Titles: A+ *J-pop + hip-hop is such a good combo. I fell in love with this funky beat upon my first... and 50th listens.Closing Titles: A+ *This tack is straight fire too. It reminds me of The WeekndFinal Verdict: 8/10 *I binged this in two days. Cannon Busters is ridiculously entertaining and has a lot of potential for future seasons. Even though the story-line does seem to be progressing forward, it is very episodic in nature which means that they can take our odd party of travelers on so many bizarre sorts of adventures. So long as the main story gets a bit less generic, there is some potential for some heavy moments like Cowboy Bebop has.', 'So I went into this with an open mind not knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. Sure Philly did remind me of Spike from Cowboy Bebop but he was still different and fun to watch. Sam was nice and I love her devotion to the prince, thought it was cute. And do not get me started on how much I loved Casey. She was just such a delight. This wild world with all the insanity and magic just made things so much more interesting. The opening song and art was very good and I will probably make it my ringtone. And my...favorite piece of this show was all the diversity which we do not see enough of in anime.

It is true, but I think it's kind of an intentional tradeoff for the chapters having an ever engaging element of randomness.There is some consistency tho. All main characters are pure fun thanks to their ways of interacting between them. Sound is well mixed and the soundtrack has a modern internet feel that mashes right with the reimagined anime 90s aesthetic.If ya fancy a mecha western adventure this is a cannon blast.

A super-naive android girl that can turn into a shapeshifting death machine.

All this stuffed into a world full of cyberpunk augmented thugs, magical kingoms, futuristic floating cities, wild-west saloons, and on and on.

The pace is frantic, we get new characters, stories and flashbacks slapped in our faces at breakneck speed, but with little to no context.

Awful design awards go to the main villain, floating claw lady, Russia white hair woman, and vitiligo girl.SOUND 5/10Something about cowboys + robots + anime just screams Nujabees or J-Dilla type music. Something with soul and rhythm. None of that was here. I know that\'s something up to personal preference, but even so, the soundtrack was very...unmemorable and felt kinda quiet and lacking impact during intense scenes.  Not horrible, not amazing— but I guess that’s kinda worse in a way.WOLRD 3/10One of the worst things in this show, other than the story, is the world building. Nothing in this world feels coherent or logical. There are no established rules in this world, or a pecking order of sorts. We see royal castles, samurai, cowboys, robots, magic, furries, discount Zalem from Gunnm— all kinds of shit. In this regard, it feels like Space Dandy, the difference being it actually WORKS there, because they are hopping galaxies, dimensions, and planets— NOT driving across state borders.How does anything in Cannon Busters fit together? All of this is happening on one world. It would be nice to have a sense of scale, or progress, or some kind of hint as to how this world functions, but apparently Philly and crew can just fucking drive anywhere they want, because all these conflicting areas are right next to each-other, connected by simple roads.The world feels like random set pieces strewn together, with an emphasis on cowboys. It doesn\'t help that we never really see these different kinds of worlds overlap in some major way. Where were the cowboy knights, furry samurais, western themed castles? They are utilizing all of these themes, yet they never combine them to create new and interesting ideas. It’s just goes to waste.CHARACTERS/STORY 2/10I\'m a fan of cute, dumb, friendly robots, so I am giving Sam and Casey a slight pass. It still would have been nice to get more character development on them, as the only thing we know about either of them, is that it’s very easy to convince Casey to go commit Sudoku, and that Sam is the Prince’s protector.Everyone else however, not so much.

An anime adaptation being made from an American graphic novel is already pretty notable, but when the author of that source material is LeSean Thomas who worked on projects I loved like The Boondocks, Black Dynamite, and The Legend of Korra (okay maybe love is strong for Korra) I had high hopes for this...project.Cannon Busters has some good bits, but I found the show rather overwhelmed in its own mediocrity. Character designs were very solid in most places and goofy as hell in others. Philly the Kid, S.A.M., Casey Turnbuckle, 9ine and others all had pretty solid designs, but a few characters like Odin the royal bodyguard had the head the size of a softball on top of the Incredible Hulk’s body and that just looks goofy. Our main antagonist Locke just came off as strange and feeling out of place design-wise. He really felt like some generic villain from a different genre squatting on in on this show.The animation on this project looked pretty good in a lot of places, but the show was really bogged down in most action sequences with it’s jarring use of low-grade CG. Sora Yori and other shows get away with a bit of light CG but when the main action sequence on the foreground of your scene is clunky low frame count garbage it really leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

My advice however would be instead of sitting through 8 episodes of mediocrity for that payoff please just watch Space Dandy and get that sort of masterfully orchestrated narrative pretty much every episode.On the topic of Casey Turnbuckle, her character is an absolute delight and I love her even if she couldn’t save her show. Shiori added yet another cutesy character to her repertoire with Casey, but as with her performance with Nanachi in Made in Abyss, Izawa really stole the show. Hinaki Yano had her debut (from what I could find on MAL) with her role as S.A.M and despite how I feel about the show she did a great job and I hope she gets more roles soon.

It didn't get as good as other anime I've watched and its fight scenes needed a bit more work from what I can remember.The art was okay. It is not the best though. It was meh, like the series. I didn't exactly like it....The character development, from what I can remember, was meh, it wasn't too bad. I didn't exactly like it.What it needs is, in essence, another season.

Chou Seimeitai Transformers Beast Wars Neo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6511/Chou_Seimeitai_Transformers_Beast_Wars_Neo,"['Karyuudo Fansubs delivered us in may 2019 something that all Transformer: Beast Wars fans around the world would appreciate; mainly the final chapter of the Japanese spin-off of the Transformers Beast Era: Beast Wars Neo series that aired in Japan. Now this is a sequal  of the anime series Beast Wars II, so if you haven\'t seen that one, chances are you\'re better of watch that one first before you start this one just in case to prevent confusion. Sure, we all know the Transformers franchise only exists for purely one thing; \'to sell toys\', but that doesn\'t really bother me. I still have...my very own Beast Wars toys from when I was a kid if I may be honest. You can say all what you want, but I still do like the Beast Wars franchise - even though it\'s sadly discontineud.Story: 7/10 (Good)After the events of Beast Wars II with the dissapearance of the troops of Lio Convoy, many eons(?) later, Big Convoy gets assigned new crew members as Maximals (Cybertrons) to collect the Angelmois energy capsules scattered around the universe. This won\'t be an easy tast, since Magmatron\'s troops that are the new Predacons (Destrons) have their own purposes in collecting the Angelmois energy capsules.Caution: This anime relies a bit more on it\'s parent story named ""Tatakae! Chou Robot Seimeitai Transformers"" then the previous season Beast Wars II. But I assume if you\'re a Beast Wars fan, you would probbably already know that the Beast Era story line is just a side story from the original Transformers line.Art: 7/10 (Good)For a show that aired in 1999 the art is pretty decent to say the least. You could say nowadays it\'s a bit outdated, but for a 1999 show I think it still passes. Compaired with the previous season Beast Wars II and the spin-off movie, I can say animation wise it\'s a much better improvement for sure. Transformation scenes aren\'t that re-used anymore compaired with previous installments and you will see some alternatieve transformation footage through the series which is a huge step-up compaired with Beast Wars II. Really, I don\'t have much complaints at all.Sound: 6/10 (Fine)Sound wise not much is improved compaired with the previous season and side story movie, but it still get\'s the job done. It\'s just a bit of a shame the intro song and the ending song doesn\'t get changed over the 35 episodes (32 episodes and 3 clip-shows) for this series.Character: 6/10 (Fine)Compaired with the previous season, I personally find it a slighty downgrade compaired with Beast Wars II. Let me hear me out. I liked the charathers in Beast Wars II slighty better than the charathers in this anime. For example: I find the Maximals Stampy and Break personallity wise they are almost equal with each other and I\'m not a big fan of Heinrad iether. From all the charathers; I find the Predacons has the most interessing charathers for sure. I do like the Predacons named Dead End and Sling the most. Oh and our cute tsundere D-Navi that aids the Predacons.Here\'s a small summery of the main charathers in the show:Maximals:* Big Convoy: The leader of the Maximals. Can transform into a  woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius)* Longrack: The most serious one of the bunch. Can transform into a giraffe.* Colada: Rather wants to work alone. Prefers hot envoirements. Can transform into a cobra.* Stampy: A bit of coward compaired with other Maximals. Can transform into a rabbit.* Break: Looses it\'s patience very fast. Prefers cold envoirements. Can transform into an emperor pinguin.* Heinrad: He\'s the mellow one of the group and the most Japanese cultured of the group. Can transform into a tanuki (Japanese folklore creature).* Navi-chan: a talking computer that aids the Maximals in finding the Angelmois energy capsules scattered around the universes.Predacons:* Magmatron: The leader of the Predacons. Is a combiner Transformer between three differnt Mesozoic reptiles.* Guiledart: The right hand of Magmatron. Can transform into a Triceratops.* Saberback: Often mocks Sling. Can transform into a Stegosaurus.* Sling: Often gets used for comedic purposes. Can transform into a Dimetrodon.* Dead End: Doesn\'t like team work. Can transform into an ammonite.* D-Navi: a talking computer similair like Navi-chan, but she\'s a bit of a cute tsundere and her design is differnt.Other charathers gets introduced trough the series aswell just like previous entries.Enjoyment 8/10Did I enjoy this anime afterall? Yes I did. I\'m very glad I could finally completed the final missing piece of the Beast Era. I personally preffer this story line than the bullshit story we have gotten with Beast Machines here in the West. It just makes much more sense. Yes, I\'d like to pretend Beast Machines never happend. Even today.Overall: 7/10 (Good)If you\'re a Beast Wars fan you would enjoy this piece of content for sure. Even with it\'s obvious flaws, I think it did a much better job than *shudders* the Beast Era ending we have gotten in the west with Beast Machines. my very own Beast Wars toys from when I was a kid if I may be honest.

7**SpoilersUnicron appears in this show thats all i have to say', 'In a rare occurrence of Transformers media, the villains carry more personality and competence in comparison to the new set of protagonists for this show, the blundering Maximal recruits headed by Big Convoy. The only real reason the Predacons get thwarted is mostly because of plot convenience and dumb luck for the first half or so. Big Convoy more often than not has to be compelled by an outside force to lecture the group under him to get their act together. Unexpectedly, the one recruit who has severe anxiety manages to get more done plus following orders better than the majority of his peers, and...this same recruit is the one who seems to get the most development. Stampy being the one who slowly but surely finds his place. Few high praises can be said for many of the other recruits. Colada wavers between bull stubborn and getting things done, but I find his grumpy butt endearing. His sense of responsibility which sometimes pops up is probably what has him get along best with Stampy. Heinrad is negligible in personality and story development aside from the times he serves as a necessary, begrudging crux. Big Convoy could stand to be more involved, but due to his lone wolf nature, he struggles to connect with his recruits for a long time. It\'s not for lack of trying since he\'s gradually pushed to bolster and encourage them, lightening up in the process too. The other Maximals are generally a ""see for yourself"" kind of thing.The Predacons are really the ones stealing the show here character-wise:Magmatron has a reserved, threatening air and a reputation preceding him. The history regarding the fate of his home has him holding a deep-seated rage. Magmatron has a potential for power only matched by few like Big Convoy. The three dinosaur body shtick is admittedly goofy, but it carries a certain oomf with some of the animation.DNAVI, the Dinosaur ship\'s local menace and necessary arbiter of teleportation. You will call her by her chosen name at the moment or no teleporting back to the Dinosaur for you. The D stands for Devil for a reason.Guiledart may as well be one of Magmatron\'s hands. Unflinchingly loyal when the others want to abandon ship from Magmatron. Does not take flak for some doubting him, and he\'s somewhat justified in that. Very briefly becomes a father figure.Archadis comes into the picture a little later and rather snarkily. Pretentious chicken of an Archaeopteryx. Adept in sharpshooting, being nagged by Guiledart, and flipping his affinity for factions on a whim. Has the best laugh (it even calms down a baby).Sling, his poor synapsid soul, seems to be the metaphorical punching bag of the Predacons. He still tries his best where he can.Saberback has his mind set to vanity, often commenting on the beauty of things or the lack thereof. He wields powers of illusion and... magic? Not an entire jerk because he marginally cares about Sling.Dead End does little besides brooding and what he\'s ordered to. His character manages to be weaker than the sidestory Predacons\' personalities.Hydra is not a main Predacon, but nonetheless a standout in his short screen time. Awful jokes, nerdery, and loyalty up there with the likes of Guiledart.Neo has a slow, if annoying, start as the Maximal crew sets out on their pursuit of collecting Angolmois capsules before Magmatron and his crew of Predacons can get to them first. Right from the get-go, the Maximal recruits bicker among themselves while all Big Convoy can do is carry on with the mission given from higher-ups. Things ramp up with the introduction of the Blentrons, becoming the bigger problem at hand for both the Maximals and the Predacons. Other giant unsavory forces arrive at their doorstep too. Can the conflicted Maximals and Predacons do something about it?One of Neo\'s strongest points is the performance of the voice actors. I personally feel Holly Kaneko (Guiledart), Ren Tamura (Archadis), Show Ryuzanji (Magmatron), Junichi Inoue (Big Convoy), and Makoto Ueki (Colada) knocked it out of the park with their characters. They lend very well to their roles. It\'s hard to describe without hearing them in action. What I can say though is I can tell they had a blast doing it.Also, Break\'s VA may sound very familiar.Visuals... are a mixed bag. The characteristic transformation sequences as per usual are a delight, satisfyingly having the characters change into their modes. Character designs are distinctive and more in my opinion: stellar, but they might not be a viewer\'s fancy if they\'re used to or far more like the classic inorganic robot look of Transformers. Occasionally animation errors pop up that are very distracting. Among the memorable ones: Guiledart\'s face being a void for a hot minute and the animators never knowing how to settle on a single look for Archadis\' mouth.Following on the heels of Beast Wars II, Neo\'s opening and ending themes do not disappoint. Absolute bangers. The ambient music tracks do their job fine without taking from the moment. Not much else is notable with sound... maybe the Matrix Buster sequence though.Despite the drawbacks, there\'s still charm to be found. The very first Beat Wars series this is not - definitely not in the realm of plot complexity. Most of the enjoyment comes from how less seriously Beast Wars Neo takes itself. Neo is highly episodic until the later serious plot points settle in. It has the carefree tromp and goofy sincerity like a lot of 90s anime, and it\'s almost a last send off of shows of its time since it released the year before the next millennium ticked over.

Crying Freeman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1153/Crying_Freeman,"[""Freeman is crying. Freeman does not want to kill but binded by a brainwashing force, Freeman leaves tears every time he must assassin someone. A 29 year old virgin witnessed Freeman assassinate the yakuza. Will Freeman shoot her too? She is completely innocent. Seeing the face of Freeman, the virgin knows a killer face that will shoot even if crying and she will die a virgin, The person in charge of Freeman left an order to shoot the virgin and the yakuza still at large also want to shoot Freeman. If the yakuza shoot Freeman, then they will shoot the virgin too. Freeman at the...mercy of brain control can only cry and obey orders. The virgin is to die by his hands. Crying Freeman is not a law enforcement, but a yakuza assassin story. Freeman unlike his name is not free, but wishes to be free. He is crying because he is the best assassin yet must kill against his will. It's a sad story, of moral issues and judgment, and death is nothing to fear.

In a life of no freedom, it is Crying Freeman."", 'What do you get when you cross Sanctuary\'s setting, Hellsing\'s brutality, miscellaneous porn, and a storyline about as deep as Bleach? Crying Freeman.Crying Freeman is a potter that apparently seemed skilled to the Chinese mafia ""108 Dragons"". Through the magic of acupuncture, he becomes their ultimate assassin slave. He\'s programmed to do their dirty work despite how it tears up him inside and makes him cry. However, he quite evidently does have free will and he exercises it regularly. He doesn\'t cry out of pity for his victims; he often CHOOSES to kill people entirely on his own, then he cries simply because that\'s the...gimmick. In the first episode, he goes from slave to leader of 108 Dragons because... uh... because. Yep, by the end of the first episode, they\'ve already ruined everything that\'s supposed to catch your attention.The storyline is nonsensical at best. Beyond Freeman\'s hasty promotion, there\'s no development or purpose whatsoever. You can bet your ass there isn\'t a proper ending, so don\'t get suckered into watching the whole thing like I did if that\'s what you\'re hoping for. The characters contradict themselves. Freeman, an innocent man that goes out looking for trouble and killing people since that\'s what he does. Wife of Freeman, a delicate woman that would rather dance naked in front of a bloodthirsty gang than kill them when she has a sword in hand because she has no intentions of killing anyone, but she does it a lot later on. Each episode kinda has a plot, but it\'s always really stupid.In one episode, 10 people jump in front of Freeman one after another to take bullets for him... instead of one person sacrificing himself and everyone else pulling out a gun to kill the assailant. I couldn\'t take it seriously; I started laughing at how utterly stupid it was.There\'s so much completely needless nudity in this series. The first episode has a couple of sex scenes; why they felt it was so urgent to show us, I do not know. It adds nothing to the story whatsoever. Was it to try and show the characters are in love? Not at all. They go on about how deep their love is, but it\'s total bullshit. Freeman has sex with other women even though he\'s married. It was only AFTER he had some with some random woman that he asked her for her phone number, which she didn\'t even give to him. Yeah, that\'s some deep love there. After catching on, I skipped the sex scenes and nothing of value was lost. He preaches about his views on love in one episode and talks down to someone that believes love is about living for your partner. The guy he was insulting happened to be a rapist, but still, that\'s pretty arrogant.Anyhow, the nudity. This annoying, obese woman, Bayasan, is clothed one moment, then she\'s naked the next for no reason at all. She didn\'t even fight or anything while naked. They went home and simply didn\'t speak of it. The main characters often strip down before or during fighting, or sometimes they\'re simply naked from the get go.The violence is top notch. There\'s lots of blood and killing, and not in your usual way. It\'s often either swift assassin work with a knife or it\'s a knife fight. The animation is really cool for both, as well as all other fight/killing scenes. The knife fights are really badass with how the fighters are kinda hunched over with a knife in hand, slowly circling or moving towards each other, swinging and dodging elegantly. The art is very nice and the animation is detailed and smooth.I feel that I\'ve been betrayed. I could let one sex scene slide; I didn\'t think there\'d be shit like that in every episode. I didn\'t think this would be ero. If anything, I thought it\'d be the opposite; a sad story about an assassin that wishes he could stop killing people. He shouldn\'t have been made the leader of 108 Dragons, he never should\'ve had any personal motives to kill, and he shouldn\'t have been such a slut. A proper ending was too much to ask for since there wasn\'t even a proper storyline to begin with.This was somewhat enjoyable and its cheesiness made me laugh at times. The action scenes are awesome, the sex isn\'t need nor wanted (go watch some porn on your own time if you must; leave it out of my entertainment). To be frank, I\'d only recommend this to a handful of people with perverse taste. Otherwise, don\'t bother watching it. gimmick.

The first episode has a couple of sex scenes; why they felt it was so urgent to show us, I do not know. It adds nothing to the story whatsoever. Was it to try and show the characters are in love? Not at all. They go on about how deep their love is, but it\'s total bullshit. Freeman has sex with other women even though he\'s married. It was only AFTER he had some with some random woman that he asked her for her phone number, which she didn\'t even give to him. Yeah, that\'s some deep love there. After catching on, I skipped the sex scenes and nothing of value was lost. He preaches about his views on love in one episode and talks down to someone that believes love is about living for your partner. The guy he was insulting happened to be a rapist, but still, that\'s pretty arrogant.Anyhow, the nudity. This annoying, obese woman, Bayasan, is clothed one moment, then she\'s naked the next for no reason at all. She didn\'t even fight or anything while naked. They went home and simply didn\'t speak of it. The main characters often strip down before or during fighting, or sometimes they\'re simply naked from the get go.The violence is top notch. There\'s lots of blood and killing, and not in your usual way. It\'s often either swift assassin work with a knife or it\'s a knife fight. The animation is really cool for both, as well as all other fight/killing scenes. The knife fights are really badass with how the fighters are kinda hunched over with a knife in hand, slowly circling or moving towards each other, swinging and dodging elegantly. The art is very nice and the animation is detailed and smooth.I feel that I\'ve been betrayed. I could let one sex scene slide; I didn\'t think there\'d be shit like that in every episode. I didn\'t think this would be ero. If anything, I thought it\'d be the opposite; a sad story about an assassin that wishes he could stop killing people. He shouldn\'t have been made the leader of 108 Dragons, he never should\'ve had any personal motives to kill, and he shouldn\'t have been such a slut. A proper ending was too much to ask for since there wasn\'t even a proper storyline to begin with.This was somewhat enjoyable and its cheesiness made me laugh at times. The action scenes are awesome, the sex isn\'t need nor wanted (go watch some porn on your own time if you must; leave it out of my entertainment). To be frank, I\'d only recommend this to a handful of people with perverse taste. Otherwise, don\'t bother watching it.', ""Crying FreemanCrying Freeman is a messy piece of work, which includes a very bad story, mediocre art style, mediocre sound, bad character development and the only enjoyment you can have is the laughs one can have when watching the absurd story and how nonsensical it is.StoryThe story is poor on this one, the first time i have watched something so bad that i couldn't take any possitivity from it, although the beginning can be deceiving because the first ep. did things almost right, if i have to score it just for that one ep. i would give it a 7 and it would deserve that...for the fact that it was good, seeing this man crying because he has to kill and can't get out of this life style and then finding love in someone that he has to kill (after having consensual sex, both virgins too) and risking his life to almost being killed and proving the organization (108 dragons) that he would die for her and then he's told to rescue her and forget his name Yo Hinomura to have a new life with her at that moment i thought he was going to be betrayed by them and thus suffering (although it seemed like a TV drama serie for the obvious reasons) but next ep. was not what i expected, now all of a sudden we are introduced to both with different names and married by the organization, now Yo/Long is the leader of the clan and Emu his wife, then a fair amount of nonsense thrown here and there with a weird storyline, he wants to make the things peacefully and that's ok but after that the next eps. were dropping in quality even further and becomes absurd and bad and more nonsensical and WTF?, and a lot of soft hentai scenes, he fu**s a lot of women that fall for him in two min. and is infidel towards Emu but hey he's the action hero right? so who cares?; They like to be naked too, almost every time they are naked and he cries but it's not for remorse because he kills whenever he wants, crying is just a gimmick, he likes to be the leader and f**k girls so why cry? because he was hypnotized by the clan to do so, as he doesn't know why he cries neither but is not for remorse and the ending was bad, a sex scene with his wife saying that he will only love her or something along those lines but he fu**ed more girls than the times he fu**ed his wife, is just a messy very bad story.Art & AnimationI was surprised with the animation of the first ep. from an '88 aired ep. really detailed and great gun fight scenes and the art style was good for that time, i was wow look at the detailed gun shots, bullet holes and blood but, each and every single next eps. the art style and animation was getting really bad and different from ep. 1 which had the best character design and better overall but it was mediocre in the end.SoundThe music started really great with a couple or more songs that reminded me of the 80's action movies from Van Damme to Kurt Russel or Steven Seagal etc. movies (i like a lot the 80's songs and the New Wave 80's song like the ones from Far Cry Blood Dragon) but later it was repetitive out of place and not the same from the first ep. which had better songs, so it was mediocre.CharacterThe characters made the story, so that means they were bad, i kind of liked Freeman at first but later on it was predictable what he was going to do, and their interaction is dull, it was cringe worthy at times, the characters are always changing in mood or personality, so it was confusing for me just like for them, i didn't felt that much impact when a certain character was raped by a guy who had a family and was criticising Freeman for having sex and spread his love with other women and not with his wife but he's no one to say that when he raped a woman and throw her to the ocean to a possible death (and that part was absurd and nonsensical because she found a radio transmissor to contact Freeman but why would a big ass radio transmissor be in the sewers?) and he dares to talk about love and be with one while he might already raped more than one woman, c'mon bad character development.EnjoymentThie first ep. is good, other eps. are bad, no enjoyment value other than the laughs at how absurd this was and how random things happens in some absurd ways, it was bad, the first 4 i give to an anime too and it deserves it and even lower. for the fact that it was good, seeing this man crying because he has to kill and can't get out of this life style and then finding love in someone that he has to kill (after having consensual sex, both virgins too) and risking his life to almost being killed and proving the organization (108 dragons) that he would die for her and then he's told to rescue her and forget his name Yo Hinomura to have a new life with her at that moment i thought he was going to be betrayed by them and thus suffering (although it seemed like a TV drama serie for the obvious reasons) but next ep. was not what i expected, now all of a sudden we are introduced to both with different names and married by the organization, now Yo/Long is the leader of the clan and Emu his wife, then a fair amount of nonsense thrown here and there with a weird storyline, he wants to make the things peacefully and that's ok but after that the next eps. were dropping in quality even further and becomes absurd and bad and more nonsensical and WTF?, and a lot of soft hentai scenes, he fu**s a lot of women that fall for him in two min. and is infidel towards Emu but hey he's the action hero right?

If you’re going into this thinking that you’re going to get a cute romance between a gangster and a regular girl, you’re dead wrong. I feel like all of the romance geeks that might come to watch this will actually be quite disappointed. Although there are little sprinkles of romance in this, it’s mostly violent crime syndicate battles and sex and not every sex scene...or romantic moment is with the same woman even if it’s with the same man.What Crying Freeman does best is it’s characters, sometimes the character development is a bit rough and I’m certain it’s because it was adapting a 76 chapter manga into a 6 episode anime (although the episodes were all around 58 minutes long). Yet, I still found myself attached to the characters.The pacing of the storyline is definitely a bit quick, but the plot is always interesting and even if it goes into a wild direction it’s still hard to not be entertained by it. Of course, there were some things that had me rolling my eyes and because of the absurdity but at the same time, it was still a fun and entertaining watch. Don’t take it too seriously and I’m sure you’ll have fun with it. The plot is ridiculous, it’s all just the writer going “what if we put him in this situation, he’ll obviously win but who will we make him have sex with and how does he kill them”. You can tell that whoever created this and directed it was having a lot of fun and I guess I can respect that.It’s definitely not a masterpiece but it’s great for what it was and I enjoyed myself a lot.

One that rages when, before his very eyes, they kill the high members of an organization he was brainwashed by and forced into and decides to do Tai-chi immediately after.If you take into consideration the craziness and totally absurd setting of the late 80s and early 90s and regard this piece as an absolute parody work intended to express sexual fantasies just for the sake of it, then you're gonna have a splendid time laughing just like I did :)When the OVAs first came out, they were considered very controversial and somewhat a masterpiece. This kind of bold and...crazy plot with no real sense used to be acceptable back in the days much easier than it might be today. I chose to watch this because it was very prominent back in the 90s, it even spawned several live action movies so I wanted to see what it actually was about and BOY did I not see this coming xD Is it terrible? No, not really, but it IS a mess.

Each episode roughly year apart and I come at it from a VERY different PLACE. So did the writer director which is refreshing.  ImhoOther reviews proclaim continuity issues, the xcess pointless nudity, unusual nonsensical character development.  But each episode is a FULL YEAR apart.  Your NOT gonna get standard series style character developement under these conditions.  TO PRETEND SO IS SILLY.So right off the bat just get yourself OUTa of the 12-24 episode series character developemnt.  I believe we are meant...to understand this.Now for EXCESS NUDITY I gotta tell ya there's A LOT!  MAJOR AMOUNTS.  But it's not pornographic in nature to me.  Here's why.  There are 100s of samples of cultures fighting naked covering their bodies in WARPAINT TO SCARE THE OPPONENT.THE anime of late has SOOOO MANY tropes in it of the UNBEARABLE shyness of touching, and any boy that likes boobs, panties, etc is hentai pervert over and over ad nauseum thru the whole show.  Whoever decided this makes ANY sense to true human nature was mentaly broken.  I DESPISE this part of anime and there's NONE of it here thank the gods.I believe in the 108 dragons they received EXTRAOREINARILY GORGEOUS FULL BODY TATOOS IMHO that was the dragons warpqint  And it IS beautiful honestly.  I loved this aspect.  Lon Tayans dragon, mother Lus full body tiger tattoo and LU chinran front and back tiger calling to the dragon is simply marvelous.  A snake and Phoenix appear later as well and I wish they'd used episode 1 detailish design in episode 5-6, especially the Phoenix.The ONLY mortal sin in this tattooed warrior design....aBayasan should have a moon bear tatoo covering her giant body.  The moon bear was the single largest animal occupying the highland regions of Japan.  The bear also represents the guardian mountain spirit Yama no kami and is both a fierce protector but benevolent.  I think this would have fit her perfectly.  Imho.For more on the moon bear significance read this essay...fascinating.https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/783Also in many societies, people are initiated naked to secret societies do show they have thrown away their past selves.  So APPRECIATE the truly PRIMAL NATURE of the naked scenes and don't view it as porn or bloody fanservice.  It's not meant to be.Also contrary to societal norms, there are  many many open relationships where two people love each other  deeply but switch partners now and then to spice things up.  Hard to digest for some but it's everywhere you don't look.  I have many friends  like this and they are more happily married than half the other monogamous ones honestly.And finally, mafia world is flooded with sex. Hell it's prolly half their revenue. These stories wouldn't be nearly as authentic without it.  Imagine Elfen lied without nudity and pure gore.  Daughters of mneumosin REN without nudity and Gore.  Neither can I imagine Freeman without the nudity and sex and gore.So I believe we are to see this nudity and sexual Scenes from these perspectives.  Also Lon Tyan crying freeman in later series as the leader of the 108'must tackle a TRULY life threatening undercover infiltration to an evil 2nd group to avenge dark eyes.  To do this he must have a LOT of sex with another woman.  This isn't betrayal but his job as the leader take it or leave it.  This also happens in modern day ALL THE TIME But clearly noone told some reviews. You DO YOUR JOB if it involves sex so be it.  That in no way means it involves love.So overall, I found the erotic stuff tasteful and necessary, the TATOOS AMAZING. The TATOOS took an animation hit in episode 4 and weren't as amazing on Lu Chinran but recover somewhat in 5-6.  overall as yearly OVAs they had continuity and we're very enjoyable.Frankly they stand out as very unique, lacking all normal conventions of today's anime which is a good thing.I also found the GIANT sister BAYASAN to be some comic relief here and there and a great support character to the general storyline.So I say watch it, relax about the nudity.  It's cultural, NO fanservice or hentai.  It's none of those things.  I honestly wish there were more or a reboot would come along.  Same visceral sex, nudity, violence but in episodic.9 overall.Thanks for reading, hope u enjoy them as I did. to understand this.Now for EXCESS NUDITY I gotta tell ya there's A LOT!  MAJOR AMOUNTS.

Yes, they are poorly thought out and written, but nonetheless I feel that some things need to be said because this is quite an odd series. Spoilers, btw.It starts off pretty decent. A lot of action and violence with some fairly unique kills. The story had my interest initially, but it soon becomes nonsensical and difficult to follow. I'm scoring it as high as I am only because of how bizarre the series is overall (even for anime). If you have nothing better to watch then it's worth checking out solely based on how...trippy it is. It lacks a lot of the typical anime tropes of the time, while also having its own tropes and driving them into the ground (if that makes any sense). A few things to point out:-The main cast is constantly getting naked to fight (or just show off their bodies I guess), they'd be better off not wearing clothes at all. I can understand how it would be advantageous in combat, but still... it's a bit overdone. Now that I think about it, a lot of other characters are randomly naked at times too including almost every woman that ever appears. That's just Crying Freeman I guess.-Freeman and his wife become the leaders of the 108 Dragons and immediately fall into their roles like it's nothing. It's especially strange for his wife since she starts out as a lonely nerdy type with a mundane life and turns into a badass mob boss in the span of an episode or two. A complete 180. I will say that she is probably my favorite character though. I like her design, she has a distinct look compared to the typical women in 80's/90's anime. As far as personality, not much there after the first episode. None of the characters had much personality or logical development imo.-There are a ton of sex scenes. Freeman has sex with a different woman (usually more than one) in nearly every episode, even though he's married. And if he doesn't flat-out make love to them he's kissing them or doing sexual things while they fight to the death. It's just hilarious in a way, especially since Freeman never really shows emotion or acts perverted otherwise. And neither his wife nor any allies ever mention it or scold him for it. It's truly random, but again, I guess that's just Crying Freeman.-Most of the English voice acting is decent, but then you have certain minor characters with god-awful voice acting that doesn't fit the character at all. Not to mention the tidbits of totally hilarious and cringe dialogue (especially the blonde villain in the final episode).-Wtf happened at the end of episode 3? I'm not even gonna try to describe it, but just... wtf? Maybe it's cause I watched the dub and something got lost in translation? It just didn't make sense to me. In fact, the whole side story of Hino obtaining the Muramasa blade seemed to come out of nowhere and added nothing to the overall plot. Maybe I just wasn't paying attention and missed a few details. The latter half of the series felt like each episode could have been part of any other random series if not for having the same cast.-The fight scenes get pretty bland halfway through and the plot goes all over the place and doesn't make much sense. It feels like the producers kinda gave up and did anything they could just to finish the series. I really wanted to like this show but the only thing that really makes it stand out is how wild it is. As for the art, animation, sound, etc. it's all pretty standard. Not bad but also nothing remarkable. Oh, there is one episode where the art style randomly changes a bit and the shadows are done with cross-hatching. Not sure why this was done since they reverted back in the next episode, but I personally enjoyed it and don't see that style often.Overall, it feels rushed and could have been fleshed out much better, perhaps with more episodes and/or effort. There is a lot of content that feels like filler and takes away from the overall plot and pacing. Then again, I feel the same about a lot of other older OVAs of this era.This review turned out much longer than I intended.

ClassicaLoid,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31157/ClassicaLoid,"['**REVIEW IS OUTDATED. IT\'LL BE UPDATED ONCE I FINISH THE ANIME**I\'m not the type of person to sit down and write reviews, but seeing as this astounding show has such a low score here on MAL, I want to clear some things up: While having musical knowledge really gives you an insight on the puns and references, you don\'t need it in order to enjoy it to its greatest. The jokes are top-quality, the art style is stupendous, and the characters absolutely make this show.ClassicaLoid is about certain famous composers, such as Beethoven and Mozart, who have been ""resurrected"" into the modern world. Obviously not...as reflections of how they looked in the past, but their characters are based off the personality of the composer they are based off.Without a doubt, this is definitely a very trippy and wacky show, having more jokes than it does a story. The ""plot"" is really more of background fodder, which explains why these guys are here, but up here \'til episode 11, it hasn\'t really had much of an effect on the story itself... Kind of. Whatever the case, this is definitely more of an episodic anime over a storyline one, so every episode has its own little mini ""story"" and without a doubt, you will always be experiencing one or two laughs along the way. Probably more. Most likely more. At the end of the day, the characters are all just so simply lovable and charming, and they definitely make this a show more than watch-worthy.Don\'t let the low score steer you away from this astounding show. It\'s crazy and weird, but in a good way. This show definitely deserves a wider audience.I\'ll edit my review once the show finishes airing to give a better review : > as reflections of how they looked in the past, but their characters are based off the personality of the composer they are based off.Without a doubt, this is definitely a very trippy and wacky show, having more jokes than it does a story.

Whatever the case, this is definitely more of an episodic anime over a storyline one, so every episode has its own little mini ""story"" and without a doubt, you will always be experiencing one or two laughs along the way. Probably more. Most likely more. At the end of the day, the characters are all just so simply lovable and charming, and they definitely make this a show more than watch-worthy.Don\'t let the low score steer you away from this astounding show. It\'s crazy and weird, but in a good way. This show definitely deserves a wider audience.I\'ll edit my review once the show finishes airing to give a better review : >', ""Classicaloid is about all the great classical composers brought to life, not exactly but you can see Beethoven and Mozart. They have this mysterious power called musik. As it appears they were made for an unknown reason. It's a very funny and light show with some some action now and then. The best part is Beethoven's unnatural obsession with gyoza. You can relax and enjoy the comedy and the remix of famous classical pieces of music. The art isn't fancy but it goes well with the story. The Classicaloid characters are enjoyable and interesting to watch. Classical music lovers in particular will enjoy this show...as they watch the makers of their favorite music acting silly instead of picturing them stiff pieces of wood. as they watch the makers of their favorite music acting silly instead of picturing them stiff pieces of wood."", 'As a classical musician, I was really thrilled with the premise of this anime. I was excited to see what kind of characterization would take place and how each composer\'s music would be adapted in a modern day context.With that said, I couldn\'t finish the first episode the first time around. I wasn\'t quite ready for the experience ClassicaLoid was trying to give me. We\'ve got a rambunctious house full of maladjusted geniuses. There\'s a lot of fun, a lot of chaos, and a lot of music. Once you commit to the madness though, you\'re in for an interesting ride.The Story - 5; Without any...spoilers, I must say that the story is a bit weak and takes a bit to unfold. I\'m almost sure that the storyline intentionally takes a backseat to the comedic antics and absurdity that makes the backbone of this show. The last two episodes really floored me, honestly. You watch an anime like this for the experience, not the story.Art - 8; I really like the style and think it works well. Love how each character really has their own aesthetic. Beethoven is undoubtedly Beethoven. What\'s also nice is that the style remains consistent and there\'s little/no change in quality over the span of the series.Music - 6; Man, was I let down by some of the arrangements featured in this show. Instead of lamenting some of the weak music, I\'ll highlight what I did like. The arrangement of the ""Alla Turca"" from Mozart\'s Piano Sonata No. 11 into a ""Thriller"" mashup was borderline genius and hilarious. The story behind and presentation of ""Fur Elise"" was also hilarious. These two alone kinda overshadow some of the duds and really heightened the comedy for me.Characterization - 6; This is a tough part to talk about because it\'s probably my biggest gripe with the show. Some characters are done nicely, even if their antics get repetitive or annoying--namely Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt, and Tchaikovsky. Some characters are too one-dimensional for my liking, though. I would\'ve liked to see more out of Chopin, especially his friendship with Liszt. Schubert is basically thrown under the bus from his introductory episode until episode 21. It\'s a shame he was made to be not a whole lot more than a Beethoven fanboy, when he was quite a composer in his own right historically. It started to grate my nerves how lazy the script would get at times, with Schubert doing nothing more than agreeing with Beethoven or shouting ""sempai"" intermittently. There\'s a lot more content to explore with these characters and their musicality outside of odd quirks (like Beethoven wanting to create his own guitar...) wasn\'t explored a whole lot, which is disappointing, especially with the Musik they wield not having as much context without the whole notion that, hey, these men lived and died by their music.Overall - 6; Many enjoyable moments, but not an anime to be taken seriously or to go into with any expectations whatsoever. The first few episodes are slow, but as soon as you get the first inkling of an idea that this series might be as nuts as it is, you might be hooked. spoilers, I must say that the story is a bit weak and takes a bit to unfold.

The plot is very thin with this anime. There is an actual purpose for the creation of the Classicaloids, but it’s irrelevant for most of its run. Only within the last 2 or 3 episodes does something reminiscent of a plot happen, until then we are treated to a lot of episodic nonsense. I found the comedy to be very repetitive, it’s basically one of the Classicaloids acting like a total numbnut, causing a massive chaos or one of them gone missing and the others (for whatever reason)...wanting them back. The introductory episodes in the beginning of the series were the best in my eyes, since the characters were still fresh by then and the interactions not stale yet. While many anime nowadays suffer from being only 1-cour, Classicaloid would have done so much better if it was, instead we get a heavily dragged out 2-cour anime that gets boring way too fast.3/10Art:It’s…colorful. That’s almost all the positive things I have to say about the art. The characters look somewhat clunky and unreal with those big borders around them. There are tons of off-model shots as well. The animation isn’t much to brag about either, only the times the Classicaloids use their powers look slightly appealing, but after a while these effects start to lose their charms. I sometimes got the feeling Studio Sunrise is trying to produce a Trigger show but they don’t know how to do that, but I have a wild imagination, so don’t take this as a fact. Bottom line, Classicaloid looks very cheap and lackluster and it doesn’t feel like the animation department was very ambitious with this show.3/10Sound:An anime about music should sound extraordinary good, shouldn’t it? Well, not really. Obviously, we get to hear a lot of classical compositions of the characters’ namesakes, but unfortunately they are mostly mediocre at best J-Pop mixes of said pieces. There are a few positive exceptions, like Mozart’s Turkish March remixed with Michael Jackson’s Thriller or the show’s version of Swan Lake, but most of them sound very lame. The voice acting is okay mostly, there’s nobody doing a bad job there. The opening song falls into the same category as the rest of the soundtrack while the endings are just reprises of songs used in the respective episode. I mean, it’s cool they use all those classic pieces at all (and possibly teach young viewers about their composers), but it could have been done so much better.4/10Characters:The composers are portrayed as exaggerations of the originals. Mozart for example is a carefree, childish ladies man, Tchaikovsky is a grumpy alcoholic and so on. This may get old really fast (and it does), but it’s not that much of a problem. I was much more horrified by the sheer amount of dickery they evince towards each other and even more towards Kanae. That poor girl is forced to let them stay at her house, she does all the housework, cleans, cooks, washes, and all they ever do is make her life as miserable as possible. The same goes for Sousuke, who is basically a humanoid parasite. Maybe the show would have been more enjoyable if it had more likeable characters.3/10Enjoyment:There are tons of anime that should be 2-cours or more, but are forced to squeeze themselves into 12 or 13 episodes. Classicaloid is the exact opposite. At least half of the episodes were screaming “FILLER!” into my face, provided one beliefs that this show has an actual ongoing story. Classicaloid CAN be funny at times, but these times are so rare, that it just bored me most of the time. I mean, just look at how lackluster this review is. It didn’t hurt to watch and I didn’t want to end my life or anything, but if I had another chance, I would choose not to watch it again. Maybe you will enjoy it much more, who knows, humor is subjective after all.3/10Overall:3.2/10 wanting them back.

If you want an anime that's colorful, fun, and musical, i'd highly suggest it."", '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)When I was in high school, prepping for my college-entrance exams, I would sometimes listen to classical music.I read online somewhere that it could calm one’s nerves and increase thinking capacity. Wanting every edge available to me, I made it a point to play these pieces when the opportunity arose. Mozart’s “Le Nozze di Figaro, K. 492” was usually my go-to choice for its rising-and-falling notes.I don’t listen to a whole lot of classical music nowadays; metal has instead trounced everything else. But, as ClassicaLoid depicts, metal and many other motifs go together with the...classics more so than one may initially believe.STORYKanae is a typical high-school girl who happens to be the caretaker of her family’s spacious mansion. A mansion that also houses the so-called ClassicaLoids, reincarnations of extremely famous composers such as Beethoven, Mozart, and so on. However, these now-modern geniuses bring both mischief and craziness through their quirks and their abilities, leaving Kanae, her childhood friend Sousuke, and everyone else to deal with one ClassicaLoid situation after another.As almost exclusively a comedy, ClassicaLoid attempts to tickle its audience’s funny bone not with a feathery quill but rather a conductor’s baton, filling the air with musical romps and lots of other noises. While it has its crescendos, the anime unfortunately has its diminuendos, too.One of the show’s biggest strengths comes through in its weirdness. For it can get very strange. A mother and her son fart in the other’s direction for some bonding time. A merleopon statue takes the form of a censored-out penis. Fried tangerines replace heads and give way to creepy flower monsters. At one point, everyone except Hasshie the bird and Pad-kun the device turns into a fish. Aliens terrorize the Earth until they hear the blissful tones of all Eight Sounds in unison.In other words, ClassicaLoid hits many different spots on the randomized map, going wherever it so desires to achieve laughter.This random nature doesn’t always seem to align with the anime’s goals, however. Liszt’s “girls’ day out” and Beethes worrying about creating the perfect cup of coffee using exactly sixty beans has very little to do with the classical, instrumental, and musical motifs that the anime so regularly follows. Indeed, their Musik applies to pretty much anything, meaning these elements aren’t so much a driving force for the comedy as they are an excuse for the anime to do whatever it wants without regard.That’s being too harsh, though. In fact, ClassicaLoid not strictly sticking with music-centric jokes and funnies is precisely the point of the premise. These ClassicaLoids are the modernized versions of their old-school counterparts. Watching them try to find the correct ingredient for jet-black gyoza or fail to do the simplest of chores makes for a silly contrast that helps with the anime’s comedic angle.Otherwise, the anime does focus on the Musik, providing the audience with one new colorful performance nearly once every episode. Mozart’s “Symphony No. 25 in G Minor – K. 183.” Chopin’s “Nocturne No. 2.” Liszt’s “Liebesträume No. 3.” While they get reused occasionally, the show makes a clear effort to pack in as many of these famous pieces as it can muster.In doing so, more comedy comes forth through the very crux of these compositions. For example, in episode four, Schubert performs “Lullaby” whenever he gets particularly excited, infantilizing those around him. Then, in the very next episode, Beethes performs his “Piano Concerto 5 in E Minor.” It also goes by the title “Emperor Concerto” which, coincidentally enough, summons emperor penguins to do his bidding. And all the way down into episode nineteen, Tchaiko’s “Swan Lake” forces the residents of Kanae’s mansion to romantically pair up so that a bunch of “swans” can whisk them away.Simultaneously, ClassicaLoid has other, smaller jokes to fill the space between everything else. As Beethes plays his “Violin Sonata No. 9” (or “Kreutzer”), Pad-kun dons a Victorian-era wig to match the occasion. Or how, during Sousuke’s torturous “Boku Futsuu,” the eyes on Motes’ eel costume X themselves out as he “dies” from the aural pain. These smaller moments and details keep the comedy going even when the focus lies elsewhere.Beneath the comedy, a looming subplot exists, tying many of the episodes and their events together. It involves Bach, the “evil” ruler of a production company, and his plot for something grander. Unfortunately, it never really gains much focus, it doesn’t affect the characters to any worthwhile degree, and it ultimately doesn’t matter when his device breaks down (twice).ClassicaLoid also includes touchy-feely snippets. Kanae’s grandmother’s influence on her from the first episode brings a twinge of drama. And background scenes, like Kanae’s father saving Beethes and Motes from the facility that created them, offer minute explanations as to how this whole shebang came about. They slightly balance out the heavy amount of comedy and provide a better foundation for the plot, but these elements are either too infrequent or too unimportant to impact the anime, getting in the way of the comedy that ClassicaLoid creates.This combined weak subplot with weaker plot elements isn’t the best means for the show to get across its larger message, but at least it tries for something.Near the end of the season, Bach’s plan of normalizing music isn’t seen as beneficial but rather detrimental. Kanae describes such a musically averaged world as “lonely.” That “special music for special days” is only so because music isn’t everywhere. As her mini flashback depicts, the events her and the other characters went through are dear memories. Memories that, like music, are precious precisely because they represent one’s own experiences.Again, a nice sentiment. But, with the story steeped in ridiculousness, the anime makes it tough to walk away from this story with anything else besides Musik and comedy in mind.ART & ANIMATIONClassicaLoid has a bit of an interesting style thanks to some specific artistic choices.A lot of the intrigue comes from the characters’ designs. They generally stick out from their surroundings due to thick outlines and loud outfits. Quirky colors and classical inspiration further their outspoken looks.For example, Beethes’ has his signature frazzled, white hair, but he wears a black leather jacket, contrasting his colors and highlighting his rocker gusto. Motes goes all pink with a big pillow-like hat and a tied sweater. In comparison, Schubert’s circular frames, mustard coat, and knee-high socks with brown pants hearken back to his era. Liszt’s orange eyes with embroidered-light-green dress, Bach’s disco attire with famous wig, and Chopin’s purple cape and long-silvered clothes continue ClassicaLoid’s nifty trend.Most notably, the Musik performances make a concerted effort to be as involved and as spontaneous and as weird as possible. Mozart will cause machines to literally dance in humanoid fashion. Bąda’s ritualistic sun both hypnotizes her fans and melts Tchaiko alive. Schubert spits fire, turning everyone into living graffiti which in turn pays homage to the classic PaRappa the Rapper video-game series.These segments go wherever they want to, introducing a lot of variety in the visuals. Moreover, they also increase the level of detail, highlighting the importance of the performances. Literal musical notes float through the air. Colors explode. Movement abounds. Entire settings morph. Altogether, these performances are some of the best moments in the show thanks to their involved, fantastical directionIn general, though, ClassicaLoid doesn’t wow too much. The inside of Kanae’s mansion and the brief glimpses of the local city aren’t rife with pizzazz. Actual animation also remains barley passable whenever the characters are neither performing nor going overboard with their actions. Plus, it isn’t ashamed to reuse frames, like during Motes’s Musik performance at the end of episode twenty.Altogether, it’s a toss-up like that of the story. That is, the anime focuses a lot on a couple of specific areas, but many of the surrounding parts do not hold the same level of strength, ultimately reducing its final sense of worth.CHARACTERSClassicaLoid’s comedy only comes about because of the crazy cast of characters that wave their batons throughout the season. As legends of the classical era reincarnated, one would probably expect Beethoven and Mozart and the others to carry an air of power and formality. Instead, they stir up all manner of trouble through their large penchant for wackiness.Beethes cannot get enough of gyoza, a Chinese-inspired Japanese dish that wraps delectable foodstuffs in a doughy, grilled wrapper. More specifically, he can’t get enough of perfecting his gyoza, for Beethes strives for nothing less than mastery of the arts. Thus, he’s overzealous in almost anything he does (with a flamethrower often somewhere nearby). So long as his passions aren’t suppressed and his fate is his to control, he’s a very happy, very loud, and very musical man.Motes cares less about music and more about having a grand old time. He constantly pulls pranks, makes jokes, and creates extra, unnecessary problems for everyone else at the mansion. While he continues to not follow the rules by rolling around through the hallways on his roller-shoes, he still has a kind heart in that none of his actions are designed with malice in mind. Him becoming the local “unidentified monster” to mother a weak fawn demonstrates handily enough that this prankster isn’t so bad after all.Liszt thinks neither about gyoza nor pranks. Instead, she adamantly promotes a single facet of life: love. Thinking about her “little kitten” and watching out for her box-wearing friend, Liszt adores the expression of love in all its sincere, nonsensical forms. As a man-turned-bodacious-babe, she’s arguably the most normal, most mature of the group – but that’s not saying a whole lot.Chopin goes in the complete opposite direction; he cannot tolerate people. A recluse in all but name, he locks himself away in his room, shopping online for new items and playing video games to earn that next piece of rare loot. When he does leave his “cave,” he either hides beneath a box or keeps himself way off in the distance. Alongside his occasional blunt remarks, his generally pessimistic vibe keeps the outgoing personalities around him from overtaking the show outright.Schubert arrives a bit later than the others, but his oddball behavior fits right in. He idolizes Beethes, chasing after and defending the famous musician as much as humanly possible. In contrast, he hates Motes to the core and refuses to accept him as a friend. Schubert also accidentally loses control of his Musik whenever he gets too excited which, in turn, leaves him without much respect among his peers. That is, if they even remember that he is there to begin with.Outside of the main legends, Bach, Tchaiko, and Bąda watch from afar. Bach tends to converse in only musical jargon. Tchaiko flits about in fits of rage. Bąda is the only actual female composer – and, as she is often reminded, the only one-hit wonder of the group. They are the bad-guys-but-not-really of the show, and, while they’re not as prevalent as Beethes and the others, they add their own personality and their own fun into the mix.Despite their origins, none of the characters achieve comedic genius. Plus, their characteristics seem a far cry from their historic selves. Yet the anime incorporates the backgrounds of these real-life composers, often taking some creative liberties to make everything a bit more interesting.For instance, in one episode, Chopin falls for an online avatar named Jolly, connecting back to the light of his life during his original years. Tchaiko’s whole character also counts. Her real name is Pyotr Illyich Tchaikovsky, an old Russian composer. Now an underage girl, the anime plays up her angry attitude, her devotion to Bach, and the fact that she cannot drink alcohol.Certain characters, like Beethes and Motes, do get some more serious exploration of their characters peppered in throughout ClassicaLoid. Beethes contemplates the time when he was deaf, pushing him to achieve greatness. And Motes reels in the pranks and the goofiness to showcase that he can get serious and introspective when he so chooses.Of particular note, Schubert goes through what can only be described as tangible character development. Late into the season, he becomes fed up with how everyone either forgets or does not seem to care about him. In retaliation, he changes his whole persona, ditching the soft, classical approach and adopting instead a set of sick rapping beats.These moments aren’t too impactful, rarely pop up, and honestly don’t matter much when almost everything else seeps with comedy. Liszt not even receiving a specialized episode for herself when almost everyone else gets one argues for this statement well enough. Nevertheless, these slight departures keep the variety going while trying for something new that the anime never had to.The remaining important characters are not ClassicaLoids but humans: Kanae, Sousuke, Mitsuru, and Kyougo.Kanae is the technical main protagonist of this tale, but, understandably, the composers overshadow her presence. She oversees the mansion, “collects” rent, and yells at her tenants to go away on more than one occasion. Strict and unforgiving, she berates the others for their continual stress-inducing lifestyles. While she has a couple of asides about her deceased grandmother, and she rags on her dad for his irresponsible behavior, her main role is mostly to provide some semblance of sanity within this wild group of Musik-making crazies.Similarly, Sousuke is the non-ClassicaLoid music guy in the party. Unfortunately, he isn’t the best musician, and he usually finds himself with the short end of the stick. He’s Kanae’s childhood friend, he hangs out at the mansion because why not, and he’s more or less a pretty all right dude. He nearly kills everyone with his horrendous, self-made composition, but he at least got a few fans (even if they seemed to be laughing at, not with, him). Plus, he (alongside Kanae) helps to save the world from the alien invasion. So, even though Sousuke isn’t the most noteworthy character in the show, he manages to make a name for himself nonetheless.As for Mitsuru and Kyougo, they were the scientists who created the ClassicaLoids, sparking this whole story to begin with. Mitsuru views Bach as a deity, erroneously going out of her way to bring his plans to fruition. Kyougo is Kanae’s dad and means well, but he only does what he wants to do, traveling everywhere and appearing at the most convenient of times. Sadly, she’s a rather boring “villain,” and he’s hardly around enough to remain relevant to both the comedy and the story at large.That’s a lot of comedy-based characters in a show. If they were completely on their own, it wouldn’t quite work because their schticks can only be carried so far. In this big group, though, the anime can pick and choose among a variety of simultaneous craziness, leading to inevitable funnies that keep the spirit and the Musik of the show alive.MUSIC & SOUNDClassicaLoid’s opening track does not get replaced despite such an occurrence being so common for anime spanning multiple seasons. A wise decision on the show’s part, for this OP stands as one of its strongest features. The guitarist rocks out, fretting with finesse and creating one slick lick after another. Loud, rousing notes stomp down in dominance. Classical inspiration can clearly be heard in its harpsichord and its violins, and the lack of lyrics calls back to that time when only the instrumentals truly mattered. It’s catchy. It’s dynamic. It’s fun. An all-around superb piece.In a similar vein, ClassicaLoid goes above and beyond with its choice musical pieces. Known as “Musik,” the anime modernizes classical compositions that befit the characters and their zany situations. Techno, rock ‘n’ roll, avant-garde. At about one new modernization per episode, the anime contains too many to list out in full. Suffice it to say, they maintain a huge amount of diversity while staying true to their originals, justifying the anime’s formal name for this collection of creations.In fact, the anime is so confident in its Musik that it reuses them for each of its ending tracks. That’s not a fault against the anime but rather a positive. Getting to hear these songs once again with the conclusion of every episode makes for a tiny treat that satiates the ear’s palate.Once again, like the story and the art, the anime has put its eggs all in one basket. Because, ironically enough, the rest of the original soundtrack, what comprises most of the music heard throughout the season, fails to live up to its lauded brethren.Lackluster and almost forgettable, it feels as if the Musik (understandably) stole all the attention to the point that these tracks miss out on any appeal. They don’t feel like preludes to the Musik so much as they seem like one-off opening acts at a concert where people only showed up to listen to the main, magical gigs that arrive on stage afterwards.And, while the voice acting performances do not reach incredible status, many of them bring what they can to the piano bench. Specifically, Tomokazu Sugita as Beethes pursues life with a determined, manly voice, Mikako Komatsu as Kanae berates her guests with chiding tones, and Aya Endou as Tchaiko squabbles with rage.ENJOYMENTAfter finishing this show, it made me think about something that I don’t always keep in mind.When it comes to anime, films, and books, stories exist out there that unfortunately get lost along the way. That’s almost impossible to avoid in these mediums given how there are so many to choose. Of course, some will be semi-popular, some will stick out in the minds of critics and fans alike, and some will earn an infamous reputation that keeps future viewers away.The majority of these stories, though, fall somewhere in the middle. They don’t do anything particularly egregious, but they don’t do anything particularly noteworthy either. Maybe they have an aspect or two that seems interesting, or maybe the project has a clear vision. Regardless, the show doesn’t hook its audience, and it slowly drifts off from the minds of those in its respective community.That’s what I feel happened here with this one. The anime no doubt has passion behind it: all the variations in the music, a wacky premise, twenty-five whole episodes with an entire second season to follow. Yet, be it because of the niche classical motif or the reliance on too random of comedy, however, the anime sadly misses the cut.To clarify, I’m not saying that the anime couldn’t improve in certain areas. It is often repetitive with its jokes and its setups. It tries to be extra loud rather than extra intriguing. It does not create more defined relationships between the cast members. But, if it tweaked the execution here and tried for something different there, I could see this one being more prominent in the eyes of the community rather than barely talked about in almost any capacity.As for myself, while I cannot say the anime entertained me throughout the whole season, I did have fun on occasion. Kanae’s “the pain…” karaoke song in episode eight probably went on for a tad too long, but it still had me smiling. The second half of episode eleven, with Beethes “confession” and the pink “puke,” had me laughing quite a bit. And Schubert’s diss track was, as the kids say, “fire.”All in all, I wouldn’t go so far as to say that I’m sad to see these characters go. However, after being with them for a big chunk of time, and realizing that this writing of mine may very well be the last instance where I ever think about this show (save for my top-anime-from-Winter-2017 list in the coming weeks), I’m left feeling slightly saddened. Saddened by the fact that some anime simply do not stay around for long – and then it’s on to the next story.ClassicaLoid does not earn a standing ovation, but it gives an above average performance nonetheless. Lots of ridiculous comedy, creative visual scenes, weird characters, and diverse Musik. It rises and falls throughout, ending up somewhere in-between (on multiple figarotive levels).SUMMARYStory: Fine, random, crazy comedy pushes everything along, the classical premise is used and contrasted to an appreciable degree, and the uncommon dramatic subplots mean very little in the long runArt & Animation: Good, nifty character designs and interesting Musik spectacles stave off the generally lackluster artistry and actual movementCharacters: Good, Beethes, Motes, and the other reincarnated musical geniuses are goofy and fun, Kanae and Sousuke round out this circus troupe, but everyone requires the whole group to be effectiveMusic & Sound: Good, an awesome OP and a large set of creative “Musik” covers outperform a forgettable OST and the handful of notable VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, while yet another show that will fade from the memories of most in this ever-growing medium, enough fun moments can be found to make the experience worthwhile in one way or anotherFinal Score: 6/10 classics more so than one may initially believe.STORYKanae is a typical high-school girl who happens to be the caretaker of her family’s spacious mansion. A mansion that also houses the so-called ClassicaLoids, reincarnations of extremely famous composers such as Beethoven, Mozart, and so on. However, these now-modern geniuses bring both mischief and craziness through their quirks and their abilities, leaving Kanae, her childhood friend Sousuke, and everyone else to deal with one ClassicaLoid situation after another.As almost exclusively a comedy, ClassicaLoid attempts to tickle its audience’s funny bone not with a feathery quill but rather a conductor’s baton, filling the air with musical romps and lots of other noises. While it has its crescendos, the anime unfortunately has its diminuendos, too.One of the show’s biggest strengths comes through in its weirdness. For it can get very strange. A mother and her son fart in the other’s direction for some bonding time. A merleopon statue takes the form of a censored-out penis. Fried tangerines replace heads and give way to creepy flower monsters. At one point, everyone except Hasshie the bird and Pad-kun the device turns into a fish. Aliens terrorize the Earth until they hear the blissful tones of all Eight Sounds in unison.In other words, ClassicaLoid hits many different spots on the randomized map, going wherever it so desires to achieve laughter.This random nature doesn’t always seem to align with the anime’s goals, however. Liszt’s “girls’ day out” and Beethes worrying about creating the perfect cup of coffee using exactly sixty beans has very little to do with the classical, instrumental, and musical motifs that the anime so regularly follows. Indeed, their Musik applies to pretty much anything, meaning these elements aren’t so much a driving force for the comedy as they are an excuse for the anime to do whatever it wants without regard.That’s being too harsh, though. In fact, ClassicaLoid not strictly sticking with music-centric jokes and funnies is precisely the point of the premise. These ClassicaLoids are the modernized versions of their old-school counterparts. Watching them try to find the correct ingredient for jet-black gyoza or fail to do the simplest of chores makes for a silly contrast that helps with the anime’s comedic angle.Otherwise, the anime does focus on the Musik, providing the audience with one new colorful performance nearly once every episode. Mozart’s “Symphony No. 25 in G Minor – K. 183.” Chopin’s “Nocturne No. 2.” Liszt’s “Liebesträume No. 3.” While they get reused occasionally, the show makes a clear effort to pack in as many of these famous pieces as it can muster.In doing so, more comedy comes forth through the very crux of these compositions. For example, in episode four, Schubert performs “Lullaby” whenever he gets particularly excited, infantilizing those around him. Then, in the very next episode, Beethes performs his “Piano Concerto 5 in E Minor.” It also goes by the title “Emperor Concerto” which, coincidentally enough, summons emperor penguins to do his bidding. And all the way down into episode nineteen, Tchaiko’s “Swan Lake” forces the residents of Kanae’s mansion to romantically pair up so that a bunch of “swans” can whisk them away.Simultaneously, ClassicaLoid has other, smaller jokes to fill the space between everything else. As Beethes plays his “Violin Sonata No. 9” (or “Kreutzer”), Pad-kun dons a Victorian-era wig to match the occasion. Or how, during Sousuke’s torturous “Boku Futsuu,” the eyes on Motes’ eel costume X themselves out as he “dies” from the aural pain. These smaller moments and details keep the comedy going even when the focus lies elsewhere.Beneath the comedy, a looming subplot exists, tying many of the episodes and their events together. It involves Bach, the “evil” ruler of a production company, and his plot for something grander. Unfortunately, it never really gains much focus, it doesn’t affect the characters to any worthwhile degree, and it ultimately doesn’t matter when his device breaks down (twice).ClassicaLoid also includes touchy-feely snippets. Kanae’s grandmother’s influence on her from the first episode brings a twinge of drama. And background scenes, like Kanae’s father saving Beethes and Motes from the facility that created them, offer minute explanations as to how this whole shebang came about. They slightly balance out the heavy amount of comedy and provide a better foundation for the plot, but these elements are either too infrequent or too unimportant to impact the anime, getting in the way of the comedy that ClassicaLoid creates.This combined weak subplot with weaker plot elements isn’t the best means for the show to get across its larger message, but at least it tries for something.Near the end of the season, Bach’s plan of normalizing music isn’t seen as beneficial but rather detrimental. Kanae describes such a musically averaged world as “lonely.” That “special music for special days” is only so because music isn’t everywhere. As her mini flashback depicts, the events her and the other characters went through are dear memories. Memories that, like music, are precious precisely because they represent one’s own experiences.Again, a nice sentiment. But, with the story steeped in ridiculousness, the anime makes it tough to walk away from this story with anything else besides Musik and comedy in mind.ART & ANIMATIONClassicaLoid has a bit of an interesting style thanks to some specific artistic choices.A lot of the intrigue comes from the characters’ designs. They generally stick out from their surroundings due to thick outlines and loud outfits. Quirky colors and classical inspiration further their outspoken looks.For example, Beethes’ has his signature frazzled, white hair, but he wears a black leather jacket, contrasting his colors and highlighting his rocker gusto. Motes goes all pink with a big pillow-like hat and a tied sweater. In comparison, Schubert’s circular frames, mustard coat, and knee-high socks with brown pants hearken back to his era. Liszt’s orange eyes with embroidered-light-green dress, Bach’s disco attire with famous wig, and Chopin’s purple cape and long-silvered clothes continue ClassicaLoid’s nifty trend.Most notably, the Musik performances make a concerted effort to be as involved and as spontaneous and as weird as possible. Mozart will cause machines to literally dance in humanoid fashion. Bąda’s ritualistic sun both hypnotizes her fans and melts Tchaiko alive. Schubert spits fire, turning everyone into living graffiti which in turn pays homage to the classic PaRappa the Rapper video-game series.These segments go wherever they want to, introducing a lot of variety in the visuals. Moreover, they also increase the level of detail, highlighting the importance of the performances. Literal musical notes float through the air. Colors explode. Movement abounds. Entire settings morph. Altogether, these performances are some of the best moments in the show thanks to their involved, fantastical directionIn general, though, ClassicaLoid doesn’t wow too much. The inside of Kanae’s mansion and the brief glimpses of the local city aren’t rife with pizzazz. Actual animation also remains barley passable whenever the characters are neither performing nor going overboard with their actions. Plus, it isn’t ashamed to reuse frames, like during Motes’s Musik performance at the end of episode twenty.Altogether, it’s a toss-up like that of the story. That is, the anime focuses a lot on a couple of specific areas, but many of the surrounding parts do not hold the same level of strength, ultimately reducing its final sense of worth.CHARACTERSClassicaLoid’s comedy only comes about because of the crazy cast of characters that wave their batons throughout the season. As legends of the classical era reincarnated, one would probably expect Beethoven and Mozart and the others to carry an air of power and formality. Instead, they stir up all manner of trouble through their large penchant for wackiness.Beethes cannot get enough of gyoza, a Chinese-inspired Japanese dish that wraps delectable foodstuffs in a doughy, grilled wrapper. More specifically, he can’t get enough of perfecting his gyoza, for Beethes strives for nothing less than mastery of the arts. Thus, he’s overzealous in almost anything he does (with a flamethrower often somewhere nearby). So long as his passions aren’t suppressed and his fate is his to control, he’s a very happy, very loud, and very musical man.Motes cares less about music and more about having a grand old time. He constantly pulls pranks, makes jokes, and creates extra, unnecessary problems for everyone else at the mansion. While he continues to not follow the rules by rolling around through the hallways on his roller-shoes, he still has a kind heart in that none of his actions are designed with malice in mind. Him becoming the local “unidentified monster” to mother a weak fawn demonstrates handily enough that this prankster isn’t so bad after all.Liszt thinks neither about gyoza nor pranks. Instead, she adamantly promotes a single facet of life: love. Thinking about her “little kitten” and watching out for her box-wearing friend, Liszt adores the expression of love in all its sincere, nonsensical forms. As a man-turned-bodacious-babe, she’s arguably the most normal, most mature of the group – but that’s not saying a whole lot.Chopin goes in the complete opposite direction; he cannot tolerate people. A recluse in all but name, he locks himself away in his room, shopping online for new items and playing video games to earn that next piece of rare loot. When he does leave his “cave,” he either hides beneath a box or keeps himself way off in the distance. Alongside his occasional blunt remarks, his generally pessimistic vibe keeps the outgoing personalities around him from overtaking the show outright.Schubert arrives a bit later than the others, but his oddball behavior fits right in. He idolizes Beethes, chasing after and defending the famous musician as much as humanly possible. In contrast, he hates Motes to the core and refuses to accept him as a friend. Schubert also accidentally loses control of his Musik whenever he gets too excited which, in turn, leaves him without much respect among his peers. That is, if they even remember that he is there to begin with.Outside of the main legends, Bach, Tchaiko, and Bąda watch from afar. Bach tends to converse in only musical jargon. Tchaiko flits about in fits of rage. Bąda is the only actual female composer – and, as she is often reminded, the only one-hit wonder of the group. They are the bad-guys-but-not-really of the show, and, while they’re not as prevalent as Beethes and the others, they add their own personality and their own fun into the mix.Despite their origins, none of the characters achieve comedic genius. Plus, their characteristics seem a far cry from their historic selves. Yet the anime incorporates the backgrounds of these real-life composers, often taking some creative liberties to make everything a bit more interesting.For instance, in one episode, Chopin falls for an online avatar named Jolly, connecting back to the light of his life during his original years. Tchaiko’s whole character also counts. Her real name is Pyotr Illyich Tchaikovsky, an old Russian composer. Now an underage girl, the anime plays up her angry attitude, her devotion to Bach, and the fact that she cannot drink alcohol.Certain characters, like Beethes and Motes, do get some more serious exploration of their characters peppered in throughout ClassicaLoid. Beethes contemplates the time when he was deaf, pushing him to achieve greatness. And Motes reels in the pranks and the goofiness to showcase that he can get serious and introspective when he so chooses.Of particular note, Schubert goes through what can only be described as tangible character development. Late into the season, he becomes fed up with how everyone either forgets or does not seem to care about him. In retaliation, he changes his whole persona, ditching the soft, classical approach and adopting instead a set of sick rapping beats.These moments aren’t too impactful, rarely pop up, and honestly don’t matter much when almost everything else seeps with comedy. Liszt not even receiving a specialized episode for herself when almost everyone else gets one argues for this statement well enough. Nevertheless, these slight departures keep the variety going while trying for something new that the anime never had to.The remaining important characters are not ClassicaLoids but humans: Kanae, Sousuke, Mitsuru, and Kyougo.Kanae is the technical main protagonist of this tale, but, understandably, the composers overshadow her presence.

I WILL TELL YOU!the accuracy of this anime is impeccable and i love it so much. im so happy to see a series depicting these historic musicians as the psychotic bastards they were.classicaloid is lacking a bit in story but I think it makes up in comedy, BUT I also think you have to be a specific sort of person to enjoy classicaloids humor. I will now go in depthSTORY- 6The story for this season lacks any meaningful development for a VERY long time. This is because there\'s no real villainy/obstacle, sure you have the evil mega corp Bach...and his underlings but throughout the season he\'s more neutral than anything. If you asked me I couldn\'t name a single REAL threatening thing he did the entire time. With the concept this anime has you would think they would do more with it, but they do not. I mean you have clones of these figures and they don\'t do anything but make fart jokes and never pay their rent. To be fair, the story gets miles better in season 2 but thats not relevant right now. The story in this season just consists of the classicaloids messing around and getting into trouble because their bumbling idiots, while land lord Kanae has constant mental breakdowns after asking her tenants to be productive members of society for the 8th episode.I\'m just going to be a little spoilery so don\'t read if you havent finished but,,I think Beethoven and Mozart shutting down Bach in trying to let EVERYONE have musik was pretty awful. Like why can\'t people have musik? If everyone has musik then everyone can share their experiences with the people around them. Like the thing is Mozart and Beethoven didn\'t shut it down because ""Oh, it might be used for evil."" They shut it down because ""NO! Music is special!!"" Like.. WTF does that even mean?? Yes Music is special so why not share it with others?? It just didn\'t make sense at all and was very selfish of Mozart and Beethoven to do.ART- 9GOOD ART!! The main characters have thick lines that no one else does, their designs greatly contrast those around them, overall the art has miles of personality in it. When they use their musik it does feeling like your eyes are bleeding(depending on who uses it) but the actual musik designs are very great!! I love their transformations and I love how they show the exaggeration of the characters personalities through what their wearing. For example the way they show Liszts femininity and over exaggerate Beethovens passion through his leather jacket, and show Chopins degeneracy through his tracksuit. OR hell its not even an exaggeration sometimes, like they made Bach wear a disco oriented getup when he\'s written maybe like one or two jazzy pieces. The arts just great overall it really suits the characters personalities and makes you question your own state of mind, I love it.SOUND-9AMAZING!!!!!! Okay actually half the tracks are a miss but the other half are genius. The music is usually made by this rock band thats not very good so most of the miss tracks come from them. but they are not all bad. As a show about music most of the music are remixes of classical songs, and wow.. I haven\'t heard such good remixes like how they took the Turkish March and mixed it with Thriller that was brilliant. They absolutely nailed Chopins remixes by using vocaloid, really shows how much of a loser he is!! Whoever did Tchaikos remixes also did them well they are bangers. The Intro theme is really good too, I like how they actually didn\'t use vocals, (Thank god.) and instead used mostly classicaloid instruemnts. It nods to the period the animes actually based on and lets you focus more on the animation in the beginning. Now the missed themes come from Mozart, Beethoven, and Liszt. The voice actors/singers were doing their best but honestly if they had just not done singing their themes would have been just fine. Like wow, I would\'ve given this a 20 if all of Liszts themes DIDNT HAVE SINGING. WHY DID THEY ADD SINGING?? HIS PIANO PIECES DO NOT EVEN INCLUDE SINGING!!!!!!!!!!CHARACTERS-9There is a lack in development and drive to the lives these characters live. And lack of flashbacks for certain characters such as Chopin, Liszt, and others. And I\'m talking about like, little or NO development. All other cast has their moments but even those are short lived, and often times they make their moments more dramatic then needed to be. But that I feel is overshadowed by their gimmicks and eccentric personalities. I just love things that are ridiculous and their characters are so ridiculous enough that the lack of flashbacks Isn\'t a deal breaker for me. I enjoy the clones of these figures making a name for themselves, because after all these ARENT the real composers their just clones.I wish they expanded more on that, it would\'ve been nice if the characters thought more about what it meant just being clones.But anyway wow the characters, absolute maniacs. It really shows how undignified most composers were in their personal lives and this show makes them human by showing us that. Of course Schubert and a couple other characters aren\'t exactly accurate, but Liszt, Chopin, Mozart, and Beethoven are wildly similar to their real life counterparts. Mozart will always be insane.But anyway, Bach had a good character and I think he was a good Neutral Villian. I think this show needed a stronger Villian character, but Bach in general had a nice motivation for doing what he wanted to do. Tchaiko and Bada being paired together against their will I think was very funny, and good for contrast of character.ENJOYMENT-10This is gonna be my favorite anime for a while just because of how entertaining it is. Like the gags do get repetitive sometimes but when you finish the anime it really becomes nostalgic. This isn\'t the anime to watch if your looking for meaningful story, but it is the anime to watch if your looking for laughs and the memory to look back on it and be like.. Yeah, that was pretty ridiculous. I\'ve rewatched it like twice.Overall I give it a 10 just because I think this anime deserves a better score. My real rating would be an 8. But anyway, this really does pander to a small group of people. If you think of composers to be dignified people who were very formal your not going to like this anime. If you wanted MALE anime Liszt, you are NOT going to like this anime but I suggest you stick around for season 2 to see him for 2 minutes. Just lower your expectations before watching.. Please.This isn\'t a really general public anime, but you can still enjoy it without know thing references!! It\'s funny either way. and his underlings but throughout the season he\'s more neutral than anything. If you asked me I couldn\'t name a single REAL threatening thing he did the entire time. With the concept this anime has you would think they would do more with it, but they do not. I mean you have clones of these figures and they don\'t do anything but make fart jokes and never pay their rent. To be fair, the story gets miles better in season 2 but thats not relevant right now. The story in this season just consists of the classicaloids messing around and getting into trouble because their bumbling idiots, while land lord Kanae has constant mental breakdowns after asking her tenants to be productive members of society for the 8th episode.I\'m just going to be a little spoilery so don\'t read if you havent finished but,,I think Beethoven and Mozart shutting down Bach in trying to let EVERYONE have musik was pretty awful. Like why can\'t people have musik? If everyone has musik then everyone can share their experiences with the people around them. Like the thing is Mozart and Beethoven didn\'t shut it down because ""Oh, it might be used for evil."" They shut it down because ""NO! Music is special!!"" Like.. WTF does that even mean?? Yes Music is special so why not share it with others?? It just didn\'t make sense at all and was very selfish of Mozart and Beethoven to do.ART- 9GOOD ART!! The main characters have thick lines that no one else does, their designs greatly contrast those around them, overall the art has miles of personality in it. When they use their musik it does feeling like your eyes are bleeding(depending on who uses it) but the actual musik designs are very great!! I love their transformations and I love how they show the exaggeration of the characters personalities through what their wearing. For example the way they show Liszts femininity and over exaggerate Beethovens passion through his leather jacket, and show Chopins degeneracy through his tracksuit. OR hell its not even an exaggeration sometimes, like they made Bach wear a disco oriented getup when he\'s written maybe like one or two jazzy pieces. The arts just great overall it really suits the characters personalities and makes you question your own state of mind, I love it.SOUND-9AMAZING!!!!!! Okay actually half the tracks are a miss but the other half are genius. The music is usually made by this rock band thats not very good so most of the miss tracks come from them. but they are not all bad. As a show about music most of the music are remixes of classical songs, and wow.. I haven\'t heard such good remixes like how they took the Turkish March and mixed it with Thriller that was brilliant. They absolutely nailed Chopins remixes by using vocaloid, really shows how much of a loser he is!! Whoever did Tchaikos remixes also did them well they are bangers. The Intro theme is really good too, I like how they actually didn\'t use vocals, (Thank god.) and instead used mostly classicaloid instruemnts. It nods to the period the animes actually based on and lets you focus more on the animation in the beginning. Now the missed themes come from Mozart, Beethoven, and Liszt. The voice actors/singers were doing their best but honestly if they had just not done singing their themes would have been just fine. Like wow, I would\'ve given this a 20 if all of Liszts themes DIDNT HAVE SINGING. WHY DID THEY ADD SINGING?? HIS PIANO PIECES DO NOT EVEN INCLUDE SINGING!!!!!!!!!!CHARACTERS-9There is a lack in development and drive to the lives these characters live. And lack of flashbacks for certain characters such as Chopin, Liszt, and others. And I\'m talking about like, little or NO development. All other cast has their moments but even those are short lived, and often times they make their moments more dramatic then needed to be. But that I feel is overshadowed by their gimmicks and eccentric personalities. I just love things that are ridiculous and their characters are so ridiculous enough that the lack of flashbacks Isn\'t a deal breaker for me. I enjoy the clones of these figures making a name for themselves, because after all these ARENT the real composers their just clones.I wish they expanded more on that, it would\'ve been nice if the characters thought more about what it meant just being clones.But anyway wow the characters, absolute maniacs. It really shows how undignified most composers were in their personal lives and this show makes them human by showing us that. Of course Schubert and a couple other characters aren\'t exactly accurate, but Liszt, Chopin, Mozart, and Beethoven are wildly similar to their real life counterparts. Mozart will always be insane.But anyway, Bach had a good character and I think he was a good Neutral Villian. I think this show needed a stronger Villian character, but Bach in general had a nice motivation for doing what he wanted to do. Tchaiko and Bada being paired together against their will I think was very funny, and good for contrast of character.ENJOYMENT-10This is gonna be my favorite anime for a while just because of how entertaining it is. Like the gags do get repetitive sometimes but when you finish the anime it really becomes nostalgic. This isn\'t the anime to watch if your looking for meaningful story, but it is the anime to watch if your looking for laughs and the memory to look back on it and be like.. Yeah, that was pretty ridiculous. I\'ve rewatched it like twice.Overall I give it a 10 just because I think this anime deserves a better score. My real rating would be an 8. But anyway, this really does pander to a small group of people. If you think of composers to be dignified people who were very formal your not going to like this anime. If you wanted MALE anime Liszt, you are NOT going to like this anime but I suggest you stick around for season 2 to see him for 2 minutes. Just lower your expectations before watching.. Please.This isn\'t a really general public anime, but you can still enjoy it without know thing references!! It\'s funny either way.']"

(2015)First off, I see a few low scores on the basis of it being a bathhouse special. Let us be clear unless you have that attitude to every single show that does this then the opinion is invalid as it will depend on the order of shows it became boring for you. If this was your first it would be amazing surely in comparison to ones you haven't seen.The OVA is literally episode 13 which comes to why I wished the episodes were longer or had more episodes in the season so that this could have been with the...main series.As you would expect male and females are separate. The 4 girls do some lewd things very mildly and the male has a fantasy.Ends with Yayoi and the brother Haruki having a comedic gaff as with their normal scenario that doesn't go as planned for him and leaves on a funny yet light note with the other sister's reaction.The art is the exact same standard as before.The sound is good too, the ED is fun still.Characters are generic as they are the same:Brother = Simp.Older sister = Cool in public, lazy at home.Middle sister = Brocon but tsundere.Twins = non-identical, one shy and one active but love pranks.In the end, another fun episode that leaves the show on a high.Shame it didn't continue.7/10 main series.As you would expect male and females are separate.

"Dragon, Ie wo Kau.",https://myanimelist.net/anime/40526/Dragon_Ie_wo_Kau,"['For a show of a subversive fantasy gag parody like this, you would think that with such a mediocre-to-decent story about a cheap dragon going house-hunting, would be very lame and off-putting. While most of the community thinks that\'s the case with this show, I, however for one, was so wrong, and as time progresses, out of the many great and masterpiece shows of the Spring 2021 season, other than the overlooked Odd Taxi, ""Dragon, Ie wo Kau."" is easily the 2nd best show that I always look forward to for weekly seasonals. I\'m very salty about the undeserving low score, but whatever, this show\'s...sadly not for everyone.As the title goes, it\'s literally ""Dragon Goes House-Hunting"", and to create more ""magical"" moments for a trivia, one of this show\'s sponsors is actually a real-life company by the name of ""OPEN HOUSE Co. Ltd"", which engages in the real-estate agency and brokerage business in Japan. It operates through the following segments: Single-Family Homes Related Business, Condominiums, Property Resales, and Others. It\'s methodically analytical to think that a real-life real estate Japanese company would promote their services alongside mangaka Kawo Tanuki\'s work, and in this case, what the anime portrayed throughout its run of different house-hunting procedures, the company OPEN HOUSE also does the exact same business, and this is especially relatable to both native Japanese and Gaijins (foreigners) whom are like this dragon who\'s constantly searching for home in all nook and cranny areas possible.I know that a lot of people are turned off by the MC dragon Letty\'s casted VA Shun Horie, but you\'ve gotta remember that he didn\'t exactly have good roles to begin with on his VA business. His most recent MC roles being Kazuya from ""Kanojo, Okarishimasu"" and Hacker from ""Akudama Drive"", it\'s easy to hear why his voice sounded very different from other more pronounced VAs like Yuki Kaji a.k.a KajiKaji. Nevertheless, I\'d feel that Shun Horie provided a very unique child-like voice to Letty, being the kid dragon of a family that disowns him because he\'s being very timid and careless about his life to the point that it\'s un-dragon-like, and that\'s just the tip of the iceberg. If you look at his personal card, you\'ll see that his stats are far from ideal, the worst being that he has his LUK stat in the negative (like when was there ever such points being pwned). Thankfully, Letty gets a huge help when he encounters an elf realtor by the name of Dearia, supposedly a faux Demon Lord with his name stretching far and wide across the fantasy land, and there\'s no one whom have never heard of this good-looking Ikemen realtor before. Together with this unassuming ""powerful"" elf, the timid dragon Letty starts his journey to search for his perfect home.Other than the stereotypical heroes whom surface up time and time again to stop Letty and Dearia in their tracks (because Letty is a dragon, and red ones spew fire), it\'s literally gag moments one after another with the unassuming Dearia having to protect Letty\'s backside every now and then. But sometimes on occasion, Dearia requests that Letty does his own protection, because he is a dragon, and he should be able to spew fire, however, due to Letty\'s timidness, he has to constantly hide behind Dearia\'s back, which sometimes give him a headache, much less the specifics of different houses and features that would cater best to his long-time client. Nevertheless, the other main characters that would soon pop up in both elf and dragon\'s life with Piyovelt a.k.a Pip the Hraesvelgr Norse mythology bird (who calls Letty his dad) and the stuck-up child that is Princess Nell (whom like Letty, wants to find a home for herself and away from royalty), they provide extra hilarity and bantering that is worth every bit of that comedy gold. And adding onto that effect with the RPG-like symoblisms and references, this show\'s straightforward-ness is one that is enduring the toleration on the boring side, but also best enjoyed in a slice-of-life-ish relaxing scale.Most of the production team working on this show do have some experience, but it seems as though that the way with Youkoso Japari Park director Haruki Kasugamori\'s direction, this show produced at Signal.MD is average at best. I\'m not asking for like A-1 Pictures levels of production, just a well decent one that wouldn\'t sacrifice quality for quantity, and sadly this show just looks abstractly drab with many cutting corners. I get that Haruki Kasugamori is trying to make this show look like something that\'s made for kids, but this is anime, and the stark contrast is huge for the general population. Sure, the manga is well adapted, but if there was a choice, I would stick to the manga while hearing voice recordings of VAs, that would be a good compromise.What\'s a total surpise is that one of the most famous J-Pop artists, Masayoshi Ooishi, performed the OP, which looking at the MV on YouTube, is also aimed at kids. It\'s to be expected of a song quality that is like SSSS.Dynazenon\'s one that fits well into Masayoshi Ooishi\'s repertoire, but this one is totally out of left field, and not to mention that every song produced by this reputable music artist is catchy great. Non Stop Rabbit\'s ED has gotta be one of my favourite EDs of the season, being a medieval rock song that doesn\'t stray away from the fantasy realms. Seriously though, this OST is IMO top-notch.At the end of the day, with such a simple story and lackluster anmiation, this show should have been doomed from the get-go. Thankfully, with its endearing character cast and gag comedy, it changed the game with its nonchalant characters that showcase ""hummingbirds knocking into wood"" levels of comedic banter, so much so that I can\'t stop having my funny bones being triggered every now and then.Let this be a PSA: Even if this show will never get a Season 2, if you like some fantasy escapism, I highly implore you to give this show a second chance. I know I did from the get-go, embrace it wholeheartedly, and came out with a smile on my face.

This series needs more love than the hate that it got.', 'Dragon, Ie wo Kau stands apart from most other anime in that it offers a lighthearted and amusing comedy of errors with unique and intelligent quirks.Making the Heroes the bad guys and the ""Monsters"" just average beings wanting to live and let live is a novel take on the fantasy genre.An un-Dragon Dragon may have thrown people off, but I love this twist.The only downside for me was they could have done a lot more with Letty\'s character development.  From Runt to Alpha Dragon would be an incredible counterpoint to the effervescence of the plot.But from the intro to the credits, the series...puts on an uplifting and whimsical play that you can\'t help but laugh and smile and grin at.

And it needs more love than it is getting..There are a lot of good series this season (Fumetsu no Anata e, Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song, Boku no Hero season 5 etc) but for me the best series of this season hands down is Dragon, Ie wu Kau. I enjoy quite many series this season, but this is the only series I am looking forward whole week. In a time we are leaving with Corona virus, travel restrictions and so on, this series manages to wash away all my worries and...truly lighten up my day. It doesn't have amazing artstyle nor thought proving and deep storyline, but what it has is endless ammounts of heart and fun and that's what is needed in this hard and dark time. I love the characters and I love the comedy that rises out of those characters doing seemingly mundane things. I guessed before this season had started, that I would drop this series after seeing episode 1 (like I did with f.e 86 or Slime Taoshite 300-nen), but now I enjoy this series whole heartedly.I gave 5 to the Story, 6 to the Art(style) and 6 to the Sound. Mainly beacause it is obvious that they are fairly avarage or for some even below avarage.But I rated 10 out of 10 characters of this series and my own enjoyment that I get out of this series.

It doesn't matter for me if the art style has a suplime quality, when series overall doesn't give much enjoyment and watching it feels like a slugfest.

It fits the criteria perfectly. Letty, is a ""good"" dragon. Actually, a sniveling, cowardly dragon incapable of violence, who got kicked out of his home after a hunter stole a dragon egg right out from under his sleeping nose. On his own for the first time, the naive, kind dragon is quickly taken advantage of by dwarves, heroes and other races in the world, many of whom just want to dissect and kill him for ""rare materials"".It is only by good...fortune that he meets Dearia, an elf architect who happens to be The Dark Lord, and they venture off together to find Letty a good home. Their adventures are surprisingly hilarious, and the characters are for the most part likeable. The writers have done a good job parodying the normal fantasy tropes, with the episode featuring the Gladiator Dungeon being my favorite so far. Plenty of laughs to be had in this series, which I would consider comedy fantasy.This series has one of the cutest non talking Mascots ever. The protection and adoption of Pip, Letty\'s ""son"" is also very heartwarming. This is a show an adult could easily watch with a child without fear of the kid crying from excessive violence or sex. PG anime! There are several surprisingly adult themes included which I would hope are subtle enough not to traumatize children but which adults will ""get"" and laugh at. In a way this reminded me a lot of Shrek.The downsides are serious though. The design of the Letty dragon is not good. It\'s clunky and awkward - a creature with that kind of design would not be anatomically capable of moving like Letty does. The fore arms are too long and the hind end doesn\'t move ""right"". It\'s like they spent all the budget making Dearia delicious, Pip cute and left not much for Letty, the main character. This is particularly disappointing because the Black Dragon is VERY well animated and looks real.After finishing the series I can\'t rate this anime better than fair. It\'s a cute, charming watch, sprinkled with life lessons and humor. With better sound and animation this could easily have had a better rating. This being said, I will happily watch a season 2, hopefully done by a studio that has better animation. fortune that he meets Dearia, an elf architect who happens to be The Dark Lord, and they venture off together to find Letty a good home.

It was kind of funny at the start, and I liked the concepts on paper. Monsters being not so bad, telling the story from their perspective, and something like looking for a house in another world where fantastical locations could be explored! But it felt like after they went to the spooky mansion and the whale, they ran out of ideas. Then there\'s also the issue of a bunch of this anime being dedicated to stuff like paying taxes. If there\'s an audience for that, it certainly isn\'t me.Sure, Letty is...cute at times, but as the series goes on he doesn\'t develop at all. It becomes pretty frustrating. When he started protecting the egg I expected him to eventually improve himself to protect someone he cared about, but the egg ended up being nothing more than an excuse to add a cute mascot character to the cast. I wanted to see him learn the skills he never learned with his parents, such as fire or flight, but that never happens. It makes Letty seem really whiny when he doesn\'t have any growth, but the jokes at his expense also start to feel repetitive at this point. We get it, he\'s a dragon who\'s also a weakling.In fact, the message of this anime falls flat in the end. ""Every being has good and evil"" and yet certain races such as the dwarves (and 99.9% of the time humans) are just pure evil and want nothing more than to butcher Letty for his valuable dragon parts. Everything about this anime unfortunately just started to repeat itself after about 5 episodes that it was very hard to watch through all of it.

It’s wholesome, cute, funny, relaxing, and Dearia’s hot. The op is stunning, and the ed as well!

I didn’t really expect much when I first started watching, but now I wait in anticipation for the new episode each week :)I have to commend the animators for not using cgi on Letty’s design, and for just the pretty art in general. The characters aren’t boring either, there’s backstories to go along with them, and cool...personalities too! A nice variety of cute, cool, dumb and funny characters.This is the kind of anime I’d watch to forget about any kind of irl stress, it’s amazing!

It gets extra bonus points because my favorite seiyuu are in the main cast.The story is simple, with the first few episodes showcasing different fantasy settings as possible home options for Letty. It breaks away once in a while to introduce the other characters and their backstories. Dearia's backstory is definitely the thing to look forward to the most.I guess the downside of...such a story is that there really isn't a drive to finish such an open plot. It's a series that could go for as long as 5 seasons if it wanted to. Also, one of the characters that was advertised came in very late that it almost felt more appropriate to have an extra season to show case more time with them. The 12 episodes did wrap up very nicely though, so I can't complain too much.Also, as much as I like dragons and I love Letty, his anatomy is really weird. Which is not really the anime's fault per say, given that it was adapted from a manga, but I think it's still a minor complaint to bring up.

At you, the MAL community.Not all anime are made equal.Some tell epic tales of adventure and heroism. Some tell a touching story that leaves your heart a crushed mess. Some make you laugh and holler like a moron. Many attempt some of the previously mentioned and fail epicly, leaving only a bitter aftertaste.This isn't one of those anime.

I laughed a lot. Unfortunately, that didn\'t really translate to my enjoyment of the show itself. Sometimes, good jokes or references just aren\'t enough to hold up a whole season of a show. Hopefully, if a second season comes out (or if there\'s already one I haven\'t noticed yet), then there\'s a bit more foundation to it.---Starting with Cons---While I liked the idea, it really irked me that Letty didn\'t ever change even a little until about the last ten minutes of the season. I am not a person who...thinks every character needs a major arc or anything like that; I just think that, rather naturally, a person even with Letty\'s personality would at least become partially more used to the people around him, the situations he tends to literally always get into, or the environments through which he travels. I enjoyed the end specifically for this, however it was too little and too late. If there is ever a second season, I hope they focus a bit of effort into giving Letty some character development. Even slight development over the course of a season would be enough; I just don\'t like completely one-dimensional characters. Until that slight change at the end of the last episode, though, I never saw even the slightest change to him. In the episode when he\'s trying to protect the egg, he seems like he\'s gonna actually maybe change a bit or grow a bit as a character, but he regresses almost immediately after that episode. The last episode\'s last 10 minutes contain the only real change I\'ve seen. Just a little step in growth, and really, that\'s all I wanted to see, here or there, throughout the show. I think Letty, the protagonist, was the very reason I couldn\'t rate the show very well.The other main thing that bugged me is something that has always put me off from specific anime other people consider worth the watch. I don\'t like shows that constantly depend on ""unlucky character who can\'t handle themselves just got into bad situation and doesn\'t know what to do"". Here and there, I get it; played for a laugh or two sometimes, I get it. Every single episode, though, makes it hard to get into. Hell, even when he\'s dropped into a situation that\'s fine at first, it\'s still often treated the same. It becomes boring and repetitive, which is why I focused so much on the characters rather than story (and found them lacking as well). Honestly, I enjoyed a lot of the side characters that only popped up once or twice more than I did the protagonist. If you\'re going to depend on a nearly formulaic approach to every story in an episodic series, there have to be things that make each episode different either character-wise or plot-wise. While the show overall isn\'t bad, I mainly only kept watching it because I was hoping to see some kind of progression, which only slightly appeared at the tail-end.Any other cons for me are minor. Things like the following don\'t really need more than a sentence or two.-Character design for Letty felt like it was constantly switching between two or three different variants even just between normal scene or position changes. It felt inconsistent.-Honestly, the little bit of backstory we got for Dearia was interesting, and his story probably could have made a better show, or at least a good side story.-The show feels like it\'s filled with Deus ex Machina. Often, Dearia only finally appears to REALLY help once there is no other possible avenue of rescue, making payoffs feel cheap.---And now the Pros---So, mostly, the show is a pretty casual watch. If you don\'t have a huge problem with sympathetic awkwardness or embarrassment, then you probably won\'t mind Letty\'s character. The anime, in that case, is a very chill experience, and could be nice to relax with or joke about. While I won\'t say the show makes great use of satire or parody, it does often make funny jokes about modern anime or game tropes. One of the main reasons I ever tried the show out was because I saw a gif of the joke about people building homes out of blocks.As for the sound design, it\'s decent as well. No complaints, and it often fits the situations well.Side characters are probably the most fun I had watching this anime. While that is kind of throwing shade on the main cast, I enjoyed the background characters a lot. The gnomes were a cute and funny addition, and the non-human characters we often see really did tend to rouse my interest. I liked how this show portrayed a lot of fantasy races we often think of as only the bad guys or the hostile monsters. A lot of the characters we only see once or twice actually make me interested in the world and it\'s worldbuilding because I can\'t tell if it\'s very shallow or very well-done and subtle. The show doesn\'t always just focus on Western fantasy creatures or Eastern mythical creatures, either; it often shows a good set of both. I was especially happy to see a sphinx in there, as (other than some of the Ancient Egyptian deities themselves) Egyptian mythical creatures are so poorly represented in a lot of fantasy. Anyway, a little bit of a con for the main cast, but a big pro for the sideliners.---TLDR---The anime isn\'t bad per se, but I can\'t say it\'s great, either. I think a lot of poor choices were made that make it feel boring and bland, despite hints here and there that there were probably a lot of good ideas behind the scenes. Whether that means that some good writers were sidelined, or that a lot of good ideas just weren\'t executed well, I could not rightly say. If you don\'t have problems watching characters in awkward or embarrassing situations, and you don\'t mind a lack of any real arcs or story, then this is a fine watch. Very chill and very easy to just sit down, watch, and zone out with. If you\'re looking for something interesting or character-driven, or even plot-driven, though, you probably don\'t want to watch this one.Overall, I\'d give it about a 5.5/10 if there were decimals. Points for the good ideas nestled in there, but fully outweighed by poor execution. thinks every character needs a major arc or anything like that; I just think that, rather naturally, a person even with Letty\'s personality would at least become partially more used to the people around him, the situations he tends to literally always get into, or the environments through which he travels. I enjoyed the end specifically for this, however it was too little and too late. If there is ever a second season, I hope they focus a bit of effort into giving Letty some character development. Even slight development over the course of a season would be enough; I just don\'t like completely one-dimensional characters. Until that slight change at the end of the last episode, though, I never saw even the slightest change to him. In the episode when he\'s trying to protect the egg, he seems like he\'s gonna actually maybe change a bit or grow a bit as a character, but he regresses almost immediately after that episode. The last episode\'s last 10 minutes contain the only real change I\'ve seen. Just a little step in growth, and really, that\'s all I wanted to see, here or there, throughout the show. I think Letty, the protagonist, was the very reason I couldn\'t rate the show very well.The other main thing that bugged me is something that has always put me off from specific anime other people consider worth the watch. I don\'t like shows that constantly depend on ""unlucky character who can\'t handle themselves just got into bad situation and doesn\'t know what to do"". Here and there, I get it; played for a laugh or two sometimes, I get it. Every single episode, though, makes it hard to get into. Hell, even when he\'s dropped into a situation that\'s fine at first, it\'s still often treated the same. It becomes boring and repetitive, which is why I focused so much on the characters rather than story (and found them lacking as well). Honestly, I enjoyed a lot of the side characters that only popped up once or twice more than I did the protagonist. If you\'re going to depend on a nearly formulaic approach to every story in an episodic series, there have to be things that make each episode different either character-wise or plot-wise.

That\'s a first.Its supposed to be a comedy, and it relies on the usual stuff (contrasting situations, surprise twits, etc) to get laughs. On that front, it\'s extremely average.The true shining point of this anime is the realism they bring into it. It\'s about a dragon in a fantasy world full of fantasy creatures but so many practical matters! You\'ve got a real estate agent, different types of homes, loans deposits, the \'rent or buy"" argument, family homes, bachelor homes, and work with lie-in accommodation, and taxes. TAXES!!!!...Can it get more real than that???Also, Dearia is HOT. From looks to poise to manners, that man is a sight for sore eyes. The contrast between Dearia and Letty was hilarious.Look, it\'s no masterpiece, and there are probably better anime to watch. But if you want something lighthearted and fun, give this one a shot!

But if you want something lighthearted and fun, give this one a shot!', 'Hey, if some people can rate that infamous Healer series 10/10, why can\'t I with Dragon\'s House Hunting? Yes, I\'m aware that the parody\'s concept has been done before with another airing under this spring season. What you need to know is that it all comes down to proper execution that\'ll be the factor in rating one\'s enjoyment throughout the series\' runtime.I admit I\'m sad this series has a very low score for not everyone can enjoy the ""logical humor"" being referenced in this series; But! It\'s the most enjoyable series I\'ve experienced during this seasonal watch. Sure its premise is simple with our Dragon...MC finding a permanent home for himself with the help of a handsome Elf who\'s the most capable estate agent, but I love how they keep the wholesome, if not laid-back tone and the way they utilise the Hero Party characters be the villains as this story is told from a monster\'s POV in which our Dragon MC is one.I\'m still surprised that those who admit love watching wholesome series rate DHH a very low rating; I saw most of them are fans of CGDCT unless they\'re blind that Nell, the bratty but likeable princess, is considered to be that type of character. Nevertheless, I\'m glad DHH still focus most of the episodes on the house-hunting concept in a high fantasy setting that may have been the factor in showcasing the RPG fantasy tropes being ridiculed in a genuine, funny way.I\'m not easy to please so I got myself surprised looking forward to watch weekly episodes. The characters may be consistent that didn\'t need a character development, with the exception of the Elf whose backstory is simple but still interestingly cute for he was a little bit bratty like Nell is. I\'m also liking the Hunter & his Cat becoming breakout characters in my eyes that I wished they appear more if a season renewal is possible.In short, I recommend Dragon\'s House Hunting if you want a wholesome series that\'s set in a (high) fantasy world. If that\'s the case, you don\'t need to have any suspension of disbelief to enjoy it because of the world has only RPG fantasy setting so you won\'t feel grating/jarring while watching it. The characters have consistent personality but that\'s okay because this is supposed to be a comical and relaxing watch though it depends how you\'re feeling towards meant-to-be likeable characters like our Dragon MC.The character designs, background arts, & animation quality are satisfying that I\'m glad it\'s guaranteed you\'ll be able to enjoy Dragon\'s House Hunting with great visuals that helps the simple premise & storytelling be more enjoyable when you least expected. For now, this is one of those ""read the manga"" method, but I guarantee this anime adaptation has managed to promote the manga with great care & effort. Yes, go purchase the manga series if you want more wholesome moments of your fave main characters going on House-Hunting Adventures.

The show was nothing extravagant, it didn't break your heart with emotions, it didn't make you gasp with thrill, and it was no action packed movie. That being said, there was one thing to me that this show excelled at, and that was making me laugh. (This review will have a little amount of spoilers)Story - 7/10: There was nothing crazy about the story, but that's what made the show nice. The story goes about with our MC, Letty, joining alongside the Demon...Lord and Realtor, Daeria, in a search for the perfect house for a Red Dragon. The story sounds odd, but I have to give props to Studio.MD, because a show I expected to drop the ball, ended up being hilarious. One thing I also want to applaud MD for is how well they did the Fantasy/RPG setting. Making the show essentially a real life Fantasy RPG where everyone has stats, there's hidden treasures, etc. That was an awesome addition to the show. There were some cliffhangers and things that could make you intrigued in the next episode, which lead to some fun anticipation, but nothing made you stressed like you had to be worried about what would happen next.Art - 7/10: Although the art and animation was pretty, and, in a lot of ways, adorable, it isn't anything crazy or epic. That being said, it's nothing to scoff at or look down upon either.Sound - 6/10: Same as the art, nothing crazy, but not bad either. I genuinely enjoyed the OP and ED, the OST however wasn't very memorable.Characters - 6/10: The characters in this show are kind of a toss up. On one hand I enjoyed them all due to their humor and how cute some of them were. All the characters had their positives about them, and they were all funny. On the other hand, every character had their negative points. Letty wasn't very strong and in the beginning cried too much, which put him in a lot of bad spots. Daeria was almost too oblivious, which was odd for a character as smart as him. On top of this there is little to no character development by the end, everyone is as they started which is disappointing especially in Letty's case. I do want to add though that the amount of mythical and fantasy creatures they added to the show was an awesome feature. Something that flies well under the radar.Enjoyment - 8/10: I looked forward to this show every week, more than some of my other shows of the season. Dragon, Ie wo Kau brought nonstop laughs and a never ending smile to my face. Although it wasn't my favorite show of the spring season, it was definitely up there.Overall - 7/10: My final thoughts, this show surprised me in a good way, I didn't expect to finish this show and rate it as high as I have. An awesome lovable show that brought lots of laughs and smiles. If you're looking for a more comedic and fun fantasy show that isn't overly action packed or emotional, this anime is a wonderful choice.

Far from it.I had high hopes after the first few episodes that this would be a cute and funny show to relax go.  Sadly, it lost its own premise halfway through, and never quite found its way back...Art - Pretty solid. 7/10Story - It meanders all over the place and never fully settles on what it wants to do. 4/10Characters - A nice departure from expectations overall, and I enjoyed how it played on various tropes.  There isn't much character development, but they are likeable and charming. 7/10Overall I enjoyed the earlier episodes (where actual househunting was taking place)...but started to lose interest when they started doing backstory episodes for irrelevant things.  If this gets a season two, I hope it is much more focused and plays with the comedy which is where this show really shined. but started to lose interest when they started doing backstory episodes for irrelevant things.

Came on this anime with low expectations and after finishing it realized that those expectations were high.

Fire Tripper,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2973/Fire_Tripper,"[""Well this was interesting.Fire Tripper. A 50 minute OVA by Rumiko Takahashi telling the story of a girl who somehow finds herself traveling through time to the Civil War era where she meets a high strung young man and she has to find out how she got there and what the story is, etc, etc. Sound familiar? Somehow this gem made it under the radar of even Inuyasha fans who pass it off as a rip-off of their favorite half-demon. Which is not only impossible, but a shame as this OVA is definitely worth the watch.The story was set and concrete. There were...no interruptions, no random visits to the beach with the 'gang'. The OVA moves forward and tells the story, and a great story at that. It's a bit hard to really get into without spoilers, but the story is not overly complicated. Anyone could easily figure it out just by looking at the synopsis and picture. Everything unravels nicely, and there were some very clever foreshadowing hints throughout the beginning. They're a bit hard to spot on your first watch, but it's fun to look out for them and then compare with the ending. One thing that Inuyasha can't compare with is that this story had a beginning and a solid ending. As much as I would love to see more of these characters, the end was very satisfying.The characters were like a breath of fresh air. Suzuko, while a little annoying at first, was really very mature and I liked her as a character. Unlike a lot of characters who find themselves in a strange new world, she adapted well and the only major whining to be heard from her was justified. Shukumaru was an idiot. Gosh I loved him. He had a temper and was rough around the edges, but from the looks of it he seemed to be the most trustworthy guy in that village. Their relationship was natural and even with such a short time frame it never felt forced. Most of the character development was all Suzuko, but again it was gradual.The art wasn't the best. For its age of course it's pretty darn good and it holds that classic Takahashi style that fans of Ranma 1/2 or Urusei Yatsura would be familiar with. Newer anime fans might be a bit thrown off because the show does show its age a bit, but it wasn't exactly a tragedy. It's never a distraction and some scenes are even quite beautiful.It's probably true that this story inspired the series Inuyasha that people know today. Had this been a full length series and not a 50 minute OVA, I would without a doubt say this surpasses Inuyasha in every way. I still want to say that, just for the fact that it has a solid ending and an enjoyable story. Just for its short length and history alone I would recommend anyone giving this OVA a try. Fire Tripper has the feeling of watching a good movie, and is ideal for Inuyasha fans, Rumiko Takahashi fans, or just someone looking for something short but sweet. no interruptions, no random visits to the beach with the 'gang'.

Of course it is made by Rumiko Takashi the maker of Inu Yasha so it is not a far stretch to believe she borrowed elements as she has done in the past and currently does.The story is all within this one episode and it feels very fast paced. In the amount of time used it actually creates a fairly interesting plot with a good ending with a rather enjoyable surprise. I think they...did good with the story over all and maybe had the ova been 30 minutes longer or two episodes they may have been able to resolve any pacing issues.It feels like a short story in that you understand everything cause its laid out openly but its short,sweet and to the point.The characters are hard to identify with or grow attached to in such a short amount of time but that does not mean they are bad characters. Revolving around only the two main characters you do get a decent understanding of there feelings even if you don't have enough time and content to attach yourself to them personally. The characters do whats intend effectively and you can appreciate the simplicity of it all.The Art and Audio are very early 80s and make me personally feel nostalgic of a lot of Rumic Works. I have no complaints about either department as they both look and sound perfectly fine for the time it was made and the budget and length of the project itself. I actually like the male leads character design and his color pallet. The main leads both resemble characters from Inu Yasha a great deal.Overall i really enjoyed this Ova in particular over the other Rumic Ovas, it was just enjoyable. I felt interested the whole time and i wanted to see the conclusion as it built. Being a big fan of older anime i recommend this to anyone who likes classic.

I\'m definitely biased in my liking of this anime, but hey, you can give it a shot too.(this is a rewritten review of a previous one)There may be spoilers ahead--(but does it really matter? It\'s literally only fifty minutes long)L;DR:  Where do I begin?In my quest to consume as much Rumiko Takahashi media as possible, I stumbled onto Fire Tripper. The synopsis peaked my interest, and after finding a low resolution, muddled audio version of it on YouTube I thought, heck, why not.With an interest in vintage OVAs anyway (you know,...Cipher the video, Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou, and so on) I thought that what was pitched to me as an ""80s Inuyasha"" would be right up my metaphorical alley. And to that extent... it was. As of writing this I\'ve rewatched this OVA a whopping four times. But is it because it\'s a good OVA? No... not really...First of all, it\'s time-travel-historical-japan-isekai. I eat up that kind of stuff the same way I do dinosaur chicken nuggets. It\'s a genre that\'s a definite guilty pleasure of mine. Plotwise, we follow a high school girl who\'s name I\'ve genuinely forgotten get involved in a gas explosion that teleports her into the past. There, she meets a guy, and typical Takahashi antics ensue.You can definitely see some of the foundations of Inuyasha, but there were more than enough differences for me to separate the two in my mind. The story is rather interesting itself, as it combines a sense of mystery with a tiny bit of action, a large dose of romance, and just a smidge of ~incest.~Wait, incest?No, don\'t worry, we can pull out the ""no chromo"" card here since there is no technical incest in this OVA! Hooray! Still, that did make for a very awkward couple of minutes in the middle of the runtime. Well, whatever, I\'ll take what I can get. (If you watch this OVA you will see what I mean).Setting aside that factor, the romance is weirdly kind of cute in that 80s-Takahashi-way, and I was genuinely intrigued. And since there wasn\'t too much going on plotwise in the first place, most things get wrapped up by the end of the OVA in a satisfying way, leaving me content at the end of my viewing.So what\'s the rundown? Do I recommend Fire Tripper? Eh, sure, why not. Cipher the video, Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou, and so on) I thought that what was pitched to me as an ""80s Inuyasha"" would be right up my metaphorical alley. And to that extent... it was. As of writing this I\'ve rewatched this OVA a whopping four times. But is it because it\'s a good OVA? No... not really...First of all, it\'s time-travel-historical-japan-isekai. I eat up that kind of stuff the same way I do dinosaur chicken nuggets. It\'s a genre that\'s a definite guilty pleasure of mine. Plotwise, we follow a high school girl who\'s name I\'ve genuinely forgotten get involved in a gas explosion that teleports her into the past. There, she meets a guy, and typical Takahashi antics ensue.You can definitely see some of the foundations of Inuyasha, but there were more than enough differences for me to separate the two in my mind. The story is rather interesting itself, as it combines a sense of mystery with a tiny bit of action, a large dose of romance, and just a smidge of ~incest.~Wait, incest?No, don\'t worry, we can pull out the ""no chromo"" card here since there is no technical incest in this OVA! Hooray! Still, that did make for a very awkward couple of minutes in the middle of the runtime. Well, whatever, I\'ll take what I can get. (If you watch this OVA you will see what I mean).Setting aside that factor, the romance is weirdly kind of cute in that 80s-Takahashi-way, and I was genuinely intrigued. And since there wasn\'t too much going on plotwise in the first place, most things get wrapped up by the end of the OVA in a satisfying way, leaving me content at the end of my viewing.So what\'s the rundown? Do I recommend Fire Tripper? Eh, sure, why not.', 'Fire Tripper is based off a story from Rumiko Takahashi’s ‘Rumic World’ series, the other segments are: Warau Hyōteki, Maris: The Chōjo, and Ningyo Shirīzu. Despite my affection for Takahashi’s Urusei Yatsura, I couldn’t fathom what this particular OVA was trying to say. There are a couple of cool ideas, like time warping via fire and multiple copies of a single person floating through separate time periods, but Fire Tripper fails to monopolize the interesting aspects of its plot.—Story/CharactersThe series follows an ordinary teenage girl named Suzuko, who—prior to her introduction—dreams that she is a little girl from the *Feudal era, that dies by getting...crushed by a wooden beam in a burning shack. After waking up, Suzuko decides to walk a small neighborhood boy, Shūhei, home from the park. He shows off the scars from having his appendix removed and as they are walking, there is a fatal gas explosion from a nearby power plant. Both of them are caught in the explosion and, suddenly, Suzuko is suddenly laying in a pile of corpses in a battlefield.*Also known as the Kamakura period: 1185–1333.A group of gangly vagabonds attempt to rape her, but she is rescued by a teenage boy named Shūkumaru. Shūkumaru brings Suzuko back to his village, gives his younger sister (Suzu) a bell as a gift, and then claims that he will marry Suzuko. Afterwards, Shūkumaru takes Suzuko into a storehouse to get her clean clothes. It is revealed that Shūkumaru has fleeced corpses for their wares and collected them for supplies to aid the villagers. Suzuko finds Shūhei’s t-shirt among the pile of clothes, deduces that he must have been sent back in time with her, and tries to find him… but to no avail.After a night of Shūkumaru trying to bed her but, drunkenly, passing out instead—Suzuko has an epiphany after seeing Suzu’s bell again; remembering that she has an identical one back in her own world! Suzuko then deducts that ‘Suzu’ is an alternate timeline version of herself, meaning that Shūkumaru is actually her brother!Suzuko is tormented by the fact that they are siblings, because she has fallen in love with Shūkumaru. The village once again burns, like in her dream, because of the evil *Akauma. The scene from her dream is replicated and ‘Suzu’ is sent to the future, after being crushed by a fiery beam. Suzuko then realizes that the fire is a catalyst to travel between the past and the future. Shūkumaru is losing to Akauma, so Suzuko uses the fire to transport her and Shūkumaru to the future.*Akauma is a play on the Japanese word ‘akuma’ (悪魔), which means ‘demon’ or ‘devil.’After they arrive, Suzuko takes Shūkumaru to her house to dress his wounds. While doing so, she notices that Shūkumaru has the same scar that Shūhei had from his appendix removal and realizes they’re the same person! It turns out that Shūkumaru had gone back in time over a decade earlier than she had and grown up in the Feudal era, therefore Shūkumaru is not biologically related to her—he is an adopted brother from the other dimension. They then realize that they had gone back to the period, right before the initial gas explosion. So, they use the factory’s explosion again to go back in time again and announce their engagement to the other villagers. The end.Oh man! Where do I begin, first of all, what is the point of this story? Did Rumiko Takahashi have a elementary schooler as a neighbor and thought, ‘If both of us used a time warp, then that kid could be my husband some day!’ Another point, and a common point of contention within the isekai genre, is wouldn’t she miss her family? How is she so okay with living in the Feudal era and never seeing them again? Does she just plan to set herself on fire, or something, to go visit them?Another thing that I didn’t understand is why did Shūhei arrive in the Kamakura period—over a decade prior to Suzuko making it there? Does that mean that she was stuck in a dimensional interstice all that time? If that’s the case, how were Suzuko and Shūkumaru able to time travel perfect in synch the other two times? Towards the end, they knew that the power plant was going to explode… why didn’t they try to warn anyone, instead of using the explosion to go back in time? Also, when Shūkumaru and Suzuko returned—the village had been completely decimated by Akauma and it looked like many people had lost their lives; Shūkumaru bails on people that depend on his protection and then happily announces his soon-to-be marriage upon his return? What the hell?As you can see, the story makes no sense whatsoever and there isn’t even anything to be gleaned from it. Heck, the characters aren’t even likable. Suzuko is a bland Mary Sue, Shūkumaru is a barbarian, Suzuko’s parents don’t have any personality, and Akauma is just a typical mongoloid pillager. This is the first time, in quite a while, that I’ve felt that I completely wasted my time on an anime!I guess it’s to be expected, the only other ‘Rumic World’ story that I’ve seen is Ningyo Shirīzu, also known as ‘Mermaid Saga’ and I didn’t care for that OVA either. I haven’t watched the television series yet, but it is relatively low on my priority list—seeing as the OVA was a mess!—TechnicalThere’s nothing particularly bad about the visual direction, but there’s nothing memorable either. It just looks like your typical run-of-the-mill ‘80s OVA. The director, Motosuke Takahashi, is known for directing *Warau Hyōteki, *Maris: The Chōjo, Cosmo Police Justy, Aitsu to Lullaby: Suiyobi no Cinderella, and Harbor Light Monogatari: Fashion Lala yori. Sadly, Motosuke Takahashi passed away on November 8th, 2007 due to lung cancer complications.*Both Warau Hyōteki and Maris: The Chōjo are from Rumiko Takahashi’s ‘Rumic World’ series.Despite my dislike of the story, this production brought in a few A-list seiyū. The first is Yū Mizushima, voice of Shūkumaru. Mr. Mizushima was cast regularly as the lead protagonist in many anime productions of the ‘70s and ‘80s, usually either voicing an action hero or the love interest—in series whose target demographic was primarily little girls, like Mahō no Tenshi Creamy Mami and Tokimeki Tonight. Mr. Mizushima is still doing voice work for anime, at age 63—as well as doing Japanese dubs of live-action shows, like voice-overs for franchises like Friends and Star Wars!

At age 65, she is still working in the industry and even does video game voice overs, as well as Japanese dubbing for foreign films—Star Wars (Princess Leia) and Watchmen (Sally Jupiter) are among her credited roles!

Asuka—Urusei Yatsura, is in love with her brother and Suzuko—Fire Tripper, thinks she’s in love with her brother. Both are from separate Rumiko Takahashi stories. And, coincidentally, both have the same seiyū!Akauma’s seiyū, Tesshō Genda, is another veteran voice actor that continues to work in the industry.

When I saw a guy dressed in warrior attire and a girl in a school uniform my only reaction was ""don\'t tell me this is the same as Inuyasha"". Well it kinda is... and kinda not at the same time.I checked...the manga first and then looked at the reviews on here which lowered my expectations by a lot. But in reality it is not even close to being as bad as some make it out to be, it was actually way better than I expected.The premise is basically the same as Inuyasha: school girl is transported to the sengoku period by mistake, meets bratty strong guy and falls in love.However, the actual plot is very different and pretty interesting. It\'s another take on the whole time-traveling aspect.The story is easy to follow and actually keeps you engaged the whole 48 minutes. It becomes really interesting towards the end and it actually does a pretty great job of making you wonder what is actually going on until everything comes to a conclusion. Of course it does not have a ton of depth and many aspects are left unanswered, but that is to be expected from a 50min show and a 50page manga. The story moves very fast and it\'s all condensed but it seems to be pretty well pased for something that takes place over only a few days.The characters are ok. The girl is by far boring compared to Takahashi\'s usual female leads while the guy is pretty typical for her work, reminds me a bit of Koga from Inuyasha.The art and sound are not great given that it is such an old show but its watchable, no issues there.Overall, I think this is a decent short story. You should not expect this to be like an anime movie or a series, its very underdeveloped because of the lenght but the story has potential. That is probably why Inuyasha exists. I can\'t help to think that this might have been the original draft for the story that has later become Inuyasha and that it was the result of her experimenting with an isekai.If you liked Inuyasha or her work, this is worth a watch. Even if you don\'t but enjoy short stories it might be fun for you. But if you are looking for a well developed story with great and relatable characters, this might not be for you. the manga first and then looked at the reviews on here which lowered my expectations by a lot.

What? This was just so mid, it felt like they had an idea for something and didn't bother fleshing it out or elaborating on it any further. It needed a lot of fine...tuning, the animation isn't the best either, and you can tell it was cheap there's just ridiculous amounts of still air and still frames, lot's of silence or bare bones ambient music.i normally dig older anime like this, no matter how bad, but I was not vibing with this one I gotta be honest. tuning, the animation isn't the best either, and you can tell it was cheap there's just ridiculous amounts of still air and still frames, lot's of silence or bare bones ambient music.i normally dig older anime like this, no matter how bad, but I was not vibing with this one I gotta be honest."", ""this story just makes my head spin. first i think it's a past self meets younger self movie, and then it turns to be supposed incest plot line and then very predictably so the guy actually turns out to be her own adopted family's brother.

Fushigi no Kuni no Alice,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2572/Fushigi_no_Kuni_no_Alice,"['I could\'ve had done this review a long time ago, but couldn\'t find the time to do it. but now that i\'m back to review some anime shows for a bit, i\'ll start with the one that i finished back in june. This one being Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland by Nippon Animation.Now you already know that there\'s Walt Disney\'s adaption of Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland back in 1951, but have you ever heard of Nippon Animation\'s own adaption of this said fairy tale? This show was released in 1983 with little success as it was overshadowed by the said Disney film and only 26 episodes...were released in Japan and dubbed in english for the american broadcast. However, it did find some decent popularity in european countries, latin countries and arabic countries like saudi arabia for example. The show is an japanese-german collaboration between Nippon Animation (Which you already know who they are just by reading my reviews on some of their animes by now) and the german studio Apollo Films. Which both animated and dubbed this anime while it was running on televisionWhich lead us to this question: Is this anime as good as many people make it out to be back in the 80s and 90s? I guess we\'ll just have to find out:First off, the story. Considering that this is an anime adaptation of the fairy tale, you\'d wonder if this follows the story from the books, right? Well, more or less. You see, the story does follow a bit from two books in each half and in episodic format. The first half being Alice in Wonderland, while the other follows the Alice Through the Looking Glass. The only difference, however, is that while the movie tells Alice exploring through the entirety of Wonderland, in this show, the show follows a bit closer to the novels and also takes place in Alice\'s homeland, England. Where it can be seen her parents and her sister, Celia. Also, the anime shows that Alice can go to Wonderland when she either goes to the cave that the White Rabbit went or while she ends up falling asleep and ends up dreaming, which leads her to go to Wonderland. Not sure if that was the case since i can\'t tell if she was dreaming or just suddendly entered Wonderland. And also, by the end of the episode, she comes back to real world, which has her telling her parents what she saw, which the parents and her sister get confused. Call it an transition if you will.So what do i think about the story? Well, it\'s decent to a certain degree. While there were some episodes that i did find them boring at times, there were a few that i did liked mostly because of how silly the stories are. One that is about trying to leave the forest with no name, where the people end up switching personalities and start acting like crazy, one that is about the white rabbit getting fired because of his incompetence and getting replaced by the black rabbit (Don\'t ask questions), one that is about the citizens of Wonderland competing in a race where nobody loses and the one that has a fight between the lion and the unicorn. My personal favorite episode so far is about the queen getting fed up with idiots to the point that she decided to put everyone to go to school to start studying and learning. Again, not all the episodes are great, but it does have a good amount of episodes worth watching.Of course we have the characters of the show. Of course we still get to see more of these characters from the novels. You have Alice, who is the main character of the show, you have the white rabbit, you have the Tweedle brothers, you have Humpty Dumpty, you have the Mad Hatter and March Hare, you have Cheshire Cat, you have the Queen of Hearts, you have Jabberwocky, etc. Although some of them differs their personalities, like for example, Cheshire Cat now became a more bumbler guy, rather than being a smart aleck. There\'s one character that appears exclusively for this anime. And that character is Benny Bunny, who is the white rabbit\'s nephew. He usually comes off as Alice\'s companion through out her adventures in Wonderland and usually gets along with her, although they did bickered at times. Not much of an interesting character, but i find him cute enough. So yeah, aside from Benny and a few different personalities for some of the Wonderlanders, the characters are pretty much the same as the novels. So no need to go deep on them.The animation is alright, even for 1983. While the characters don\'t look THAT great, atleast Nippon gets the job done with the character designs decently well. I personally liked Alice\'s design a bit more. She looks much more cuter in her red clothing and nice color to differentiate from the novels and the movies like the Disney version. Same with the background animations. Looks nice to look at especially for some of the unique ones. Like the mushrooms and the castle.Now for the audio. But before i delve into it, i\'d like to adress that i watched the european portuguese dub of the german dub of this anime. The reasons for this is that:1) Those two dubs actually has 52 episodes in total instead of just 24. The reason why this anime\'s MAL page is still set to 24 episodes only is because the japanese dub only lasted for 24 episodes and those said 24 only got dubbed in japanese.And 2) I can\'t seem to find the japanese dub anywhere on the internet aside from just one video on Youtube where they said their goodbyes. So i have to go for the portuguese dub since it\'s the one that is almost entirely available on Youtube.Anyway, now back to the review. As far as the audio goes, it\'s alright. I personally find the eletronic music being a bit out of place for this whimsical anime. Sure it\'s nice to listen to and the german opening theme song ""Alice Im Wunderland"" is a nice song to listen to, but again, i find it out of place for a anime that adapts a very crazy and whimsical fairy tale from the 19th century.And finally, the voice acting. Mostly in portuguese though, because i never got a chance to experience the japanese dub aside from, again, that video where they said their goodbyes.Anyway, the portuguese dub was made and aired on RTP1 in 1987 by the portuguese dubbing studio named ""Videoplano"". They are the same studio that dubbed other anime shows like The Adventures of Nils Holgersson and Ozamu Tezuka\'s Aoi Blink.Just like Dogtatian and the Three Muskehound\'s 1983 portuguese dub, this one also survived, as well, thanks to the releases of all the episodes on home video by Planeta Diagostini. And it\'s the one that i saw thanks to Youtube. So i\'m glad that i got to watch the dub of this anime with barely any issues.Anyway, as far as the portuguese dub goes, it\'s pretty good. Many voice actors did a good job at voicing their characters with their own unique voices lent to the characters. I especially loved Carmen Santos voicing the Queen of Hearts, António Feio voicing the white rabbit, the late Argentina Rocha as the voice of Benny Bunny, Luis Mascarenhas as the voice of Humpy Dumpty (Which is the only well known Disney voice actor to ever voice a anime character) and João Lourenço as the voice of Jabberwocky. But again, just like Dogtanian\'s portuguese voice in Wanwan Sanjuushi, i also find Alice\'s portuguese voice actress, Isabel Ribas, to be unfitting for the character. Again, don\'t get me wrong, i like her voice well enough, but the issue i have with her being the voice of Alice is the same issue i had with João Lourenço as the voice of Dogtanian. She sounds way too adult to voice a child character. Especially considering that Isabel was 29 years old at the time. But yeah, that\'s the only nitpick i have with the portuguese dub. But anyway, it\'s a pretty good dub for all things considered.So in conclusion, i think this anime did aged decently well enough to make me continue watching until the end of the show. While there has been a few issues here and there, i had a good time watching this anime despite it\'s age. It definitely is nice to see Nippon Animation decided to have it\'s take on Alice\'s Adventure in Wonderland. While it\'s not as good as Walt Disney\'s 1951 adaption, it definitely is million times better than that shitty Disney live-action remakes from the 2010s decade.The only issue now is that it\'s hard to find a japanese dub of all the episodes available to watch and the english dub only managed to dub 24 episodes. So the only way for you to experience the same way as i did is if you learn other languages that\'s not english or japanese and watch the entire show with an different language. Whether in portuguese, german, french, arabian, spanish or whatever language you learned.But anyway, if i have to give it a rating, i\'d say i\'d give it an 7 out of 10. Not exactly Nippon\'s best work, but it\'s a very nice show to watch if i have to be generous.Anyway, i hope you enjoyed my review after a long hiatus. My name is José Diogo and i\'ll come back with some more reviews next time. were released in Japan and dubbed in english for the american broadcast. However, it did find some decent popularity in european countries, latin countries and arabic countries like saudi arabia for example. The show is an japanese-german collaboration between Nippon Animation (Which you already know who they are just by reading my reviews on some of their animes by now) and the german studio Apollo Films. Which both animated and dubbed this anime while it was running on televisionWhich lead us to this question: Is this anime as good as many people make it out to be back in the 80s and 90s? I guess we\'ll just have to find out:First off, the story. Considering that this is an anime adaptation of the fairy tale, you\'d wonder if this follows the story from the books, right? Well, more or less. You see, the story does follow a bit from two books in each half and in episodic format. The first half being Alice in Wonderland, while the other follows the Alice Through the Looking Glass. The only difference, however, is that while the movie tells Alice exploring through the entirety of Wonderland, in this show, the show follows a bit closer to the novels and also takes place in Alice\'s homeland, England. Where it can be seen her parents and her sister, Celia. Also, the anime shows that Alice can go to Wonderland when she either goes to the cave that the White Rabbit went or while she ends up falling asleep and ends up dreaming, which leads her to go to Wonderland. Not sure if that was the case since i can\'t tell if she was dreaming or just suddendly entered Wonderland. And also, by the end of the episode, she comes back to real world, which has her telling her parents what she saw, which the parents and her sister get confused. Call it an transition if you will.So what do i think about the story? Well, it\'s decent to a certain degree. While there were some episodes that i did find them boring at times, there were a few that i did liked mostly because of how silly the stories are. One that is about trying to leave the forest with no name, where the people end up switching personalities and start acting like crazy, one that is about the white rabbit getting fired because of his incompetence and getting replaced by the black rabbit (Don\'t ask questions), one that is about the citizens of Wonderland competing in a race where nobody loses and the one that has a fight between the lion and the unicorn. My personal favorite episode so far is about the queen getting fed up with idiots to the point that she decided to put everyone to go to school to start studying and learning. Again, not all the episodes are great, but it does have a good amount of episodes worth watching.Of course we have the characters of the show.

Galilei Donna,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19367/Galilei_Donna,"[""Recently, anime adaptations of western culture have become somewhat of an outlandish trend. Not only are these adaptations capitalized by world-building over historical accuracy, but they are also filled with unremarkable plot twists that occur spontaneously. Instead of quality writing and a substantial narrative, one will find uninspired executions of characterization and pretentious attempts at making grandiose, explosive scenes seem more than they really are. Regrettably, Galilei Donna is an anime that exhibits the very shortcomings of this trend.In retrospect, Galilei Donna had it all: gorgeous sceneries, splendorous mecha battles, and a bizarre but spectacular synopsis. It had the makings of a great sci-fi tale,...an epic journey about finding and reconciling with personal insecurities, and an innocent slice of life series. However, because it lacked the patience to blend these elements together harmoniously, Galilei Donna ends up having something of an identity crisis.Set in the future of metropolitan Italy, Galilei Donna starts by introducing us to the three sisters: Hazuki, Kazuki, and Hozuki. As descendants of Galileo, they are a trio of the Ferrari family, each bearing her own distinct personalities. One day, agents from an enigmatic organization show up to chase after the three sisters, supposedly seeking for a family treasure called the Galileo Tesoro. By the time these agents have encircled the Ferrari family, we find out that the youngest sister Hozuki, a prepubescent girl, just so happens to have a flying goldfish machine to save them from the perpetrators. Before we're given any other information, we learn that she also miraculously constructed the entire machine by herself. And very conveniently so. Thus begins a traditional game of cat and mouse and treasure hunting.A story composed largely of coincidences is just a sorry excuse for poor writing. For some reason, this is an inference that Galileo Donna doesn't seem to understand. See a missile flying towards you?—No worries, a deus ex machina will nullify the belligerence. Stuck in the past?—No tears, an unexplained chemical storm will drain you back to the future. It is ludicrous how, by being so painstakingly unpredictable, this series has become so very predictable.Moreover, it tries very little to explicate the premise beyond its plot elements, and even when attempted, Galilei Donna does it in a fairly half-baked and frivolous manner. In a way, Galilei Donna could be trying to immerse the viewer in another dimension, however, this usually works atrociously. For instance, whenever Galilei Donna introduces details or tries to add depth to its plot, it’s done so very capriciously, and due to there being little purpose to these gimmicks beyond their initial use, they become arbitrary rather than significant contributions—recyclable instead of irreplaceable characters and causes.Likewise, there’s also a lavish amount of gratuitous scenes. In general, there are lots of events that occur nonsensically. One scene could present some semi-humorless drama with a dark overtone, while the next would present something completely irrelevant or dissonant with the mood. From one frame to another, Galilei Donna would jump from the cute sisters doing cute things, to a sequence of imposing mecha fights. Unfortunately, this not only creates many discrepancies, but also discredits the overall seriousness of the plot.Following the lackluster plot, a vast majority of the characters are two-dimensional. Their personalities are mostly caricatured; and their backstories often hackneyed. Out of the three sisters, Hazuki acts dramatically; Kazuki acts conservatively but at times speaks derisively; and Hozuki acts impulsively, yet is given the heaviest duties of the three. Most side characters chiefly serve as caricatures or comic reliefs, and though as humorous as they are, their antics get old by the third—fourth—until which time? There is a decent amount of time spent developing Hozuki’s character, but all of that is annulled each time she regresses back due to her insecurities. Sure, the last episodes provide her with some flair, but even marrying Galileo couldn't convert a duckling into a swan.In comparison, the animation is simply splendid. Altogether, the background frameworks and scenery presentations paint a stellar landscape of the setting, and while perhaps overly extravagant, they provide the audience with a stimulating backdrop.Additionally, there are a decent amount of mouthwatering mecha sequences in Galilei Donna. Poor concepts and designs (a goldfish mecha, really?) aside, the action frames are usually coherent, fluid, and pleasant for the eye. Mecha and action junkies will unlikely be disappointed. In fact, this should be one of the only sensible reasons one should watch Galilei Donna: for the stellar animation.Similarly, the music delivers some relaxing and vigorous tones. The background music is silent when no sound is required, and switches back on whenever appropriate. However, the voice acting cast appears to be lacking in some aspects, as there weren't many outstanding voice talents. Not that there needed to be prominent voice actors or actresses voicing the characters, but the lack of tonal variances and fluctuations made some scenes feel unexpectedly dull and underwhelming.Mindless entertainment—this is essentially what Galilei Donna is. A farcical story accompanied by insipid characters, Galilei Donna is a series meant to be taken at face value. Cheaply written narratives, convenient story resolutions, and lip-smacking visuals: these are what defines Galilei Donna. Be prompted to witness an in-cohesive mix of mecha battles, pseudo-mystery solving, and cute girls doing cute things. However, if any of those doesn't sound appealing, avoid Galilei Donna like the plague. an epic journey about finding and reconciling with personal insecurities, and an innocent slice of life series.

A world of that is filled with science and politics, a world in which space vehicles are a common sight in the form of goldfishes. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the series takes place in a futuristic setting. The technology is there. The conflicts are set. And in the center of it all are three young girls with nothing in common except their last names. They are the Ferrari family and no, they don’t come with a garage.Noitamina has always been known to present unique series with all types of tropes. This time, they bring forth a new title...out of their hats with this little scientific adventure. It’s a ride that started out well with the settings, characters, and themes. Yasoumi Umetsu whom is in charged with the directing is often more known for his work in the animation department. Memorable series such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, and Welcome to the NHK were all part of his work with his animation style. However this time around, he plays the role of a director. Unfortunately, that role didn’t go in a path of success. Instead, it dropped like a slippery slope faster than Ferrari ride.Essentially, the series blasts off like a rocket. Even the first few minutes of the show is breathtaking with a devastating mecha engagement that puts many peoples' lives at risk. The extravagance of this start will easily have viewers’ eyes glued to the screen as we are curious to see what’s going to happen next. For what we may know, the Ferrari sisters have become targets by kidnappers that seemed to want a bounty on their heads. The Ferrari sisters themselves have almost nothing in common in terms of their intellect levels, personalities, or appearances. What they have in common is the blood pumping in their veins that signifies their ancestry towards a well-known physicist, Galileo Galilei. There’s definitely a legitimate reason why kidnappers want to target them from the very beginning. Although vaguely explained or elaborated, it’s easy to guess because of their ancestry and what they might inherit. But even with this set up, there’s interest because the way the story is set up. That’s what I thought at first anyways.But the tragedy doesn’t stop there. We quickly find out the girls’ lives is no fairy tale. It’s a grim reality because what happens in their hometown changes their lives forever. There’s some odd twists, foreshadowing, but also predictable factors that constructs the story. By odd twists, I mean it in a way that tries to set up a sort of suspense for viewers. While this works out right at first, it takes away the more emotional factors later on in the show with certain revelations. At the same time, it become strange to realize certain characters’ roles have altered greatly from their original set up. There’s also suspense among the characters themselves in regards to what they inherit. For all they know, it’s important. Unfortunately, they don’t know themselves what their kidnappers want from them. It’s a decent set up to a mystery if the show walks on that route most of the time. However, it instead goes on a path involving a travesty of justice involving the ambitions of our antagonists. To make it worse, certain “good guys” in this show turns out not to be so good after all reflecting on an antithesis in their roles. It becomes absurd at certain points with the various plot holes and hard to absorb it in all at once. It's ravaging to see what direction the story will go. Given the previous experience of director Umetsu, he’s trying to create some sense of insanity in this show while creating a sense of mystery. That sense becomes a degeneration later on as there’s just too much to take in all at once. This doesn't also help with the fact with certain supernatural twists added to the series involving a bit of science travel.As the main stars, the Ferrari sisters are the driving force of this show. Their oddly similarly names - Hazuki, Kazuki, and Hozuki have almost nothing in common. Hazuki is the eldest of the trio who has the dream of becoming a lawyer. Taking on the role of the elder child, she is supposed to be the guardian in the absence of her parents. Instead, what do we get? A young woman with high level drinking tendency fused with a wild personality and amazing brutality through the words of her mouth. Kazuki is the middle child that plays more of the cold role. She hides her emotions most of the time although deep down has problems of her own like skipping class. Finally, the youngest of the sisters Hozuki has a strong interest in science. Little do her parents or classmates know that she is behind the creation of humongous mecha. It’s odd since she plays more of a role in action than her siblings despite being the youngest. In this role, she goes against the typical ‘big sister should look out for her younger sibling’. In essence, these trio of girls mostly are isolated from one another despite being close to one another after their reunion. The only time they seem to coexist whole together is when their lives are truly in grave danger. Hazuki does display her role to protect her sisters but often lacks the direct initiatives. It’s only when danger comes the shove is when she takes direct action. To say the least, the Ferrari family is the like the wheels of an incomplete vehicle. It’s missing the steering wheel because of their parents.As far as action goes, there’s plenty of opportunities for that. The scientific inventions in this futuristic worlds sets off a decent balance of motifs and warfare. The mecha designs reflects a style of what futuristic spacecrafts looks like. Taken for granted however is the shape of Hozuki’s choice of vehicles as they take shape of goldfishes. It may be the symbol for peace and hope as their hometown have become infested with bounty hunters. The aerial combat otherwise is played out in a fantastic fashion with added aesthetics. The way the world is crafted also resembles a bit of a steampunk style that paints a more elaborated meaning to the aircrafts.On a more negative symmetry is some of the absurdity of the series. Not only do they open up plot holes with weak characterization but they also creates too much twists. In fact, some of the supporting characters and even antagonists such as Roberto gets more insight. The weakness also deals with a lack of historical backgrounds involving Ferrari’s family. What we get instead is whom they are now rather than whom they were in the past obliterating a sense of relevant characterization. Some other characters also shines more than the Ferrari family such as the flamboyant leader of the air pirate group, Cicinho. Later on, there are also sudden tragedies and violence that comes into play to sent some sort of message. It feels a bit senseless since there are stages of interlude that degrades the overall story. Other times, sudden events feels rushed and makes little sense in essence.The artwork of this show is brilliant with constructed talent. Noitamina’s animation brings out a sense of uniqueness especially with the space vehicles. A1-Pictures crafts the Ferrari sisters’ charms to relevance. The backgrounds is gorgeous along with the gadgets that forges the installation of the settings. The setting also makes sense since it takes place in a futuristic world. The artwork reflects that and conveys it with a purpose. An example is how the sisters looks quite different in appearance despite their blood relations. Most of the characters also has their designs that matches them. The stage of the series also gives off an Italian like feeling with its backgrounds. Fan service is minimal and completely omits the typical onsen/beach episodes so you can save your headaches for those fillers.Soundtrack wise, the show is well balanced. OST is performed fashionably during action scenes. When emotional moments takes the stage, the soundtrack backs it up to convey the tone. There’s also bits of comedy but most of it sets forth a more mystery like atmosphere. The Ferrari sister’s voices matches well that matches each of their characters whether it’s confident, stoic, enthusiastic, joy, or sorrowful. Both the OP (Synchromanica) and ED (Innocent) gives off a feeling of scientific creativity, charm, innocence. Additionally, it creates a sense of unity as we see many shots of the sisters together like actual siblings.So ultimately, how do I describe Galilei Donna? It felt like watching National Treasure with a less emphasis on mystery solving. Because the show defies common sense at various stages, it’s hard to take it seriously sometimes despite the way it started. The characters are hard to get used to at first and some might not ever be in your favor by the time the show ends. There’s a lack of characterization and plot holes here and there surrounded by inconsistency. On the other hand though, the technical aspects courtesy of A1-Pictures demonstrates a superior presentation of the futuristic world that the show takes place in. Some of the tragedies and emotional factors might also hit a nerve for viewers. And being labeled as a show with galactic star wars extravaganza, the action of the series is well performed. So sit back and enjoy that when you witness crafty vehicles and fish shaped ships fire away. Now with only 11 episodes, this show will be a breeze to get through as long as you’re aware to what you signed up for. out of their hats with this little scientific adventure.

That’s what I thought at first anyways.But the tragedy doesn’t stop there. We quickly find out the girls’ lives is no fairy tale. It’s a grim reality because what happens in their hometown changes their lives forever. There’s some odd twists, foreshadowing, but also predictable factors that constructs the story. By odd twists, I mean it in a way that tries to set up a sort of suspense for viewers. While this works out right at first, it takes away the more emotional factors later on in the show with certain revelations. At the same time, it become strange to realize certain characters’ roles have altered greatly from their original set up. There’s also suspense among the characters themselves in regards to what they inherit. For all they know, it’s important. Unfortunately, they don’t know themselves what their kidnappers want from them. It’s a decent set up to a mystery if the show walks on that route most of the time. However, it instead goes on a path involving a travesty of justice involving the ambitions of our antagonists. To make it worse, certain “good guys” in this show turns out not to be so good after all reflecting on an antithesis in their roles. It becomes absurd at certain points with the various plot holes and hard to absorb it in all at once. It's ravaging to see what direction the story will go. Given the previous experience of director Umetsu, he’s trying to create some sense of insanity in this show while creating a sense of mystery. That sense becomes a degeneration later on as there’s just too much to take in all at once. This doesn't also help with the fact with certain supernatural twists added to the series involving a bit of science travel.As the main stars, the Ferrari sisters are the driving force of this show. Their oddly similarly names - Hazuki, Kazuki, and Hozuki have almost nothing in common. Hazuki is the eldest of the trio who has the dream of becoming a lawyer. Taking on the role of the elder child, she is supposed to be the guardian in the absence of her parents. Instead, what do we get? A young woman with high level drinking tendency fused with a wild personality and amazing brutality through the words of her mouth. Kazuki is the middle child that plays more of the cold role. She hides her emotions most of the time although deep down has problems of her own like skipping class. Finally, the youngest of the sisters Hozuki has a strong interest in science. Little do her parents or classmates know that she is behind the creation of humongous mecha. It’s odd since she plays more of a role in action than her siblings despite being the youngest. In this role, she goes against the typical ‘big sister should look out for her younger sibling’. In essence, these trio of girls mostly are isolated from one another despite being close to one another after their reunion. The only time they seem to coexist whole together is when their lives are truly in grave danger. Hazuki does display her role to protect her sisters but often lacks the direct initiatives. It’s only when danger comes the shove is when she takes direct action. To say the least, the Ferrari family is the like the wheels of an incomplete vehicle. It’s missing the steering wheel because of their parents.As far as action goes, there’s plenty of opportunities for that. The scientific inventions in this futuristic worlds sets off a decent balance of motifs and warfare. The mecha designs reflects a style of what futuristic spacecrafts looks like. Taken for granted however is the shape of Hozuki’s choice of vehicles as they take shape of goldfishes. It may be the symbol for peace and hope as their hometown have become infested with bounty hunters. The aerial combat otherwise is played out in a fantastic fashion with added aesthetics. The way the world is crafted also resembles a bit of a steampunk style that paints a more elaborated meaning to the aircrafts.On a more negative symmetry is some of the absurdity of the series. Not only do they open up plot holes with weak characterization but they also creates too much twists. In fact, some of the supporting characters and even antagonists such as Roberto gets more insight. The weakness also deals with a lack of historical backgrounds involving Ferrari’s family. What we get instead is whom they are now rather than whom they were in the past obliterating a sense of relevant characterization. Some other characters also shines more than the Ferrari family such as the flamboyant leader of the air pirate group, Cicinho. Later on, there are also sudden tragedies and violence that comes into play to sent some sort of message. It feels a bit senseless since there are stages of interlude that degrades the overall story. Other times, sudden events feels rushed and makes little sense in essence.The artwork of this show is brilliant with constructed talent. Noitamina’s animation brings out a sense of uniqueness especially with the space vehicles. A1-Pictures crafts the Ferrari sisters’ charms to relevance. The backgrounds is gorgeous along with the gadgets that forges the installation of the settings. The setting also makes sense since it takes place in a futuristic world. The artwork reflects that and conveys it with a purpose. An example is how the sisters looks quite different in appearance despite their blood relations. Most of the characters also has their designs that matches them. The stage of the series also gives off an Italian like feeling with its backgrounds. Fan service is minimal and completely omits the typical onsen/beach episodes so you can save your headaches for those fillers.Soundtrack wise, the show is well balanced. OST is performed fashionably during action scenes. When emotional moments takes the stage, the soundtrack backs it up to convey the tone. There’s also bits of comedy but most of it sets forth a more mystery like atmosphere. The Ferrari sister’s voices matches well that matches each of their characters whether it’s confident, stoic, enthusiastic, joy, or sorrowful. Both the OP (Synchromanica) and ED (Innocent) gives off a feeling of scientific creativity, charm, innocence. Additionally, it creates a sense of unity as we see many shots of the sisters together like actual siblings.So ultimately, how do I describe Galilei Donna? It felt like watching National Treasure with a less emphasis on mystery solving. Because the show defies common sense at various stages, it’s hard to take it seriously sometimes despite the way it started. The characters are hard to get used to at first and some might not ever be in your favor by the time the show ends. There’s a lack of characterization and plot holes here and there surrounded by inconsistency. On the other hand though, the technical aspects courtesy of A1-Pictures demonstrates a superior presentation of the futuristic world that the show takes place in. Some of the tragedies and emotional factors might also hit a nerve for viewers. And being labeled as a show with galactic star wars extravaganza, the action of the series is well performed. So sit back and enjoy that when you witness crafty vehicles and fish shaped ships fire away. Now with only 11 episodes, this show will be a breeze to get through as long as you’re aware to what you signed up for."", 'Put simply, Galilei Donna is an abject failure, a complete trainwreck of a show, and by merely reading this review, you have already wasted too much of your life on it. The show\'s premise seems full of promise, a complicated post-environmental apocalypse world with megacorporations and sky pirates and the ever-encroaching threat of complete energy collapse. Add to this main characters with pluck, and a story that concerns itself with a major historical figure, and you have something for everyone, be they fan of moe, mecha action, American Treasure-style clue-following, or a projection of what our world might become. All in theory. In reality, you...have two meaningless protagonists next to Hozuki, who is one of the most dreadful mary sue characters I\'ve seen in a professionally written work, and who doesn\'t even have the common courtesy to be adorable while doing so. You have mecha that show up rarely, and work so hard to match the bizarre obsession with goldfish that it ruins what little interesting design it had come up with. You have ""clues"" that literally boil down to an AI telling them where they go next, without even real sight-seeing eyecandy to show for it, before they just stumble over the next piece of the puzzle. Plus, we spend the entire show in either a strange version of Italy that\'s basically just like Japan with silly outfits, a Japan which is just Japan with a little extra snow, or the middle of a desert. None of it\'s pieces fit, none of the promise is delivered upon. Even the protagonists themselves have no real character development, with the non-Hozuki protagonists being actively ignored by the plot, to the degree that one receives literally no plot arc, and the other having an arc that consists of staring longly at a picture, being shunned wordlessly, and then throwing away the picture. The primary antagonist\'s hitman receives more character development and backstory examination than every other character combined, and frankly, I\'d much rather have watched a show about him. The only even barely likable character is Cinciho, a sky pirate, whose primary trait that makes him amusing is being voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya.Simply put, the story and characters are complete crap, the art ranges from below average to passable, and the only high points are a couple of musical pieces and the aforementioned sky pirate. To cap off this abortion masquerading as entertainment, the entire work is based off the creators mistaken belief that Galileo was actually Leonardo Da Vinci. 2/10, and may God preserve us from any additional content within this work. have two meaningless protagonists next to Hozuki, who is one of the most dreadful mary sue characters I\'ve seen in a professionally written work, and who doesn\'t even have the common courtesy to be adorable while doing so.

Since I don’t agree with most of the reviews about this anime I’ll be writing my own with my point of view about Galilei Donna.Galilei Donna’s about three sisters, Hozuki, Kazuki and Hazuki, these sisters are descendants of Galileo. They end up ultimately getting in trouble and become essentially wanted criminals and are made travelling...around the world gathering Moon Sketches left by Galileo with the objective of discovering the Galileo’s Tesoro and avoid the people targeting the sisters from actually getting it first.After watching all the episodes I can say that the plot execution is not perfect, however, it’s not horrid or even mediocre like most of the people around here seem to think, it has its flaws and a few plot holes here and there but it isn’t by all means unwatchable and I’ve watched really really worse things that didn’t get rated as low as I’ve seen around here.Now that I got this out of the way, let’s get to the characters shall we?The main characters, the three sisters aren’t by all means you stereotypical sisters, they’re all really different from each other and all of them want different things. Hozuki, being the youngest, is portrayed as a really pure and nice girl. She’s really good at physics and science, developing the Galileo (the big fish mecha) by herself and her objective was the attaining of the Moon sketches and the Galileo Tesoro. The middle one, Kazuki who is shown to be a really emotional girl that seems to deny as much as possible what’s happening, she also had knowledge on some sort of martial art that she used one or two times throughout the series. And finally we have the oldest sister, Hazuki who was studying law before the incident with the sisters; she’s your typical hot-headed girl who says everything that comes to her mind.Despite its duration, the series is really good at actually making character development of the sisters, Hozuki, for once, starts as a really shy and timid girl but becomes a really solid thinker and strong character towards the end. Kazuki starts off really childish but starts making really mature decisions for the sisters and even cooking for them and eventually accepts the difficult condition that the sisters are in and finally Hazuki who also shows some development throughout the series, she starts as really hot headed girl who I honestly thought to be kind of annoying but she becomes this “shield” to the sisters, trying as hard as she can to protect them from any harm.I don’t know if it’s just me, but these are the major changes I noticed over the course of this anime regarding to the sisters and I think that one of the objectives of the series was for the psychological growth of the sisters as their journey to find the moon sketches and the Galileo Tesoro occurs. These changes are also really gradual and hardly noticeable from episode to episode.As far as the art goes, I can say that one of the things that I liked the most about this series was the art, it was honestly superb, the characters were really well drawn, the art was colorful and solid, the mechas also were really fluid with nice animation and the backgrounds were simply beautiful.The sound was also not bad at all, both the OP and ED are catchy and the BGM is also blend really nicely with the scenes but since the sound if not really my specialty I might be a little biased here, but overall I think it was good.In sum, Galilei Donna is BY NO MEANS a bad show and with the little time it had it managed to bring a decent story with characters that get new mindsets as the show progresses and that also brings a really nice ending with not much questions unanswered as far as I can tell.If you’re looking for a quick show with decent plot, interesting and diverse characters, one badass of an antagonist and colorful and gorgeously designed mechas then recommended you to check this one out; it’s also relatively short so it won’t take you much time to actually complete it.Thanks for reading. around the world gathering Moon Sketches left by Galileo with the objective of discovering the Galileo’s Tesoro and avoid the people targeting the sisters from actually getting it first.After watching all the episodes I can say that the plot execution is not perfect, however, it’s not horrid or even mediocre like most of the people around here seem to think, it has its flaws and a few plot holes here and there but it isn’t by all means unwatchable and I’ve watched really really worse things that didn’t get rated as low as I’ve seen around here.Now that I got this out of the way, let’s get to the characters shall we?The main characters, the three sisters aren’t by all means you stereotypical sisters, they’re all really different from each other and all of them want different things.

That is, no familiarity whatsoever with the source material (this is a TV original, so no issues there), or with the production staff or writers or any other personnel. This was a series I picked up ""blind"" at the start of the season and finished when it finished.So just how did Galilei Donna end up being? If you want the short answer, it would be to both anime enthusiasts and casual watchers alike, “don’t bother.”But I wouldn’t be doing...this right if I didn’t go into further detail. Let us go through the various aspects in order and then summarize at the end.The StoryThree sisters who are alternate-history Galileo\'s descendants, Hozuki, Kazuki, Hazuki learn of some kind of long-lost treasure of Galileo\'s and realize some evil energy corporation is also after it. After a rather violent disruption to their daily lives, they are forced to go on a journey to try to search for clues as to its identity and location before the evil company and some sky-faring pirates get their hands on it. So far, so good. It\'s a rather generic-sounding fetch quest or mystery/adventure story, but it has some potential in the right hands.Unfortunately, the execution of the story is absolutely abysmal. It\'s like the writers thought the series needed a ""treasure"" mystery for the adventure to even occur in the first place, but all they were looking for was some kind of somewhat urgent situation with which to burden the delicate character of Hozuki such that she could look sort of moe while working her child-prodigy engineering magic (more on that later).Whereas a classic mystery/adventure formula features (reluctantly or not) daring protagonists (again, more on that later) on a journey to solve some kind of puzzle by finding clues, and struggling against being set back by misdirection or other various conflicts, in Galilei Donna the pervading sense is that the story merely was an excuse to get the girls from one perilous action sequence to another with the ""sketches"" of Galileo as some kind of checkpoint.Not once did I ever sense any kind of concern as to where the location of the next checkpoint would be, or what kind of puzzle they would have to solve to get their hands on it once the location was identified. In fact, in one particular instance, they randomly and inexplicably land in some far-off location I have since forgotten for reasons I didn\'t pick up on, and a strange hobo hands them a clue because he happened to have it.And then it all concludes in the most inane, drama-less courtroom drama that I have ever seen onscreen. After giving us an entire show featuring about three girls on the run from an evil corporation and sky-pirates that clearly have very few scruples about killing or destroying to get what they want, the writers have the evil corporation arrest the girls and put them on trial...for stealing some of their precious energy source from them. Huh?Note to writers: If your genre is mystery/adventure, put some mystery into your adventure, and have the climax of the show feature some kind of mystery-solving or at least a climactic battle for a long-lost treasure, please. It doesn\'t really count as a story if the protagonists accidentally stumble from clue to clue as though they were predefined checkpoints along a linear path, and then suddenly show up in a courtroom to defend themselves against a corporation that would probably just have killed them, anyway.Throughout Galilei Donna, I am sorry to say, I was continuously baffled by the inexplicable sequence of events that followed one after another with barely any thread of plot stringing them together. Story: 2/10The ArtTo be honest, Galilei Donna was mostly a pleasure to look at. While a lot of the scenery was fairly generic, which made it seem like the writers did painfully little Google image searching for pictures of Italy, the action sequences were well-animated, and the character designs were unique and pleasant enough for this kind of show. In particular, Hozuki’s (Hocchi, Hocchibi) design was a high point.In addition, the weapons, missile/rocket spam, the usual blingy computer displays, explosion effects, and other noticeably 3D-animated sequences were pretty well-done. This contributed to the general sense of fluidity and competence in the action sequences, of which there were plenty.For the most part, the visuals delivered. However, there were a few very puzzling decisions that I could not shake off for the entire series, namely, why does alternate-future Italy look so Japanese, and more importantly, why was everything a fish?These rather irksome questions were enough to cause me to actually laugh when I should have been riveted to the screen watching air-to-air missile combat during tense dogfights. Instead, what we got was...fish-fights? What?In conclusion, this was a competently produced and animated show, with some odd design decisions that fell rather flat, and others that had some amount of charm to them. Art: 7/10The SoundThe voice-acting in Galilei Donna was mediocre to decent. In particular, the three main girls had some decent amount of differentiation, though I wouldn’t go so far as to say they really had “personality,” but good enough. The minor characters were all reasonable well-acted as well, with relatively little “ham” or overly-dramatically delivered dialogue, except possibly for the sky pirate Cicinho, whose penchant for calling Hazuki “bambina” grew old very fast.The opening and closing songs did their job and didn’t get too much in the way. Though I still remain puzzled as to their relation to the actual content of the series, they were competently sung and decently composed songs. I had no qualms about either, but they didn’t really stand out to me either. Sound effects in general were perfectly adequate, as were backing music tracks, but once again, neither particularly stood out to me.A competent showing but not a particularly outstanding effort from the sound department. Sound: 6/10The CharactersUnfortunately things get really bad when it comes to the characters. Though it is easy to nitpick over the incredibly lackluster cast of villains and side characters, in the interest of time and space, I will focus on the protagonists.Hozuki, Kazuki, and Hazuki are, respectively, an unfailingly cute child prodigy engineer, a rather pessimistic and grouchy teenager who...complains a lot, and a college-age law student (which, as you know by now, really only matters a single time at the end of the show). The girls are part-Japanese, which seems be the case simply to give the writers a convenient excuse to have the main characters speak Japanese and visit Japan when they feel like it.Supposedly, this show is about their adventure together and the relationship between these sisters who don’t seem to get along very well. So by the end, they should have grown both personally and interpersonally; that is, as individual people and in their relationships with each other. Well, it is certainly true that by the end of the show they got used to living together with each other and their companion Anna Hendrix in a cramped (but surprisingly stable and comfortable-looking) flying goldfish.However, do not be fooled.Although we are treated to occasional squabbles over trivial matters in life aboard a flying goldfish, and then occasional moments where the evil corporation, pirates, or other struggles force them to work together, never do we really see their relationships advance. Instead it seems that, simply by virtue of having been through some troubling times together, the sisters now know each other somewhat better, and have decided that they really are a family. Aw...that’s so...touchingly obvious?Well, whatever. I guess lack of relationship developments is all right so long each character has some kind of depth or personality or internal struggle she has to work out. Unfortunately, this is not the case either.Hozuki doesn’t really have anything to her. Beyond being an adorable pre-teen with genius-level engineering skills, there is literally no depth to her character. She doesn’t even have an internal struggle to make up for it, unless you count “missing” her ancestor Galileo.Kazuki, much in the same vein, is an angsty teenage girl, and that seems to be her entire character. I guess there is some unrequited crush or something but this is never really explored, just literally tossed aside at the end (symbolism!!). Her entire character seems to exist to complain about what the other two girls are doing.Meanwhile, Hazuki seems to struggle with being hit on by a space pirate...oh, and I guess she’s the eldest and has some responsibility or something. Too bad doesn’t really have time to shoulder all that responsibility until the courtroom drama sequence and she...well, gets saved by her parents anyway. Sigh...so much for that.Flat and uninteresting personalities, complete with generic and boring character concepts leads to a pretty dull cast. Characters: 2/10EnjoymentWell, you might have already sensed that I didn’t enjoy this show terribly much, and you’d be right. It was entertaining, mildly, to see this trainwreck of a show (shipwreck? fishwreck?) play out, all the while holding a glimmer of hope that something really astounding might occur to turn the show around. And, I guess it wasn’t an eyesore or too hard on the ears.Still, though, “not annoying visually or audibly” is not enough to actually say I enjoyed something. If maybe I had cared for any of the content of the show, I would have enjoyed it more, but really, this was a vapid, forgettable piece of animation. Enjoyment: 3/10ConclusionIn conclusion, some technically strong points lead to a watchable show that unfortunately has little to nothing in the way of content. This is a classic example of a show that tried too hard in all the wrong ways to be original or surprisingly, and ended up really just rehashing some clichéd story with some wooden characters, and then dressing it up in a different outfit or something.Overall: 4/10 this right if I didn’t go into further detail.

She doesn’t even have an internal struggle to make up for it, unless you count “missing” her ancestor Galileo.Kazuki, much in the same vein, is an angsty teenage girl, and that seems to be her entire character. I guess there is some unrequited crush or something but this is never really explored, just literally tossed aside at the end (symbolism!!). Her entire character seems to exist to complain about what the other two girls are doing.Meanwhile, Hazuki seems to struggle with being hit on by a space pirate...oh, and I guess she’s the eldest and has some responsibility or something. Too bad doesn’t really have time to shoulder all that responsibility until the courtroom drama sequence and she...well, gets saved by her parents anyway. Sigh...so much for that.Flat and uninteresting personalities, complete with generic and boring character concepts leads to a pretty dull cast. Characters: 2/10EnjoymentWell, you might have already sensed that I didn’t enjoy this show terribly much, and you’d be right. It was entertaining, mildly, to see this trainwreck of a show (shipwreck? fishwreck?) play out, all the while holding a glimmer of hope that something really astounding might occur to turn the show around. And, I guess it wasn’t an eyesore or too hard on the ears.Still, though, “not annoying visually or audibly” is not enough to actually say I enjoyed something. If maybe I had cared for any of the content of the show, I would have enjoyed it more, but really, this was a vapid, forgettable piece of animation. Enjoyment: 3/10ConclusionIn conclusion, some technically strong points lead to a watchable show that unfortunately has little to nothing in the way of content. This is a classic example of a show that tried too hard in all the wrong ways to be original or surprisingly, and ended up really just rehashing some clichéd story with some wooden characters, and then dressing it up in a different outfit or something.Overall: 4/10', 'Galilei Donna was a fabulous anime overall. Many people have said the ending is ""the beginning"" and in a way that\'s true. The reason why some people were unhappy with this anime was because it seemed a little rushed at the end and there was supposedly ""so much more of the story untold"".The characters seem like the typical type, sisters all with different talents and passions who work together to complete some big task. In this case it was recovering all the Moon sketches. I liked the characters though, they were funny and all really helped the plot.The art in my opinion was...really good. It was vibrant and colourful.I loved the opening and ending songs as well, very catchy.I think the ending was just fine because the major tasks were all completed and it was the whole happy ending and the rest is left to your imagination.Overall, very enjoyable and I think having the whole Galileo thing in the plot was very nice as well. really good.

Unfortunately it never establishes a believable or consistent tone and it feels like the writers were really struggling to bring it all together, so even when they have good ideas, they were awkwardly executed.  Plot stuff seems to happen not for logical reasons, but because it has to happen to wrap everything up.The first two episodes were really good... the rest did not live up to the high standards set by those early episodes.  I'm not the only one that had that reaction,...a lot of people on the forum said they only stuck with the show because of the strength of the first episode.  I'll probably be re-watching the first episode to reflect on how strong it was. a lot of people on the forum said they only stuck with the show because of the strength of the first episode.  I'll probably be re-watching the first episode to reflect on how strong it was."", ""Note: This is not spoiler free. Particularly, all the plot elements of the last episode are discussed freely as a point criticism.This series has become a staple of my anime repertoire as the perfect example of how good setup can end up in massive disappointment.It started out incredibly promising. The potential for the development of the three Galileo sisters fulfilling their different niches in their relationship while undertaking an arduous journey ultimately proved unfulfilled, however.In fact, the only character explored out of the trio was the youngest, Hozuki, who arguably had the least room for development. Rather than playing to the strengths of the two...elder sisters, Kazuki and Hazuki, it was played on top of a romantic frame between her and her ancestor, Galileo Galilei (thanks to a time traveling plot device that was never explained), making her entire character not only mediocre to watch, but even a little weird.Here especially, the faults of the show become apparent. The two older sisters were, for all intents and purposes, completely useless. After being introduced in the first few episode, their characters remained stagnant and bland.Kazuki, being shown doing martial arts in the opening sequence (or was it the ending?), and performing a take down of a much larger man in the early episodes, was never developed along these character strengths. Instead, she remained as a voice of disagreement and home-sickness against the other two, stronger-willed sisters. At the most, her development consisted of a short sequence showing her phone breaking and her finally giving up on her romantic interests towards a character that was never shown for more than 5 minutes in the entire series. I'm not even sure what this was supposed to represent. Her newfound pride and respect for her family? Were we ever supposed to care about her love interests in the first place - so much so that we viewers were expected to feel some sort of emotion during the final episode where he rejected her and viewed her as a criminal? If so, the show failed miserably in this aspect.Hazuki, on the other hand, is quickly presented as a sort of justice compass for the group. It is also here where she remains throughout the story - simply pointing the direction to the very obvious 'right' choices. We never see why she had such strong emotions towards the idea of 'justice' nor the reason why she'd let her schooling career nearly fail. She simply just is, with no context, the way she is. Honestly, the most important thing she did was bring Anna into the picture.Ignoring the rest of characters, who all have varying degrees of unexplained motivations, we finally get to the series finale. This episode can be summed up in three words: Deus Ex Machina. We see the mother reveal her faking her amnesia. We watch the friendly sky pirate reveal himself as their senile old lawyer after taking off his facemask. And finally, we are left stunned (in a bad way) as Roberto shoots and kills his father for literally no reason. And that's the series. The final episode perfectly summarizes everything you need to know about this series in a 20 minute package.Granted, as it was originally plotted out to be twice the episode length, perhaps many of these faults were simply due to the lack of time. This however does not excuse the poorly written story - there have been plenty of excellent anime that have filled out an eleven episode shell.If there is one good thing I have to say about this series, it was that the art and scenery were colorful, delightful, and solidly above average. elder sisters, Kazuki and Hazuki, it was played on top of a romantic frame between her and her ancestor, Galileo Galilei (thanks to a time traveling plot device that was never explained), making her entire character not only mediocre to watch, but even a little weird.Here especially, the faults of the show become apparent.

I\'ll list my complaints in the beginning then mention the plot score and character score.Complaints:There were times when I was watching this anime, and I felt things do get repetitive. The whole evil corporation after them though many of the episodes. HOWEVER, this is part of the plot and I very much enjoyed how the girls had to visit several different countries with different settings to get the sketches. I would have enjoyed the anime a tiny bit more if they changed up some of the...action a little. The BIGGEST COMPLAINT is that there are plot holes in the anime. One episode I wondered, ""Well if their mecha was just severely damaged, and it looked like it would never fly again...how is it able to fly in the air after crashing into the ground?"" It\'s pretty easy to say that the youngest girl probably might have done quick repairs or something, but it just goes unexplained.Plot Score 7So the plot is about three of Galileo\'s descendants who are part Italian and Japanese. The world is in an energy crisis and the girls are sudden charged for being the culprits. This results in them going on a quest to hunt down moon sketches left behind by Galileo in order to discover what his inheritance is that everyone wants. The plot is totally original in the sense with the whole Galileo quest and being his descendants. Though this anime is more adventure, then followed by action, I did enjoy how they managed to put hinted romances in the anime.Characters Score 7I liked how each sister had a different personality. The youngest is a happy-cute girl who has an amazing ability to build stuff (The Mecha Fish, a stun gun, an energy adapter), then you have the middle child who is denying the whole situation and simply wants to return home. The oldest child is in law school, with the dreams of becoming a lawyer to uphold the law. By the end of the anime, the youngest has become braver, the middle child has learned to accept everything and has a strong resolve to want to protect her family, and the oldest has learned to use what she knows as an aspiring lawyer to help her family out. action a little.

The characters would move from one location to the next looking for the Moon Sketches. The problem with this format is that it gets quite repetitive and some scenes feel needlessly rushedArt 8/10The art was beautiful. Some of the ""mecha"" (using this word REALLY lightly) is creepy at times but overall the art was a pleasure to look atSound 7/10Nothing special. The music completes the atmosphere nicely and isn\'t overwhelming....Character 5/10Here I have a REALLY big problem. Hazuki and Hozuki (Law and mech) sisters were enjoyable to watch but they were rather flat as they receive hardly any development. Kazuki does get development, however her wimpy character makes her very unlikeable. Anna gets a tiny bit of character development and is somewhat likeable but the rest of the supporting cast are flat, clique and awfully designed.Enjoyment 6/10Although the show does not have any super strong points it was something nice to watch, contrasting between the action/drama heavy animes like Valvrave and Golden TimeEnding 3/10*No Spoilers* but that ending -_-Overall 6/10The first few episodes seemed to have tons of potential, but this show did not realize half of it. The later half quickly descended into a train wreck. Character 5/10Here I have a REALLY big problem.

So, three sisters are going on a quest, pursued by an evil corporation and some colourful pirates, right? ""It\'s fine"", I say, ""it\'s normal for anime premises to sound a bit goofy, and the universe looks like it has great potential"". So I decided to give it a chance, in the hopes of some good fun, drama, character development and all of that jazz - indeed I got my hopes up in such a way as the show progressed: At a point, it looked like...the characters were set for some interesting exploration and evolution individually and collectively. Moreover, I was impressed by the tone of two adjacent episodes in the mid-point in which things became pretty serious all of the sudden with some new, darker themes introduced. I believed I might have found a hidden gem, that the sisters\' relationship and personalities would be explored satisfyingly, that I would be fearing for their safety in crises and filled with good feelings when they succeeded. Yes, I sensed the tendrils of that goosebump-worthy anime magic that can bump up my ratings of any series creeping their way around GD.Yet none of these ever happened. The show didn\'t reach nearly as far or as high as I had hoped, and the bad aspects that were apparent near the beginning only inflated towards the end, snuffing out any magic that might have been had. The characters fly around wielding plot armour and using lazily frequent mechanical hocus pocus, the dialogue gets dull, whilst ridiculous or boring events become the show\'s bread and butter. Interesting character developments are dealt with in only the most rudimentary and unsubtle manner, and once Kozuki is done it would be generous to say that they slow to a trickle - including one of the most mediocre villains I\'ve ever encountered in anime. The plot and story all but collapse in the final three episodes, culminating in a conclusion devoid of pacing, drama, intensity, emotion, depth or anything that might carry the viewer with it. GD never sets out to be funny, but combined with the above defects it doesn\'t really have much going for it sadly, just a kind of watered down, lukewarm averageness.Alright, maybe I\'m being a bit harsh. On the technical side, you\'ll be able to expect a fantastic OP which was a pleasure to watch each time, with the rest of the score and ED being pretty decent. The expressions and animation are decent, while the costumes and mechas are a noticeable strong point. The main strength of this show are the pleasant, positive moments between the characters that surface quite often, as the dark ones are quite rare. They\'re simple, and in no way exceptional, but they keep the show together and make it somewhat enjoyable on a basic level. And yet, when I think about other shows that I\'ve given four stars and how much I enjoyed them in comparison, the overall result comes a bit closer to a 2 than to a 3 star rating for me. I can see why people might enjoy it, but if you don\'t like the idea of investing a good amount of time in something that turns out to be kind of dull, I hope you find my feedback helpful. Whatever the case, I find this all a big shame because it\'s clear that the people who worked on this gave it an honest go to make it worthwhile/special, and if they happen to bring out an OVA, I\'ll give it a fair chance.4/10 the characters were set for some interesting exploration and evolution individually and collectively.

That is exactly the problem with Galilei Donna, while the series is pretty enjoyable to a start it gets more and more notable that the shows pacing and development took a severe hit because it was limited to an 11 episode series.Galilei Donna tells the story of the Ferrari sisters as they travel the world searching for Galileo Gelileis lost sketches,...the series tries to to fill itself with stories of sisterly love, loyalty, emotion, corruption and drama but it's all once again let down by lack of development and rushed plot points.It also sports a big cast of characters who all could have been great but in the end became one of its biggest faults. All the characters except the main sister gets very rushed or overly convenient development, which is sad since at times the series shows how great it is but because it needs to fit the 11 episode margin, the pacing, development and tone was all over the place.Also in terms of story it feels like it just played out just like you though it would. The story takes no risks nor does it do something amazing, it started out as a journey story and played out just like one. For you people who wishes for something mind blowing, you will be disappointed especially since the series shows signs of being able to be much more.Though I would still give this series a recommendation since the animation is superb. A-1 Pictures are certainly great animators and the CGI used withing the show is seamless blended in, reminding me of series like Last Exile. The character designs and art direction is gorgeous and is probably among A-1 Pictures best work with a really wonderful cinematic orchestral soundtrack that accompanies the series perfectly.All in all it's a rather lackluster series for what it's trying to pull off but even with what it's trying to pull off it wouldn't have been anything fantastic but still quite enjoyable for it's beautiful production values. If you want something to enjoy while not thinking to much give Galilei Donna a go.P.s Hazuki is like cutest thing ever. the series tries to to fill itself with stories of sisterly love, loyalty, emotion, corruption and drama but it's all once again let down by lack of development and rushed plot points.It also sports a big cast of characters who all could have been great but in the end became one of its biggest faults.

The world now depends on methane hydrate for fuel and is desperate for new power sources. Enter our protagonists, three descendants of Galileo, who in this world is held in regard akin to Einstein. A chaotic series of events forces these three, very different, girls to work together and find Galileo\'s inheritance.This adventure is a short but interesting ride with some pretty unique themes and an interesting take on history. I definitely don\'t recommend using this as a...last ditch guide for AP History as other than Galileo\'s rejection of the Heliocentric universe model and his sketches of the moon, nothing is historically correct. If you\'re looking for a relatively tame sci-fi adventure with a fairly interesting setting, give this a go.Animation:Galilei Donna is nicely drawn with nice coloring and adequate backgrounds and shading. There is heavy CGI usage for the mechs, which annoys but doesn\'t detract too severely from the experience. While the atmosphere isn\'t anywhere near as rich as Kaminai, the setting is interesting in its own way. The world is convincingly depicted as a cold, bleak place. I found myself having difficulties placing a date at which the series takes place; old cottages and villages seem like an anachronism next to flying mechs and almost-sentient AI - very similar in nature to parts of Fractale.As for character styling, A-1 pictures definitely does a good job here presenting a varied and unique cast. Hozuki definitely hits the moe mark with almost Kyoto Animation levels of accuracy. Characters using their hair as a pocket is also a novel if rather (realistically) cumbersome technique.There is quite a bit of action in this show with a lot of mecha-based missile and gun spamming battles as well as rampant killing in the everyone-for-themselves fight for resources. There is definitely a supernatural or magical aspect to Galileo\'s gifts, which (maybe for the better) is never explained. Don\'t expect much ecchi with this predominantly female cast.Sound:The show starts with an ambient, light rock piece. It\'s a bit of an odd piece with a meandering melody, but fits overall with the tonality of the series. The ED is a pleasant, uplifting piece; one that invokes a ""hope for a better tomorrow"" feeling. The BGM doesn\'t stand out as much. It is used frequently enough but the orchestration lacked cohesion and identity, utilizing way too many different instruments.The VA cast is composed of relatively fresh talent with the exception of Marina Inoue. The main cast does a fair job overall though I have harsh criticism for the antagonists who are given the standard villain voice, totally killing any chance for depth of character. The standout for this show for me is the humorous, smooth, and witty AI voiced by Misaki Kuno.Story:The plot follows the Ferrari sisters as they drive, er... fly around searching for Galileo\'s inheritance, whatever that is. They find clues in Galileo\'s paintings, which for some reason are scattered around the world much like Dragonballs. Along the way, they bump into rowdy sky pirates and are constantly harassed by a corporate army led by an emotionless assassin. It\'s a fairly engaging story overall with quite a few tense moments, so much so that you actually grow weary of the story selling how the girls have yet again cheated death. The story has one main central plot thread that builds to a final climax in the final episode, where all the pieces are neatly tied into a cohesive knot. The story did a great job giving foreshadowing that, for once, didn\'t give away too much.There were also small touches to the story that helped differentiate it among the crowd. First off, there is a constant theme of goldfishes. Hozuki is obsessed with them and apparently others were as well. There is actually a purpose behind all the fishy madness but the story conceals it well until the tail end of the show. Another noticeable point is Hozuki\'s obsession with Japan. The sisters are half Japanese, but they talk about Japan and its culture in such quantity that you\'d half think this was sponsored by the Japanese tourism board.Despite the many positive qualities in this production, there were definitely significant holes and underdeveloped aspects. Though some may blame it on the short length of the show, I counter that there are plenty of shorter works that have more complete executions. In many ways, this is one of those stories where thinking is only going to be detrimental to your overall enjoyment. Yes, it doesn\'t quite make sense historically for Galileo to have discovered flying. Yes, it seems impractical for a pre-teen to have built a flying mech the size of a house without anyone noticing, and possessing a spirited AI for that matter. And yes, it seems completely illogical for a huge conglomerate to target three girls over a completely unproven hunch. Accept these as given faults and go on enjoying the other aspects of the show.Character:The weakest elements of the story are compounded by the underdevelopment of key characters. There is little exposition in the story, it basically thrusts you into the middle of the action immediately. I seriously question the decision to show the antagonist\'s past over that of the main protagonists. You get why the antagonist has no emotions but struggle to understand the sisters and the decisions they make. This is made even worse by the fact that the protagonists are supposed to be dynamic; growth is hard to measure when only given a vague starting point. Sure, the sisters and escorts are lively and have semblances of personality. But Hozuki aside, you never really get a chance to know the others. And that\'s a real shame since you aren\'t terribly attached when their life is in jeopardy. Likewise, despite the exposition, expect cookie cutter antagonist personalities with no depth.Value:I had little expectations coming in to this show, and likewise recommend that you do the same. This is not going to be the standout show of the season, but it definitely is one of the better, if relatively obscure, adventure-based shows. The plot continuity and successful integration of themes definitely helped in overlooking the woeful lack of character focus and development. last ditch guide for AP History as other than Galileo\'s rejection of the Heliocentric universe model and his sketches of the moon, nothing is historically correct.

Yes, it doesn\'t quite make sense historically for Galileo to have discovered flying. Yes, it seems impractical for a pre-teen to have built a flying mech the size of a house without anyone noticing, and possessing a spirited AI for that matter. And yes, it seems completely illogical for a huge conglomerate to target three girls over a completely unproven hunch. Accept these as given faults and go on enjoying the other aspects of the show.Character:The weakest elements of the story are compounded by the underdevelopment of key characters. There is little exposition in the story, it basically thrusts you into the middle of the action immediately. I seriously question the decision to show the antagonist\'s past over that of the main protagonists. You get why the antagonist has no emotions but struggle to understand the sisters and the decisions they make. This is made even worse by the fact that the protagonists are supposed to be dynamic; growth is hard to measure when only given a vague starting point. Sure, the sisters and escorts are lively and have semblances of personality. But Hozuki aside, you never really get a chance to know the others. And that\'s a real shame since you aren\'t terribly attached when their life is in jeopardy. Likewise, despite the exposition, expect cookie cutter antagonist personalities with no depth.Value:I had little expectations coming in to this show, and likewise recommend that you do the same. This is not going to be the standout show of the season, but it definitely is one of the better, if relatively obscure, adventure-based shows. The plot continuity and successful integration of themes definitely helped in overlooking the woeful lack of character focus and development.']"

Garakuta-doori no Stain,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3519/Garakuta-doori_no_Stain,"['From the creator of Popee the Performer was all I needed to know about Mr. Stain on Junk Alley to give it a shot. The more time passes, the more I realise how truly original, inspired and deeply traumatising Popee was. Mr. Stain has a lot of the same stylistic choices. It’s entirely CG animated with rather creepy shiny faced character models. There’s no spoken dialogue, with only the odd musical cue and recycled sound bites used. Each episode is only 5 minutes long and features some truly bizarre imagery. The big difference between the two is while Popee is about the darker side of...humanity with jealousy, sadism and hatred, Mr. Stain is about compassion and love, albeit sometimes a rather creepy desperate form of love involving paintings and flowers.The story is about Stain, a homeless dude living in an alleyway full of rubbish and follows his escapades as he rifles through the seemingly endless piles of junk to find strange artefacts. As a general rule, the weirder the item Stain finds, the better the episode will turn out, which isn’t as often as I would like it. A big part of this comes from the animation not really working if you’re not going to go properly surreal. The characters look vaguely nightmarish with their bug-eyes and unreal movements, which is used intentionally in Popee to make you feel uneasy while Stain tries to tug on your heartstrings. While Stain’s grasp on reality is loose at best, unless it goes truly bizarre the episode rarely leaves much of an impact.When it does go truly strange though, it works magnificently. I prefer the idea that Stain doesn’t actually have any of the adventures the episodes show him having. He’ll find a dead bird and them in his hunger-driven state will concoct a story involving him tending to this bird’s ailments and building it a shelter. When taking this in mind, the formula works better when some of the darker desires of Stain comes through in the stories. My personal favourite was the one where he grew his own plant lady and spent their nights dancing on the rooftop as aliens flew in overhead and blew up the city. Or where sentient clay takes over the body of his cat and now Stain has a friend in the same shape as himself. These reflect his desires for romance but seen through his equally strong desire for some form of life and green in his dingy alley, or alternatively his desire for friendship but with someone much like himself instead of with his cat.Mr Stain 2As I said before though, Stain is not nearly weird enough. Apart from one truly strange scene involving a black hole forming in the centre of a cat’s face, the show never made me truly pull a  0_0 face while Popee managed this reaction at least once per episode, usually more. They’re obviously different types of shows. Popee uses the weirdness for dark comedy, while Mr. Stain uses it to show the main character’s compassion. But the weirder it got, the more impactful the compassion through this bizarre view of the world became. It could have been even better than Popee because Stain has heart that does manage to get to you. Well OK, Popee has heart too, but it’s a blackened dead heart while Stain gives you feels.That said, this director still has a great grasp of storytelling, and there’s a huge amount of imagination on show. The voiceless characters means they over-exagurate everything, but what’s great is how it shows emotion in the non-human characters. The glove that’s trying to rescue the lost little girl, or the robot who just wants people to dance with him. It’s that same Pixar style of emotion through non-human characters that makes it work, even when the character is a flower with very long attractive legs that is merely the concoction of a homeless man’s longing sex-drive mixed deliriously with his gardening hobby. I did enjoy the show quite a bit, and it’s certainly an easier starting point to this man’s style than Popee is, which is like introducing you to swimming by throwing you into the mouth of a basking shark.

Each story generally revolves something that Stain finds in the said junk alley and how it affects everyone within the junk alley. The stories are all told clearly and are quite inventive and fun to watch play out.Art will most likely be a love it or hate it relationship as it is entirely in CGI. The CGI is clear and the series knows exactly what it wants to do with it's graphics, but sometimes they also come off as a tad creepy (particularly in the final...episode). The animation is completely smooth and clean however, always a plus. It doesn't have tons of detail like we've come to expect from movies like Shrek, but it didn't bite off more than it could chew either. There is some god-awful CGI out there, luckily, this clearly avoids that category. Sound fits and there's not too much in the way of music, but nothing feels out of place for the sake of having pretty music, it all fits the tone of the series pretty well. There isn't any voice acting except for occasional laughs or other basic noises so there's not much to critique there. For the series it works well, but it's nothing special either and it certainly wouldn't work so well elsewhere.Mr. Stain is not a series afraid of injuring its own characters and it does so quite often in a mix of slapstick and entirely deserved pitch black humor. In some cases, you do feel a little bad for the characters when they've been injured a little too much or for unfair reasons. In fact, the presence of the pitch black humor added to my enjoyment, as it is one of my favorite types of humor. Mr. Stain is not a series that takes itself too seriously and spends its time trying to shove preachy lessons in your face, it's there for entertainment. It's a short if not completely fun series that doesn't overstay its welcome by being far too long either. The enjoyment value is quite high if you know what to expect (which is not a long string of anvils falling on head comedy). Mr. Stain has its touching moments and uses them quite well, it actually hits a good mix between comedy and making you curious about what will happen to the plot and characters, more so than you'd initially expect.

The creator really did do a good job in making each unique object into something that can tell a story because you never know what will happen.The show itself can be rather violent, pretty...much every episode feature Stain being hurt in some way giving him various bruises and cuts and there is always blood, this is a touch that might make you go 'what the fuck' because you simply don't expect it to happen in this type of show, granted you get used to it, but it all adds to the uniqueness that makes it all the more enjoyable.It's created solely in CG but all the characters are cartoonified so they don't look too realistic but it does make the show quirky and the CG allows for great animation. What will become apparent is it seems the creators like dancing, there is a lot of dancing whether its just the ending credits or part of the episode, the dances are pretty cool and funky and the music that accompanied the credits is brilliant and catchy.Stain lives in a room but its not a house, im not really shore what it is and lives off eating doh nuts or what ever he kills, he also falls in love multiple times throughout the series with various things, a painting, a flower, a real girl, he gives off that feeling that makes you want to see him succeed in anything he does as he gets the short end of the stick a rather lot.

Gifuu Doudou!!: Kanetsugu to Keiji,https://myanimelist.net/anime/18771/Gifuu_Doudou__Kanetsugu_to_Keiji,"['If it weren\'t for two other particularly strong entries, Gifuu Doudou!!: Kanetsugu to Keiji—the double exclamation marks say it all, really—would probably be a strong contender for the most righteous show of the summer 2013 anime season. Gifuu Doudou!!\'s premise is simple: Naoe Kanetsugu and Maeda Keiji, two ridiculously large and powerful ""legitimate eccentrics,"" recount their exploits dispensing their brand of ""RIGHTEOUSNESS"" all over Sengoku-era Japan. It has the right attitude to make this sort of narrative funny and fun, clearly not taking itself very seriously with things like an over the top opening (entirely composed of recycled footage of course) named ""SAMURAI ROCK"" with...lines like ""come on come on come come on SAMURAI BABY"" in English and heavily, heavily caricatured depictions of most of its characters. When watched with friends this can all make for a very righteous (and enjoyable) experience.But don\'t get me wrong, this show is not very righteous (or good) in any traditional sense of the word. Gifuu Doudou!! is plagued by all sorts of problems, from its extremely low budget to its terrible writing and strawman characters. In the world of Gifuu Doudou!!, physical size roughly correlates to righteousness which roughly correlates to power.Most characters are not very big.Okay, so having our protagonists tower over all of the other characters in every scene can be fun if you are the sort of person who can look at that sort of absurdity with an appreciative attitude, but there is one aspect of this show that absolutely lacks righteousness: Gifuu Doudou!! hardly deserves to be called a piece of animation. Perhaps Studio DEEN decided that its money was better spent elsewhere, but this is one of the most plainly underfunded anime of recent years. Foreground characters rarely do much more than flap their mouths, background characters never even move, some episodes are almost entirely recycled footage from previous episodes, and most shots are slow pans across a still image or hilarious slow dramatic zoom-ins on some character\'s massive face. Most egregious, however, are the ""action"" scenes. Shirohata Bob, the director, generally does a good job of avoiding action whenever he can by just cutting to shots of bodies on the ground after the enemies have been dispatched (wouldn\'t want to have to draw too many frames). However, whenever he is forced to show actual combat, the result isn\'t pretty. Having the top of someone\'s body literally slide off of his stationary legs while an enormous quantity of horrible looking blood gushes out is bad enough, but even worse is when the director takes a still shot, overlays some diagonal lines, and literally just shakes it for about ten seconds in some sort of pathetic attempt to convey motion. I understand that you\'re working with approximately one frame every ten seconds, but please, Bob, please don\'t just shake the camera like that.If you have friends available to take along for the ride and the right kind of appreciation for absurdly over the top samurai-ninja-tiger-monks (Maeda.

The way the story is told to us makes it clear that the two main characters have survived whatever ordeals they faced, and the action itself is not nearly as kinetically satisfying, juicy or frequent as you get in lots of other anime, particularly ones that tend away from the moe side of the scale. Therefore, don't go into this expecting a huge amount of intensity, drama, action or gushing feels. Gifu Dodo is in essence a temperate tale told in smaller stories and adventures that tend to involve strategy, philosophy, courage and loyalty, all...imbibed with and pulled together by a theme of fraternal righteousness that actually has an effect unlike the best dialogue between characters many other shows have to offer. It somehow manages to do this without coming across as pretentious, most likely given the upbeat and ridiculous yet resolute tone embellished by some great, strong visuals and soundtrack. Though the show is for the most part extremely serious and can be taken as such, this actually makes it quite humorous too on the side. This is summarized aptly by the character of Uesugi Kagekatsu, the' man who has never smiled', who furrows his brow in such a manly way that it makes creaking sounds...Despite the humorousness of the exaggerated masculinity, the series is riddled with memorable scenes that are slowly and deliberately set up. It's soothingly anti-hyperactive material that you can really sit down to and appreciate at your pace, one episode at a time or several. The same can't be said of many superior animes, which often are either action from start to finish, or which unhappily lurch between this and filler episodes that fail to satisfy.Unfortunately, the budding brotherhood between Kanetsugu and Keiji, which by the midpoint of the show had evolved to become one of its main charms, was all but discarded for the second half. It starts to feel strange that Keiji only really has a presence in the opening and closing credits as well as the sake-drinking scenes of discussion with his friend in the present, given that the show seemed to be about the two of them rather than simply how awesome Kanetsugu is, and the plots around his origins. A host of side-characters file in and out of the episodes, but tend to fail at filling the gap left behind by the eccentric tiger-warrior, not least when they introduce a certain non-human character and give the slightly dull ninja a more central role. I'm not saying any of this to spoil anyone, but rather because I kept expecting Keiji to show up again during the second half, and my viewing experience suffered due to this never happening.Moreover, while I only have praise for the better scenes of this series, there is a lot of time in each episode filled by less impressive or interesting activity, which is a shame because it results in a test of patience that it would appear many potential viewers of this show weren't prepared to put up with. The theme of righteousness and exploration of various individuals' pursuit of it in their own ways is also somewhat dropped and altogether, despite the brilliant denouements in episodes 21 and 25, the second half of Gifu Dodo felt somewhat lacking in departments that it initially charmed me with.Still, it remains a great anime, its flaws being largely made up for by its exaggerated, uplifting, masculine charm. Feel like a change from screaming, teenaged protagonists, moe and hyperactiveness?

I'm not saying any of this to spoil anyone, but rather because I kept expecting Keiji to show up again during the second half, and my viewing experience suffered due to this never happening.Moreover, while I only have praise for the better scenes of this series, there is a lot of time in each episode filled by less impressive or interesting activity, which is a shame because it results in a test of patience that it would appear many potential viewers of this show weren't prepared to put up with. The theme of righteousness and exploration of various individuals' pursuit of it in their own ways is also somewhat dropped and altogether, despite the brilliant denouements in episodes 21 and 25, the second half of Gifu Dodo felt somewhat lacking in departments that it initially charmed me with.Still, it remains a great anime, its flaws being largely made up for by its exaggerated, uplifting, masculine charm. Feel like a change from screaming, teenaged protagonists, moe and hyperactiveness? Kick back and watch Gifu Dodo.6.5/10"", 'First of all, I recomend everyone to read the manga ""Hana no Keiji"" before getting into this anime. Thing is that, like a reviewer on this anime here said, it is difficult for many to get into this anime. Reading the manga first will allow you to further understand the concept of this anime. With that said, let me express my review on Gifuu Doudou.Story: 6/10It was told that Uesugi Kenshin had illegitimate son. The great Shoguns Hideyoshi, Nobunaga and Ieyasu knew of this, but, however, prefer not to spill the news to everyone. The story centers on two legendary Sengoku warriors, Naoe Kanetsugu and...Maeda Keiji, and their battles through the Warring Kingdoms era. Kanetsugu was a great general serving Uesugi Kenshin and Keiji was an unrivaled samurai with amazing swordsmanship skills. So basically both of them attained a high rank among the Sengoku Period and the story is about how they\'ve attained such positions. Now, truth being told, the pace is slow. But really slow. It\'s more talk than action to be precise. The whole series are basically flashbacks of the two warriors. And there\'s a lot of talking here and talking there, so for those who prefer more action packed anime, then this might dissapoint you. However, in my case, I didn\'t mind because, like I said, I\'ve read the prequel manga and I clearly like the setting in here because I knew exactly what happened before. However, yes there should\'ve been less talk and more action. Also, Hana no Keiji had some great comedy moments. This anime tries sometimes but just fails in this aspect.Art 6/10The art is pretty good for its standards. However, the manga Hana no Keiji had better artwork and this anime fails to catch the epicness of its design. It\'s not as bad as the Fist of The Blue Sky anime adaptation, but I expected more to be honest. I could give it a 5 but I gave it a 6 because the character designs remind me a lot of Fist of The North Star (the manga\'s art was made by Tetsuo Hara, the sama mangaka of FOTNS).Sound: 8/10The soundtrack is great. It goes from a relaxing japanese melody and then you hear some epic battle music when the action comes. The opening ""Samurai Rock"" is really catchy.Character: 7/10I have a mixed opinion about this one, but I gave it a 7. Having read Hana no Keiji, I knew who Maeda Keiji was and how epic he was, but this anime did not show enough character development of Kanetsugu. He\'s just the typical good guy in the flashbacks and nothing changed much in his present self. Keiji too had almost none character development here in this anime, but if you read the prequel manga, you\'ll understand how epic Maeda Keiji is. The rest of the roster is forgetable, the anime only focuses more on these two warriors.Enjoyment: 7/10Despite its flaws, this anime is still MANLY! I mean those character designs, masculine attitudes, manly tears, dramatic stories, epic confrontations in the past... It\'s just MANLY! Like I said, the pace is slow and that\'s why I give this a 7.Overall: 7/10Like I said, the pace is slow and that\'s why I give this a 7. Please read the ""Hana No Keiji"" manga first before watching this anime, otherwise you\'ll watch 2 or 3 episodes and you\'ll become bored out of your minds. But if you like manly anime with tall muscular men, with drama and manly tears, then give it a go. Maeda Keiji, and their battles through the Warring Kingdoms era. Kanetsugu was a great general serving Uesugi Kenshin and Keiji was an unrivaled samurai with amazing swordsmanship skills.

Gravity Daze The Animation: Ouverture,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33697/Gravity_Daze_The_Animation__Ouverture,"['Short Answer: If you have played and liked the Gravity Rush games and want to see more of the characters, just watch this. You\'ll probably like it and its only 19 minutes long. If you have never played the games or don\'t particularly care for the characters then there\'s really no reason for you to watch it.This short animation was a nice connecting episode linking the two Gravity Rush games, and providing a little fanservice to the fans. It was released before the release of Gravity Rush 2 as promotional material. You get to see more of our favourite characters interacting with each other, which...is great because the characters in Gravity Rush are great. You also get to see how things ended up the way they are at the start of the Gravity Rush 2 game, which is nice because not everything gets clearly explained when you start it.This episode is actually made up of two mini parts.Part A is fairly boring in my opinion. It\'s pretty much just a 5 minute fight between Kat and some nevi, which I wasn\'t particularly interested in. The fight animation was pretty enough, though at the beginning you get to see some of the worst walking animation ever. There are a couple of nice character interactions between Kat and Raven through dialogue during the fight too, but overall part A doesn\'t really do anything or add anything to the Gravity Rush narrative. It simply exists to promote the new game and say, ""Look! It\'s Kat! You should look forward to her new game! Have a short animation!"" It also serves to briefly show you the setting of Gravity Rush 2 as it seems to take place partway through the game.I enjoyed part B more. The first couple of minutes are really nice. You get to see how close Kat and Raven get after the end of the first game. Theres some entertaining banter between the two in Kats house, which I love because my favourite part of the games were the characters. Then the episode starts to develop the mystery which builds up to the second game. It managed to get me invested in the short time the episode has. The part is rounded off with a nice fight scene (which I enjoyed much more than the pointless nevi fight in part A) and the episode ends on a cliffhanger. To find out how any of the plot of this is concluded, then you\'ll just have to play the games. Its pretty much just a mini prequel for GR2.In conclusion, its not a narrative masterpiece; what little story there is is barebones and just serves just to set up the stage for Gravity Rush 2. I like it because it gives you more of the characters we love. If you enjoy the games, whats there to complain about a nice little bit of extra content given in the form of a promotional episode.

Infini-T Force,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33027/Infini-T_Force,"['Note: This review only covers the 2017 TV series as the story continues with the 2018 movie. Infini-T Force is a superhero crossover featuring 1970’s superheroes from Tatsunoko Productions as a celebration for their 55th anniversary. However, the show is a mixed bag of content unable to properly balance its agenda while trying to incorporate 4 different superhero franchises & doesn’t do a good job in representing or explaining those characters to a new audience. Meanwhile fans that are familiar with these classic superheroes could be discouraged from watching the show given the different interpretations of said heroes. There are some redeemable factors to Infini-T...Force but not many for the established Tatsunoko fan.The show follows the story of a girl named Emi who’s suffering from suicidal thoughts & is neglected by her father. One day, 4 superheroes appear who help Emi face her life problems meanwhile 4 villains are destroying other dimensions while pursuing Emi who has an object they’re seeking called “The Case”; a magic pencil that can alter reality.My worry since the announcement of the anime in 2016 was this question. “Will Infini-T Force ruin 4 franchises or will it be able to respect each of their source material?” To my disappointment, Infini-T Force succeeds in representing only 1 hero out of 4. A big problem for this anime is using 4 different superhero series & 12 episodes aren’t enough to utilize the heroes to their full potential. Obvious evidence is the lack of proper introductions to a hero’s background as they each carry a lot of history with multiple anime adaptations. Within episodes 1 & 2 the main cast suddenly appear with very little explanation to their super powers, demeanor & their viewpoints of justice as if the show expects the audience to already know them.Infini-T Force features the following superheroes:Ken The Eagle from Gatchaman 1972. Previous English versions dubbed the series Battle Of The Planets, G FORCE, & Eagle Riders. (Gatchaman Crowds is a spin-off series unrelated to Ken The Eagle. ) Ken is the leader of the Science Ninja Team Gatchaman who use a bird theme for costumes & can be considered one of the earliest versions of Power Rangers. Ken the Eagle doesn’t have any super powers but uses various weapons such as Bird Run aka Birdarang & numerous ninja techniques. His personality during the 1st Gatchaman series depended heavily on sadness & anger as his father was killed by the terrorist organization Galactor. In later stories such as Gatchaman 2 & Gatchaman Fighter, Ken matures from his loss & becomes a dependable leader capable of taking charge & performing difficult life & death decisions. Within Infini-T Force Ken is in his leader state usually taking control of the team but also gets too much attention compared to the other characters. Emi spends the most time with Ken being the hero who ultimately helps solve her daddy issues.Casshan from Casshan 1973. Before Megaman, there was Azuma Tetsuya who participated in an experiment to become a new cyborg called a “Neoroider”/”Newly Built Man” to battle the robot army Andro Force led by Braiking Boss/Black King. Being mostly machine, Casshan has super physical prowess with electric attacks & the Super Destructive Beam. His dog Friender can breathe fire & transform into vehicles. (Friender doesn’t show these abilities in Infini-T Force). The original Casshan series is akin to a robot apocalypse where Casshan, his girlfriend Luna & his dog Friender are the only heroes fighting an entire army in a conquered world. Casshan also fights to rescue his mom & dad adding a very dramatic quest for the lone hero. Unlike the Casshan Robot Hunter OVA 1993 & Casshern Sins 2008, the original Casshan is a very emotional & encouraging heroic character who sacrificed his humanity for the world’s freedom acting as a symbol of hope. But those same people don’t like robots so Casshan is often prejudiced. Unfortunately, Infini- T Force uses a very emotionless version of Casshan who barely contributes much dialogue and is unsuccessful to create a sympathetic mood when compared to past adaptations.Hurricane Polymar from Hurricane Polymar 1974.  After a disagreement with his father Yoroi Takeshi runs away from home & works at the Kurama Detective Agency. Takeshi also comes in contact with the Polymet; a helmet that gives him superpowers of the “Spin Change”. With his martial arts background, Takeshi uses the Polymet to create a new martial art known as Hurricane Kenpo & with the Spin Change he can shapeshift into vehicles such as giant drill, a car, a plane, etc. Polymar is very hot blooded in the pursuit of beating up bad guys but his morals are a bit questionable given how violently he fights. In Infini-T Force Takeshi is not as energetic as his 70’s counterpart and comes off as very bi-shonen wanting to be friends with everyone in the world. Admittedly, he has the least depth from the 4 heroes but in the original series he at least cared to rescue his father, friends & civilians whenever he had the chance.Tekkaman from Tekkman 1975. (Tekkaman Blade is a reboot following different leading characters but similar story). Minami Jouji loses his father from the wrath of alien invaders known as The Waldaster. To battle these aliens Minami Jouji volunteers in the Tek Set experiment becoming Tekkaman The Space Knight. Armed with the Tek Lancer & Tek Whip, Tekkman can fire energy attacks from his forehead & fly with the help of his robot friend Pegas. (In the original Pegas was able to talk but is treated as an object in the Infini-T Force version.) In the 1975 story, Tekkaman was very young, angry & careless in his pursuit of ridding the Waldester but felt guilt when he accidently killed a family of innocent aliens. He was also racist towards Andro; a good alien who helped The Space Knights. As the story progressed, Tekkaman becomes friends with Andro putting their differences aside. His character in Infini-T Force is older and calmer than his 1975 version which shows an interesting display of maturity. While treated well within the show, regrettably Tekkaman has few scenes that allow him to show his growth as a man since Ken often takes the spotlight from other characters.Balance is difficult as Infini-T Force tries to juggle qualities aimed for two different age demographics; fans of the old shows & new viewers of modern times. While the anime initially draws the attention of the original fans by creating this superhero crossover it also displeases them with the “handsome” character redesigns when out of costume. It’s clearly an attempt to market the heroes as eye candy to the current generation of anime fans. While redesigns are welcomed to encourage more watchers, the characters don’t look & behave like their 1970’s sources. There’s several scenes depicting them as possible shipping partners for Emi to the point where it resembles a reverse harem especially when the 4 guys suddenly move in to her apartment.Many episodes alternate tone between a serious family drama, an epic superhero crossover and a slice of life female fantasy which all collide with each other. The worst aspects of it are the eating scenes as the series does a poor job in creating conversations. When things aren’t in a serious scene most of the time is spent on characters dining. This can work as an intimate approach for characters to learn more about each other but it often becomes a repetitive safety net. For whatever reason just about every peaceful moment has to be done while eating or cooking which grows stale. There’s other ways for characters to interact with each other but Infini-T Force has to constantly squeeze in these meal times at every possible opportunity rather than having the cast do other activities to develop their friendship. It even manages to ruin the impact of certain scenes as they’ll talk about something food related even when a battle reaches its climax.Possibly the best material from Infini-T Force is the main villain Z who offers a perspective of overprotective parenting. While Z’s main objective is to save the life of his daughter the sinful decisions he makes is what makes this show interesting. In the original stories from Tatsunoko in the 1970’s the heroes would have a recurring usage of bonding with their father usually by rescuing or avenging him. Having the villain Z being challenged as a father figure in these dangerous circumstances is a good tribute to past works of Tatsunoko Productions.On the other hand, the superheroics of this crossover are underwhelming when you’re well versed in any of the superheroes lore. The fight scenes are definitely cool & manages to be very well choreographed but there’s many missed opportunities for the characters to teach their roots to new viewers & pushes away their old school fan base. Casshan in the original series forfeited his humanity so he can’t feel or taste. While this show does try to make a sorrowful character its very anticlimactic for Casshan to have a human form projector. Sure he still doesn’t feel like a human being but the message would be stronger if Casshan didn’t have any human features. Aside from his brief conflict with Raja Kaan, Casshan doesn’t achieve much in this series especially not to viewers wanting to see a dark storyline similar to Casshern Sins or an emotional struggle like the 1973 Casshan anime. Casshan is simply too emotionless nor does he acknowledge his surroundings. In every version, Casshan comes from an apocalyptic wasteland so he should be surprised being sent to a peaceful world. Casshan never mentions his battle with Braiking Boss or his struggles in being an ostracized hero so it personally leaves me very unfulfilled. The original Hurricane Polymar wasn’t too heavy with plot nor did it go into complex viewpoints of right or wrong. Infini-T Force doesn’t interfere much with his character but it barely does anything new. At the start, Polymar seems to have a grudge with the villain Damian Gray but it’s quickly dropped. Tekkaman offers some resolution to the ending of his 1975 anime as it was cancelled with an inconclusive ending but the conflict with the villain Belle Lynn offers a small development to his character. It was a good dispute of opinions yet feels miniscule when compared to the overall theme created by Z & Emi. For better or worse, Ken the Eagle is the only superhero who gets a lot of focus but Gatchaman fans will be upset at certain things. For reasons unknown many characters nickname Ken as an old man or “Gramps” which is annoying. The same occurs to Tekkaman being branded as “Professor”. Ken along with the other heroes are around the same age of late teens and early twenties at least when referring to the original 1970 series. While it’s clear that Tekkaman & Ken have matured the most from their 70s counterparts, but they’re not old enough to be referred as older men especially when compared to Z. There’s also a recurring joke of Ken being unfamiliar with modern technology implying he comes from an older time period which is a bit odd as the other heroes also come from settings of the 70’s.Ultimately, Infini-T Force’s biggest flaw was attempting to accomplish too much in very little time. It doesn’t appeal to fans of the originals but does little to draw in a new crowd. The fight scenes are cool, the drama is good when it’s the main focus of the episode but the superheroes feel extremely shallow especially when they’re in Ken’s shadow. While I can see the importance of Ken The Eagle as a leader & has shown the most growth in the original Gatchman series of 205 episodes even as a fan I am upset that the other heroes don’t have much to do. The same can be said for the new villains exclusively for this anime as Z is ultimately the character with the most emphasis on Emi & the story.Can this show appeal to superhero fans? How does Infini-T Force fair against other superhero anime? Well it’s certainly better than 2017’s The Reflection but when paired up to the original anime storylines from the 1970’s,,, Infini-T Force doesn’t hold a candle. This was advertised as a “Superhero Crossover” yet the end result is more of guest appearances in the life of a sad girl. Rather than showing heroic things a lot of time feels a bit wasted with numerous dialogue scenes inside an apartment or eating. It’s not the spectacular superhero action that people would want. While the action scenes are impressive when they occur but they’re just too short to really appreciate the excitement. While the story isn’t awful it lacks focus & respect. The manga version of Inifini-T Force surprisingly puts a greater deal on the superhero roots of each character even informing the readers their past adventures & struggles. While the manga is still being published in the USA, I’d recommend that over this show, definitely to fan of the original anime they’re based on. But what about new viewers who don’t have any knowledge of these superheroes? Can they enjoy the show? Perhaps….if you’re willing to endure a messy structure of storytelling, however this anime will not resemble the anime these characters come from. So if it does succeed in getting a new person interested in the 1970’s anime I can’t easily picture those people being able to watch a different version of the characters they saw from Infini-T Force and feel happy. Maybe it can work if the source material gets them engaged but everyone’s different so I wouldn’t know for sure.In terms of superhero anime, Infini-T Force is a decent show but to viewers who wanted to see their favorite classic superheroes return…. it’s very disappointing. Infini-T Force is certainly tries to be ambitious but I would encourage watching the 70’s anime, reading the Infini-T Force manga or the following series:Gatchaman, Gatchaman 2, Gatchman F, Gatchaman OVA 1994Casshan 1973, Casshan Robot Hunter OVAHurricane Polymar 1973, Shin Hurricane Polymar OVATekkaman 1975Devilman Crybaby based on the Devilman 1972 MangaCyborg 009 VS Devilman, Cyborg 009 2001,HeromanKeyman Hand of JudgmentGuyver The Bio Boosted Armor 2005Garo The Animation, Garo Vanishing LineYatterman Night Force but not many for the established Tatsunoko fan.The show follows the story of a girl named Emi who’s suffering from suicidal thoughts & is neglected by her father.

(In the original Pegas was able to talk but is treated as an object in the Infini-T Force version.) In the 1975 story, Tekkaman was very young, angry & careless in his pursuit of ridding the Waldester but felt guilt when he accidently killed a family of innocent aliens. He was also racist towards Andro; a good alien who helped The Space Knights. As the story progressed, Tekkaman becomes friends with Andro putting their differences aside. His character in Infini-T Force is older and calmer than his 1975 version which shows an interesting display of maturity. While treated well within the show, regrettably Tekkaman has few scenes that allow him to show his growth as a man since Ken often takes the spotlight from other characters.Balance is difficult as Infini-T Force tries to juggle qualities aimed for two different age demographics; fans of the old shows & new viewers of modern times. While the anime initially draws the attention of the original fans by creating this superhero crossover it also displeases them with the “handsome” character redesigns when out of costume. It’s clearly an attempt to market the heroes as eye candy to the current generation of anime fans. While redesigns are welcomed to encourage more watchers, the characters don’t look & behave like their 1970’s sources. There’s several scenes depicting them as possible shipping partners for Emi to the point where it resembles a reverse harem especially when the 4 guys suddenly move in to her apartment.Many episodes alternate tone between a serious family drama, an epic superhero crossover and a slice of life female fantasy which all collide with each other. The worst aspects of it are the eating scenes as the series does a poor job in creating conversations. When things aren’t in a serious scene most of the time is spent on characters dining. This can work as an intimate approach for characters to learn more about each other but it often becomes a repetitive safety net. For whatever reason just about every peaceful moment has to be done while eating or cooking which grows stale. There’s other ways for characters to interact with each other but Infini-T Force has to constantly squeeze in these meal times at every possible opportunity rather than having the cast do other activities to develop their friendship. It even manages to ruin the impact of certain scenes as they’ll talk about something food related even when a battle reaches its climax.Possibly the best material from Infini-T Force is the main villain Z who offers a perspective of overprotective parenting. While Z’s main objective is to save the life of his daughter the sinful decisions he makes is what makes this show interesting. In the original stories from Tatsunoko in the 1970’s the heroes would have a recurring usage of bonding with their father usually by rescuing or avenging him. Having the villain Z being challenged as a father figure in these dangerous circumstances is a good tribute to past works of Tatsunoko Productions.On the other hand, the superheroics of this crossover are underwhelming when you’re well versed in any of the superheroes lore. The fight scenes are definitely cool & manages to be very well choreographed but there’s many missed opportunities for the characters to teach their roots to new viewers & pushes away their old school fan base. Casshan in the original series forfeited his humanity so he can’t feel or taste. While this show does try to make a sorrowful character its very anticlimactic for Casshan to have a human form projector. Sure he still doesn’t feel like a human being but the message would be stronger if Casshan didn’t have any human features. Aside from his brief conflict with Raja Kaan, Casshan doesn’t achieve much in this series especially not to viewers wanting to see a dark storyline similar to Casshern Sins or an emotional struggle like the 1973 Casshan anime. Casshan is simply too emotionless nor does he acknowledge his surroundings. In every version, Casshan comes from an apocalyptic wasteland so he should be surprised being sent to a peaceful world. Casshan never mentions his battle with Braiking Boss or his struggles in being an ostracized hero so it personally leaves me very unfulfilled. The original Hurricane Polymar wasn’t too heavy with plot nor did it go into complex viewpoints of right or wrong. Infini-T Force doesn’t interfere much with his character but it barely does anything new. At the start, Polymar seems to have a grudge with the villain Damian Gray but it’s quickly dropped. Tekkaman offers some resolution to the ending of his 1975 anime as it was cancelled with an inconclusive ending but the conflict with the villain Belle Lynn offers a small development to his character. It was a good dispute of opinions yet feels miniscule when compared to the overall theme created by Z & Emi. For better or worse, Ken the Eagle is the only superhero who gets a lot of focus but Gatchaman fans will be upset at certain things. For reasons unknown many characters nickname Ken as an old man or “Gramps” which is annoying. The same occurs to Tekkaman being branded as “Professor”. Ken along with the other heroes are around the same age of late teens and early twenties at least when referring to the original 1970 series. While it’s clear that Tekkaman & Ken have matured the most from their 70s counterparts, but they’re not old enough to be referred as older men especially when compared to Z. There’s also a recurring joke of Ken being unfamiliar with modern technology implying he comes from an older time period which is a bit odd as the other heroes also come from settings of the 70’s.Ultimately, Infini-T Force’s biggest flaw was attempting to accomplish too much in very little time. It doesn’t appeal to fans of the originals but does little to draw in a new crowd. The fight scenes are cool, the drama is good when it’s the main focus of the episode but the superheroes feel extremely shallow especially when they’re in Ken’s shadow. While I can see the importance of Ken The Eagle as a leader & has shown the most growth in the original Gatchman series of 205 episodes even as a fan I am upset that the other heroes don’t have much to do. The same can be said for the new villains exclusively for this anime as Z is ultimately the character with the most emphasis on Emi & the story.Can this show appeal to superhero fans? How does Infini-T Force fair against other superhero anime? Well it’s certainly better than 2017’s The Reflection but when paired up to the original anime storylines from the 1970’s,,, Infini-T Force doesn’t hold a candle. This was advertised as a “Superhero Crossover” yet the end result is more of guest appearances in the life of a sad girl. Rather than showing heroic things a lot of time feels a bit wasted with numerous dialogue scenes inside an apartment or eating. It’s not the spectacular superhero action that people would want. While the action scenes are impressive when they occur but they’re just too short to really appreciate the excitement. While the story isn’t awful it lacks focus & respect. The manga version of Inifini-T Force surprisingly puts a greater deal on the superhero roots of each character even informing the readers their past adventures & struggles. While the manga is still being published in the USA, I’d recommend that over this show, definitely to fan of the original anime they’re based on. But what about new viewers who don’t have any knowledge of these superheroes? Can they enjoy the show? Perhaps….if you’re willing to endure a messy structure of storytelling, however this anime will not resemble the anime these characters come from. So if it does succeed in getting a new person interested in the 1970’s anime I can’t easily picture those people being able to watch a different version of the characters they saw from Infini-T Force and feel happy. Maybe it can work if the source material gets them engaged but everyone’s different so I wouldn’t know for sure.In terms of superhero anime, Infini-T Force is a decent show but to viewers who wanted to see their favorite classic superheroes return…. it’s very disappointing. Infini-T Force is certainly tries to be ambitious but I would encourage watching the 70’s anime, reading the Infini-T Force manga or the following series:Gatchaman, Gatchaman 2, Gatchman F, Gatchaman OVA 1994Casshan 1973, Casshan Robot Hunter OVAHurricane Polymar 1973, Shin Hurricane Polymar OVATekkaman 1975Devilman Crybaby based on the Devilman 1972 MangaCyborg 009 VS Devilman, Cyborg 009 2001,HeromanKeyman Hand of JudgmentGuyver The Bio Boosted Armor 2005Garo The Animation, Garo Vanishing LineYatterman Night', ""I'm reviewing this from a mostly non-fan point of view (mostly cos I watched Gatchaman S1 but hardly remember it).Story: 9Kinda cliched in some areas, but overall quite interesting.

The good news is that now I won\'t have nightmares of someone repeating ""TAH-KEHHH-SHEEEE"" over and over in various ways.The ""heroes from different worlds/dimensions gathering in one place to fight a common enemy"" is all over the place, from just about every ""Tales"" series, to ""Kingdom Hearts"" to ""Final Fantasy"" to ""Cyborg 009 vs Devilman"" to a lot of comic crossovers. It leads to a lot of very similar villains and...plots. This one is largely no exception. What makes such a story stand out individually is the art, the character relationships, and how creative the creative team gets with mixing different character skills. Unfortunately this series managed to screw up pretty much all of those.One of the main problems is that the dialogue is so bad. I\'m not sure if it\'s a translation problem or what, or if it\'s the levels of nostalgic corniness being used on purpose a la this group of older franchise heroes, but ugh. Almost every line is like each character talking to a wall at the end of an episode of their respective series, which leads to a garbled mess of the audience asking ""what was I supposed to get out of that conversation? How did you get to that conclusion? Why are you friends? What are you asking this person to do? What are your goals?"" For example, a large portion of the series is the heroes getting annoyed at Emi\'s apathy, and their inability to get through to her. Yet their dialogue with her so nonsensical and basically comes down to ""Why are you like this? I feel like yelling more about something!"" It makes you actually dislike the heroes, who have no ability to communicate, and keep harassing this teenager who\'s letting them freeload at her house (except for Tetsuya, who doesn\'t say all that much).The dialogue makes so little sense that Emi\'s realization and the chipping away of her apathy feels completely random, like the script writers realized ""well, we need to move on with the plot now, so I guess she needs to stop being so apathetic."" Perhaps another issue is that the creative team behind this worked very hard to make a truly boring character who does nothing other than get angry at her friends, attempt suicidal driving on the road after school, then draw the same sunset every day, and go to sleep, that they added a whole TONE of apathy to the story. That is not fixable by Corny + Co. doing their Heroic Grins At The Camera or saying catch phrases or doing poses. And the irony is that Emi is ultimately the only really likeable character other than maybe Joji, who tries, and Tetsuya, who seems more like a kicked puppy for the whole series. Emi has a character arc that, at least if you\'ve seen these series before, you understand. The other heroes just... sort of exist. They fall into familiar tropes with antagonists who are largely uninteresting, and come to half-assed mini epiphanies with their particular villains that have little effect on their personalities/arcs before moving on with the plot.So much of the latter end of the series is characters yelling at each other without listening or changing that you can basically tune out the final battle without missing anything, which is pretty bad. ""I love you!"" ""But I want to change!"" ""But I love you!"" ""But I want to change!"" and so on, you\'ve seen it before, insert long, pointless battle in a void where the points don\'t matter because the damage isn\'t real and it\'s sort of a dream anyway.The 3D animation isn\'t awful. The almost-human faces are a bit cringey at times, but the animation is best used for mechanical things, like Casshan\'s armor, Friender, and the primary antagonist\'s outfit, although the Halloween costume scene was pretty good. The animation is worst in the flashback scenes that show up more and more in the latter half of the series. Combined with the even worse and at times pretty darn creepy dialogue, it\'s just altogether shudder-worthy. The fight sequences are largely forgettable, except for that first Casshan fight, where Casshan owns everyone. Which is hilarious because I\'m pretty sure that\'s why he\'s largely left out of the rest of the series? Because he\'s stronger than everyone apparently?I know I keep harping on Casshan and Emi, but honestly one of the few highlights of the series was when they interact. There\'s an early scene where the protagonist gang are in a crumbling subway and while the three \'adult\' heroes are discussing things, Emi, Friender, and Casshan are exploring the area in a sort of childlike manner. It\'s pretty sweet, and honestly a lot less creepy than every scene where Emi is a literal child in flashbacks. Friender as \'Group Dog\' is adorable. Joji as \'Group Parent\' is sweet, although the way they keep harping on him being \'nerdy\' or whatever just breaks the suspension of disbelief for a while. Like... you all use mechanical armor and weapons? Is there something wrong with like... knowing basic information now? This wouldn\'t be so bad if there wasn\'t literally a scene where Takeshi compliments Joji for knowing a vagueish definition of Halloween. Like... the pseudo-detective thinks the \'nerdy\' dude should be congratulated for maybe reading wikipedia or Google badly? Huh? It\'s awkwardness and bad dialogue like this that fills the series, making it hard to relate to these people.As a last note on delivery, I\'ll bring Casshan back again: his inability to taste things is brought up a couple times throughout the series, but it\'s poorly handled after the first time, and the way the heroes react to it doesn\'t make sense. Joji thinks it can be solved mechanically. Takeshi says ""NO MECHANICS AREN\'T AN ISSUE FOR THE CYBORG"" and Ken probably also thinks that FEELINGS WILL WIN THE DAY. What ultimately happens? Well... we don\'t know. Literally. They don\'t tell us. This mini thing just resolves itself for no apparent reason. Anyone who has watched these kind of series can think of several reasons why, on their own, but without editorializing, it\'s a weird sort of joke/character developmentish thing that\'s dealt with badly.Why do these characters fight together? Honestly it\'s because they need to. There\'s that generic camaraderie that arises from people thrown into a bad situation together, but by the time we\'re supposed to believe this is one unit, we\'ve seen no evidence of bonding experience outside episode 1. Tetsuya wakes up surrounded by these people but doesn\'t even question it. You know. As you do. Ken, the vaguely chauvinistic old-fashioned weirdo whose odd technophobia is badly played for laughs, despite his introduction involving him in a high-tech jet attacking a mechanical base... from the beginning you can see that he\'s going to be the one Emi goes through an emotional bonding experience with, because of course the two who hate each other the most will bond by the end. The predictability isn\'t bad, but Ken is so unlikable as a character, if for no other reason that there\'s nothing funny or interesting about him, and he\'s basically the weakest of the group until late in the series, that you don\'t really care about his relationship with Emi until the end of the series. He doesn\'t grow. They just... are friends now?So the story is meh. Saying ""you\'ve seen it before"" doesn\'t do the series justice, but you have, and this one doesn\'t stand out at all. The art is all right, but frequently uncomfortable to watch. The characters at best are pretty boring with payoffs that largely aren\'t worth the wait. The cutesy \'humor\' is bad. I would honestly rate this lower if it didn\'t have Emi\'s ultimate character development or it hadn\'t animated Casshan and Friender so well.If you like this, or you want this kind of story, watch ""Cyborg 009 vs Devilman"". That\'s got some old franchise heroes with modern animation that is far better than this. The story is meh but at least it looks nice, and ""Cyborg 009"" fans would be happy. Watch ""Casshern Sins"" if you want a well-animated, good, albeit depressing, Casshan story. watch ""Tiger & Bunny"" if you want superheroes but with some cheese, but done well, with heart and good plot and animation. Watch ""Darker Than Black"" or ""Durarara!!"" if you want modern day Japan with some superhero shenanigans and humor and a lot of character bonding and interaction. Watch ""12 Kingdoms"" if you want to see a female high schooler thrown into an impossible situation she definitely doesn\'t want to be in combined with some amazing character development, good animation, and really great story.

Like many, I grew up in the Gatchaman era and in North America, we knew that show as Battle of the Planets.  It was without a doubt, one of my favorite animes.  For the other 3 animes, I have learned about them in video games.  If you are nostalgic, Infini-T Force's goal was to bring all 4 animes together with some of the elements that marked each one.  I can say that the show focused a lot more on Ken from Gatchaman then the other 3,...but what do you expect, Gatchaman is the better anime.  I just love the jokes they do at the beginning when Ken sees a smartphone, preferred the one with buttons and does not know how to use it because he is from the 60's/70's?  Hahaha  Ken is a silly/corky guy in the show, but they show us his more wise/serious side... which is really who he is deep inside... ...Curry! ;DThe BGM and OP/ED songs are awesome and fits with the scenes in question.  You will cry at various points in the anime...  They do scenes that touches your heart...We only have 1 episode left to close off this series.  But fear not as the full length movie with the same crew (and more...) is coming early in 2018.  I cannot wait to see it! but what do you expect, Gatchaman is the better anime.

But fear not as the full length movie with the same crew (and more...) is coming early in 2018.  I cannot wait to see it!"", 'Ok, first review, and some background first as I am approaching this from a purists point of view.So, I come to this being a watcher of an older persuasion with a history that spans over 4 decades, and is this wonderous new age where anime is much more easily on tap and things really need to stand up. I\'m first gen Battle of the Planets (which should ballpark my age for you), first gen Akira, first gen ""That Overfiend movie"" - I also did many of the now considered classics first time around... except FMA: Brotherhood which I\'ve caught up on over lockdown (Fantastic......if you haven\'t go and watch that instead) and now catching up on One Piece (that theme tune alone is worth a visit).To the more relevant history for this: I own all the Gatchaman DVD sets from the early 2000s (and the lesson here kids is don\'t buy things on a media cause in about 8 years a new media will come along and your media will be all redundant and the replacement will cost a 1/3rd as much and then crunchyroll will appear and you can watch it all there anywhere) and have additionally sat through the entirety S2 and S3 of the deteriorating Gatchaman series. The promise is there, but boy does it get bad.I\'ve also seen all of Casshern, including the recent Sins - which was pretty good.On the other hands I\'ve also seen that Gatchaman Crowds... which... oh dear... why would you do that to Gatchaman and Berg - the brilliant antagonist from S1. Bilge.And that leads us into the first point here: Ken, G1, Gatchaman - Sometimes one, sometimes five; the white shadow that moves unseen... but here only one cause if all five were here then we wouldn\'t need the rest of them. But first off, a VERY different personality... a whiny teenage personality instead of the headstrong/ptsd\'d leader of the SNTG almost like the writers hadn\'t watched the original. So not off to a good start.But damn does he look great - highlighting the original designwork was a classic!Unfortunately it\'s done in that Final Fantasy rubbish CGI - so... well you can\'t have everything.Hey, at least it isn\'t Berserk 2017 CGI!So what is the point of this anime: ""To celebrate 50 years of Tomei, and raise awareness of many of the characters that defined the archetypes an entire industry is built upon."". Hopefully this just existing has helped point at these characters - because it\'s following the current trend by awful writers in a trend we shall call ""Disney Star Warsing"" of ignoring the canon, not actually being aware of the source in the first place, and completely just inserting the writers half arsed not very good story with the characters in a very sub-fan-fic way - cause at least Fan-Fic likes the source...This, like Gatchaman Crowds (have I offered how bilge that is?) suffers a bit from ""Disney Star Warsing"", ok it\'s not a bad case of this, but it\'s definitely got elements of that - however I think this is more around the issues addressed below in the bad.So, the good...Story: It\'s a serviceable story - the antagonists all have genuine human reasons (although they\'re a little on the stupid side). The main antagonist does have a really good reason and in flash backs it shows how this spirals out of control. It could be better, but it definitely could be worse. It is however a bit muddied, and needs a good edit.Fight Scenes: These are great! Well choreographed - exciting... although sometimes they just end and you\'re thinking ""Is that it?"" and the anime is definitely going ""Yeah, that\'s it baby! 30seconds with me is ALL you need!"".Character Interactions: The Heroes and Villians interactions are often really good - especially the jostling for position amongst the heroes. All used to either being in charge or being solo they bounce off each other until they settle into a good groove. This is actually pretty well written.The Human Element: The Heroes don\'t just kick the crap out of the bad guys, they actually try a bit of compassion. Rare and appreciated. This raises the score from a 4 to a 6.And the bad...Emi: Wow... how annoying can you make a lead character? Whiney whiney whiney. She\'s definitely not going to pass the Bechdel test.Bearing in mind this is Tomei who gave us Jun in 1972 - who even in the face of the stereotypes of the time ran her own business, adopted an orphan boy, and kicked Galactors Butt with the best of them. I think she\'s meant to be apathetic and depressed, but comes across as entitled and petchulent.Fan Service: I do not need to see crotch, boobs, or rear end every two minutes... every ten minutes is more than fine. bdum tsh.Too Many Characters Not Enough Time: You don\'t really get to appreciate any of the characters. And to make them stand out, as most of them are just copies of G1 they\'ve had to edit each of the personalities to fit. As already highlighted G1 comes off badly. You hardly see anything of Casshern. if you haven\'t go and watch that instead) and now catching up on One Piece (that theme tune alone is worth a visit).To the more relevant history for this: I own all the Gatchaman DVD sets from the early 2000s (and the lesson here kids is don\'t buy things on a media cause in about 8 years a new media will come along and your media will be all redundant and the replacement will cost a 1/3rd as much and then crunchyroll will appear and you can watch it all there anywhere) and have additionally sat through the entirety S2 and S3 of the deteriorating Gatchaman series. The promise is there, but boy does it get bad.I\'ve also seen all of Casshern, including the recent Sins - which was pretty good.On the other hands I\'ve also seen that Gatchaman Crowds... which... oh dear... why would you do that to Gatchaman and Berg - the brilliant antagonist from S1. Bilge.And that leads us into the first point here: Ken, G1, Gatchaman - Sometimes one, sometimes five; the white shadow that moves unseen... but here only one cause if all five were here then we wouldn\'t need the rest of them. But first off, a VERY different personality... a whiny teenage personality instead of the headstrong/ptsd\'d leader of the SNTG almost like the writers hadn\'t watched the original. So not off to a good start.But damn does he look great - highlighting the original designwork was a classic!Unfortunately it\'s done in that Final Fantasy rubbish CGI - so... well you can\'t have everything.Hey, at least it isn\'t Berserk 2017 CGI!So what is the point of this anime: ""To celebrate 50 years of Tomei, and raise awareness of many of the characters that defined the archetypes an entire industry is built upon."". Hopefully this just existing has helped point at these characters - because it\'s following the current trend by awful writers in a trend we shall call ""Disney Star Warsing"" of ignoring the canon, not actually being aware of the source in the first place, and completely just inserting the writers half arsed not very good story with the characters in a very sub-fan-fic way - cause at least Fan-Fic likes the source...This, like Gatchaman Crowds (have I offered how bilge that is?) suffers a bit from ""Disney Star Warsing"", ok it\'s not a bad case of this, but it\'s definitely got elements of that - however I think this is more around the issues addressed below in the bad.So, the good...Story: It\'s a serviceable story - the antagonists all have genuine human reasons (although they\'re a little on the stupid side). The main antagonist does have a really good reason and in flash backs it shows how this spirals out of control. It could be better, but it definitely could be worse. It is however a bit muddied, and needs a good edit.Fight Scenes: These are great! Well choreographed - exciting... although sometimes they just end and you\'re thinking ""Is that it?"" and the anime is definitely going ""Yeah, that\'s it baby! 30seconds with me is ALL you need!"".Character Interactions: The Heroes and Villians interactions are often really good - especially the jostling for position amongst the heroes. All used to either being in charge or being solo they bounce off each other until they settle into a good groove. This is actually pretty well written.The Human Element: The Heroes don\'t just kick the crap out of the bad guys, they actually try a bit of compassion. Rare and appreciated. This raises the score from a 4 to a 6.And the bad...Emi: Wow... how annoying can you make a lead character? Whiney whiney whiney. She\'s definitely not going to pass the Bechdel test.Bearing in mind this is Tomei who gave us Jun in 1972 - who even in the face of the stereotypes of the time ran her own business, adopted an orphan boy, and kicked Galactors Butt with the best of them. I think she\'s meant to be apathetic and depressed, but comes across as entitled and petchulent.Fan Service: I do not need to see crotch, boobs, or rear end every two minutes... every ten minutes is more than fine. bdum tsh.Too Many Characters Not Enough Time: You don\'t really get to appreciate any of the characters.

Corpse Party: Tortured Souls - Bougyakusareta Tamashii no Jukyou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15037/Corpse_Party__Tortured_Souls_-_Bougyakusareta_Tamashii_no_Jukyou,"[""Hello. Well this was probably the most disturbing thing I have ever seen in my life. Not only is this the most disturbing animated series I have ever watched, it is the most disturbing fiction work I have had the pleasure of experiencing.This is one of those series that makes you cringe but you still love it because it takes you on a well written story. Where as this is still not my favorite horror anime, I still think that it did an amazing job with what little time it had. It had a story and a conclusion and we were not left with a...cliffhanger like Umineko left us with. But what I really want to emphasis on is the fact that series fit everything into 4, half-hour long episodes. This is amazing for that small length of time.I also want to bring in the concept of how good the disturbing art was. The art in this series did such a good job at making the art disturbing and grotesque that I almost vomited a couple times throughout the series. I did notice some similarities between this and the Team Silent Silent Hill game's art, what with blood coming down the walls and bodies everywhere, and that was generally a good choice, just to make the series that little bit more disturbing.The opening theme was pretty good and most of the background sound, or even the lack of sound at points was a good choice for the series. You can really see the inspiration from Akira Yamaoka within the soundtrack and I thought that it was genuinely a good choice to go that way for a horror series.The place where this series is a bit lacking is the unoriginal cast of characters. Though, to be fair, it is harder to create a cast of characters within this genre of horror that is original while also keeping it in a more modern time line, you could of done better than taking the generic cast of highschool students (2 possible lesbians, 1 guy with glasses, 1 hopelessly brave guy, the little sister, the occult freak, and the guy with no defining features what so ever, otherwise know as the boring guy). But the character of Sachiko was pretty original. Half of the things that happened with this character I didn't see coming and I just love her voice actress.But for my overall enjoyment. I really enjoyed this series. it was a very genuinely well made horror series that kind of goes away from the norm. I do genuinely believe that there aren't many series that pulled off this sort of thing nearly as well, and definitely not in the same time frame as Corpse Party. cliffhanger like Umineko left us with.

There you are, trapped. Can't even shout, can't even cry, the dangers are coming by. When you realize that death is coming before you, screams are shouted out but you won't be heard. But that's just the beginning. For once you're trapped, Corpse Party will take you to a place where your life will never ever be the same again. (that is if and only if you escape alive)Corpse Party: Tortured Souls - Bougyakusareta Tamashii no Jukyou (or simply known as Corpse Party: Tortured Souls) is a series of four OVA episodes. The animation is...based off the game and chronicles the events in which a group of young students tells ghost stories at a school known Kisaragi Academy. However, they soon become haunted by the ghosts themselves after the earth shaken and sucks them deep down into the abyss....of the once existent school known as Heavenly Host Elementary School.As this is a horror theme series, expect dark themes such as blood, gore, and death. I'll just throw a warning sign right now that if you can't take the first episode (or rather the first 20 minutes), then you might not have enough stomach to make it. I'll just say this as bluntly as I can:This series is about watching kids getting murdered. Got it? Good.There is a sense of hopelessness in Corpse Party. Because the characters are trapped in this new environment of darkness, they struggle to survive both physically and mentally. The taunting scenes of blood and body parts carves a haunting memory into the characters. In particular, the first episode sets up a graphic premise for a particular girl named Naomi after she witnesses a gruesome death of her friend. It is from there on that we immediately take notice just the grievous situation our characters are in. The deaths and tortures are real and there's no turning back. Rather than a ghost story, this might be the final chapter for our characters' lives. Corpse Party paints such dark themes as the way it conveys itself from the premise.Happiness though? Honestly, there's none of that anymore. The joy and smiles from the faces of our main characters are wiped forever so don't expect any happy scenes in this episodes. What's more taunting deals with the fact that a few bonding scenes between certain characters are lived out so damn short. It really creates a sense of hopelessness and despair, more fueled so by the way the characters die off so tragically. As the group of students are separated into closed spaces of the alternate dimension, there's little hope of working together to escape. They are literally trapped rats. The souls are the predator and the kids are the prey.Corpse Party also has a sense of mystery in its atmosphere. The mystery part comes from the  Heavenly Host Elementary School where years ago, several staff members and students mysteriously vanished following murders and strange instances. It just happens that deja vu happens again and the murders are reanimated. The mystery aspect can be comparable to Another, Higurashi, and other series involving mysterious murders. The murders themselves are also quite graphic so be wary of gore and violence.Character wise, the series is only condensed into two hours with these four episodes combined. Hence, don't expect everything to be adapted from the game. Because of that time length issue, most characters only gets some moments; some with drastic exits. The characters themselves tries to figure out not only how to escape but also of the history on what happened previously in the past. This specifically involves the origins of the Heavenly Host Elementary School and the murdered students. It is essential to unlock its mysteries (I guess similar to the game as well) because it will also allow the students to escape. More importantly though, it will also allow them to understand exactly why they were trapped in the first place.Unfortunately, this series tries a way too hard especially in the violence department. It wastes no time with the blood and violent moments involving various weapons of torture. The taunting screams echoing throughout the school is also too old fashioned. Story wise, it's also quite confusing. Perhaps the length might be the issue here. In short, too many questions with not many clues to go on at first. More frustrating enough is the confusion on who is friend or foe. Plus, let's not also forget the fact that the violence itself serves more as a way to cover up the more exciting mystery aspect of the series. It literally kills any way for viewers to enjoy this series in formulating theories. Most of the time, you'll be watching kids running for their lives against fate even though everything seems to be hopeless. Oh and the supernatural part....kids murdering kids inside a school, ah the irony.In terms of artwork, I do admit that the series conveys the atmosphere quite well with the gruesome violence. Characters are simple but to the point with nothing too flashy. The murdered kids from years ago all give off a creepy atmosphere by their disfigured faces. Then, there's the school itself or rather more specifically the Heavenly Host Elementary School. The structure of the school is designed to look old, haunted, and creepy. It hardly looks any realistic but definitely fits within the Corpse Party theme.As soundtrack goes, expect some high standards. What I mean is the quality of the OST as it is strong enough to create a sense of fear for both the characters and maybe even for you, the viewers. The way it is orchestrated is thrilling with tearing vibrations. I have not played the game before but from my understanding, there's some of that original feeling from the game we get into this series. The OP and ED song are also strengths of this series that marks both the beginning and end of each episode. The voice acting is decent to convey the way the characters react to situations with their loud screaming. Their new-found situation has the characters scream at the top of their lungs and the voice actors/actresses does a well job at that. In particular, I find Kitamura Eri and Nakamura Yuuichi's performance to be quite well done.So ultimately, I think a score of '6' is justifiable for Corpse Party. Oh I'd love to flip that number upside down but the lack of a decent story and destruction of a calm ending makes this a bit frustrating to watch all the way through. Oh and the violence serves as just pure shock value than anything taken for granted. It's also hard to understand certain situations at many stances because you might be more taken in more by the OST and violence than anything else. It's a ghost story gone wrong but I do have to admit that the premise is set up well. The concept's execution is quite gruesome so this might be something you'd watch on some weekend night with your friend while hunting down a scary movie to watch. Rather watching a horror movie like The Grudge, Corpse Party could be the alternative. For me though, this series was crafted out of violence, screaming, torture, and souls.

It was simply...mind numbingly stupid. And incomprehensibly bloody. Corpse party is an opera of gore which not only fails as an anime, but also fails on every fundamental level of the horror genre.Plot: 2/10The story begins with a group of people in a classroom performing a ritual of some sort. They suddenly and inexplicably get transported into another dimension full of other students who are getting killed by these mysterious ghosts as well as each other. While this may seem interesting enough (to those with twisted minds...who enjoy watching miserable characters suffer immense pain and anguish), one must keep in mind that the producers tried to fit a ton of material into just four episodes. This resulted in Corpse Party being incredibly rushed and full of plot holes. Many things were left unexplained and the anime just felt unfulfilling. Nothing much happened in this show besides tons of mindless killing. The only thing that somewhat redeemed the plot revolved around a little ghost girl and why she dragged these kids into her twisted dimension, though even that was too insignificant to salvage this train wreck.Characters: 1/10This might be where the anime failed the hardest. Throughout the entire show all of the characters just mindlessly killed each other or suddenly became absolutely hysterical. Most didn\'t even bother trying to escape the alternate reality that they were trapped in and were just like ""lol, I\'m gonna die here anyway, so might as well brutally massacre the other student trapped here with me!"" The cast were generally aggravating to watch and the majority of their decisions were nonsensical. The most interesting character was the ghost girl, because the writers at least seemed to try to give her some development, but it still wasn\'t enough to make me care in the slightest. I also couldn\'t tell you the name of a single character from this show. They\'re just that forgettable.Art: 4/10The visuals are pretty average. I thought that the characters looked quite bland and it was always too dark to actually make out the features of the scenery and characters anyway. Then there\'s the gore, which always came in unrealistic amounts at a time, making moments that were supposed to be horrifying seem almost comical.Sound: 7/10I will say that I thought the opening theme was a nice sounding composition. Plus I have no complaints about the soundtrack, which worked efficiently in some situations and gave the show more of an edge. Also the screams sounded painful/hysterical enough to be believable and the maniacal laughs were good. At least the voice actors tried to get the audience to care. The producers should have followed their example.Enjoyment: 2/10I was cringing while watching this. Once again I must say that it wasn\'t because it was ""scary""; it was just bad. I really couldn\'t invest myself in this anime due to it\'s atrocious story telling techniques. The one good thing about the anime being only four episodes was that I was able to finish it rather quickly.Overall: 2/10In conclusion, Corpse Party was just horrendous. I watched it hoping for a horror anime on par with the likes of Higurashi. Instead I got a rushed and poorly designed show that I\'m simply better off forgetting. I\'d suggest Corpse Party to those interested in media focused on horror and gore (though don\'t expect much).

It\'s easy enough to expect the opposite; after all, for some reason a lot of would-be horrifying, gory anime are hit with the unfortunate black bars of censorship, or the convenient off-screen carnage of PG-13 justice, or otherwise just have a mechanism to protect your eyes from seeing violence, even if violence is the reason you\'re there. Sometimes the Blu-ray edition arrives months later to fix that, and sometimes it just remained unfixed, forever covered in a shining white light across the...screen where entrails should\'ve been visible. In the case of ""Corpse Party: Tortured Souls"", the title alone brazenly declares that it has torture, corpses, spirits of the dead, and raves. It\'s practically OBLIGATED to be a gruesome splatterfest, PG-13 be damned.At first glance, though, it might seem like the odds are against that. There are primarily three sorts of people who would watch this anime: unassuming strangers who want to see high school students get abused by ghosts, unassuming strangers who are squeamish to blood and don\'t yet know that this anime will feature high school students getting abused by ghosts, and fans of the video game it adapts who want to see their favorite high school students get abused by ghosts, this time animated. However, said source material, Corpse Party (...Blood Covered: Repeated Fear) is a handheld video game that\'s developed by a rather small studio. So visually, what it can show is inherently limited to pixelated guts and the occasional artist CG. To amend this, the game mainly relies on its excellent audio and writing to convey its horrors. In many ways, reading a lengthy description of a torture scene, alongside the horrifyingly realistic screams of the talented voice cast, is a lot more  effective than flatly \'showing\' what takes place. To add to that, ""Tortured Souls"" is actually the second OVA based on the franchise, the first one, ""Missing Footage"", being more of a trailer. Despite being an OVA and therefore being more immune to censorship than television broadcast series, Missing Footage ended up being censored all the same.So, taking into account the style of horror displayed in the source material, which is unsuitable to be imitated properly in an animated adaptation, and Missing Footage being an unfortunate display of censorship, there should be no reason to assume Tortured Souls will fully live up to its title. There shouldn\'t be, and yet, well......Corpse Party: Tortured Souls ended up being, quite simply, a slasher film in animated format.Does it live up to its title? It damn well surpasses the title, as it\'s not called ""Corpse Party: Tortured Souls: Eyeballs Being Skewered by Goddamn Scissors: Now With 50% Less Innards"". Basically, they did not hold back. The very concept of ""holding back"" was brutalized as much as the show\'s main cast. The result is nothing short of a 2 hour guro display of high school students being violently executed, fitting squarely into the genre of ""Slicing of Lives"". No censorship whatsoever; no hopes or dreams, either.Without a doubt, the brutality and even the plot-induced psychological despair deserve some respect for how unadulterated they are. Of course, like quite a few other Japanese horrors, it relies on vaguely sexual gore and excessive violence more so than the ""don\'t look behind your back!"" sort of subtle scares (or God forbid jump scares), accomplishing a result that\'s more \'disturbing\' than \'scary\', but it executes the former absolutely splendidly while still retaining aspects of the latter. And yet unfortunately, there\'s still something besides that to be desired, something that\'s perhaps only noticeable while having the source material as a point of comparison. The more \'refined\' elements, the ones that aren\'t judged by the amount of spleens visible to the naked eye; that is, the characters themselves, and to a lesser extent the plot in general.Alongside its more subtle direction of horror, the main protagonists in the video game were more than just slaughter material for the villains. In classic utsuge fashion, all the characters that end up dying horribly are to varying degrees likable, given background, motivations, something to make you care for them. Unsurprisingly, though, Tortured Souls ended up suffering from the bane of many, many video-game-to-anime adaptations: time constraints. Jamming lengthy stories into 12 episodes- or in this case, only 4. The characters have been reduced to the absolute basics of what their personalities should consist of. However, unlike most cases, there was a way to make the best out of this predicament, and that was intentionally shifting the focus from the characters to the beheading thereof. It took a more ""western"" approach to horror, one that doesn\'t try to make the viewer particularly empathic or attached to the characters, essentially amplifying the raw horror and gore aspects at the cost of the emotional and heartbreaking ones. To this end, the characters were more than just ""reduced to their basics"", and some of them were altered to act in a stranger way as part of the process of shocking the audience- for instance, altering one of the characters\' deaths from a suicide to an armed fit of madness, in the process getting quickly killed by another character.On the storyline front, the premise is as simple as always. A bunch of teenagers and a teacher accidentally perform a ritual that transports them to the cursed Heavenly Ho- I mean, Tenjin Elementary School, in which dying means experience the pain of your death for all eternity as a soul (a \'tortured soul\', if you will). While the plot unsurprisingly progresses a lot quicker than usual and several minor and major plot points are different, none of this is exactly  noticeable without being familiar with the source material- which begs the question, does it really matter? All things considered, the result in question is by no means bad. Shallow, arguably, and perhaps even disappointing in some aspects. But \'bad\' would be far too much of a stretch. Looking at the production values, most everything is pretty good- sure enough, the animation for most \'normal\' scenes isn\'t the best Studio Asread has produced, especially considering that this is an OVA and not a television broadcast, but the, uh, \'raunchier\' scenes are done well and are pleasing to the eyes. In as much as decapitation is capable of being ""pleasing to the eyes"".And as the ""Party"" in the title promises, the soundtrack is great, albeit primarily recycled from the game. The voice cast is terrific, featuring good ol\' Pikachu as the main antagonist, and A Certain strangely familiar scientific pairing among the main protagonists. The opening song performed by resident cast member Asami Imai is likewise superb, and the cast\'s performances are enough to make all the gory scenes disturbing even with the screen turned off. All in all, the audio is very splendidly done.And so, the main drawback lies with the characters. Even while being a stranger to the franchise, it\'s easy enough to see that neither the protagonists nor the antagonists are particularly deeply thought out, to the point where it\'s hard to see them as being a lot more than a hunter and its prey, both serving as the \'trigger\' for the violence to occur. But had I been a stranger to the franchise, I would\'ve by no means expected anything really beyond that from something titled ""Corpse Party"". Considering this and the dramatically different ending, the best way to enjoy Tortured Souls would be to treat it as a standalone creation. This way, Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is a very welcome addition to horror anime, and makes for a great anti-censorship statement, and an example to be followed.On the other hand, if you find the notion of panty shots flashing directly before the violent mutilation of a schoolgirl to be disagreeable, consider not watching Corpse Party: Tortured Souls, as Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is very, very disagreeable. screen where entrails should\'ve been visible. In the case of ""Corpse Party: Tortured Souls"", the title alone brazenly declares that it has torture, corpses, spirits of the dead, and raves. It\'s practically OBLIGATED to be a gruesome splatterfest, PG-13 be damned.At first glance, though, it might seem like the odds are against that. There are primarily three sorts of people who would watch this anime: unassuming strangers who want to see high school students get abused by ghosts, unassuming strangers who are squeamish to blood and don\'t yet know that this anime will feature high school students getting abused by ghosts, and fans of the video game it adapts who want to see their favorite high school students get abused by ghosts, this time animated. However, said source material, Corpse Party (...Blood Covered: Repeated Fear) is a handheld video game that\'s developed by a rather small studio. So visually, what it can show is inherently limited to pixelated guts and the occasional artist CG. To amend this, the game mainly relies on its excellent audio and writing to convey its horrors. In many ways, reading a lengthy description of a torture scene, alongside the horrifyingly realistic screams of the talented voice cast, is a lot more  effective than flatly \'showing\' what takes place. To add to that, ""Tortured Souls"" is actually the second OVA based on the franchise, the first one, ""Missing Footage"", being more of a trailer. Despite being an OVA and therefore being more immune to censorship than television broadcast series, Missing Footage ended up being censored all the same.So, taking into account the style of horror displayed in the source material, which is unsuitable to be imitated properly in an animated adaptation, and Missing Footage being an unfortunate display of censorship, there should be no reason to assume Tortured Souls will fully live up to its title. There shouldn\'t be, and yet, well......Corpse Party: Tortured Souls ended up being, quite simply, a slasher film in animated format.Does it live up to its title? It damn well surpasses the title, as it\'s not called ""Corpse Party: Tortured Souls: Eyeballs Being Skewered by Goddamn Scissors: Now With 50% Less Innards"". Basically, they did not hold back. The very concept of ""holding back"" was brutalized as much as the show\'s main cast. The result is nothing short of a 2 hour guro display of high school students being violently executed, fitting squarely into the genre of ""Slicing of Lives"". No censorship whatsoever; no hopes or dreams, either.Without a doubt, the brutality and even the plot-induced psychological despair deserve some respect for how unadulterated they are. Of course, like quite a few other Japanese horrors, it relies on vaguely sexual gore and excessive violence more so than the ""don\'t look behind your back!"" sort of subtle scares (or God forbid jump scares), accomplishing a result that\'s more \'disturbing\' than \'scary\', but it executes the former absolutely splendidly while still retaining aspects of the latter. And yet unfortunately, there\'s still something besides that to be desired, something that\'s perhaps only noticeable while having the source material as a point of comparison. The more \'refined\' elements, the ones that aren\'t judged by the amount of spleens visible to the naked eye; that is, the characters themselves, and to a lesser extent the plot in general.Alongside its more subtle direction of horror, the main protagonists in the video game were more than just slaughter material for the villains. In classic utsuge fashion, all the characters that end up dying horribly are to varying degrees likable, given background, motivations, something to make you care for them. Unsurprisingly, though, Tortured Souls ended up suffering from the bane of many, many video-game-to-anime adaptations: time constraints. Jamming lengthy stories into 12 episodes- or in this case, only 4. The characters have been reduced to the absolute basics of what their personalities should consist of. However, unlike most cases, there was a way to make the best out of this predicament, and that was intentionally shifting the focus from the characters to the beheading thereof. It took a more ""western"" approach to horror, one that doesn\'t try to make the viewer particularly empathic or attached to the characters, essentially amplifying the raw horror and gore aspects at the cost of the emotional and heartbreaking ones. To this end, the characters were more than just ""reduced to their basics"", and some of them were altered to act in a stranger way as part of the process of shocking the audience- for instance, altering one of the characters\' deaths from a suicide to an armed fit of madness, in the process getting quickly killed by another character.On the storyline front, the premise is as simple as always. A bunch of teenagers and a teacher accidentally perform a ritual that transports them to the cursed Heavenly Ho- I mean, Tenjin Elementary School, in which dying means experience the pain of your death for all eternity as a soul (a \'tortured soul\', if you will). While the plot unsurprisingly progresses a lot quicker than usual and several minor and major plot points are different, none of this is exactly  noticeable without being familiar with the source material- which begs the question, does it really matter? All things considered, the result in question is by no means bad. Shallow, arguably, and perhaps even disappointing in some aspects. But \'bad\' would be far too much of a stretch. Looking at the production values, most everything is pretty good- sure enough, the animation for most \'normal\' scenes isn\'t the best Studio Asread has produced, especially considering that this is an OVA and not a television broadcast, but the, uh, \'raunchier\' scenes are done well and are pleasing to the eyes. In as much as decapitation is capable of being ""pleasing to the eyes"".And as the ""Party"" in the title promises, the soundtrack is great, albeit primarily recycled from the game. The voice cast is terrific, featuring good ol\' Pikachu as the main antagonist, and A Certain strangely familiar scientific pairing among the main protagonists. The opening song performed by resident cast member Asami Imai is likewise superb, and the cast\'s performances are enough to make all the gory scenes disturbing even with the screen turned off. All in all, the audio is very splendidly done.And so, the main drawback lies with the characters. Even while being a stranger to the franchise, it\'s easy enough to see that neither the protagonists nor the antagonists are particularly deeply thought out, to the point where it\'s hard to see them as being a lot more than a hunter and its prey, both serving as the \'trigger\' for the violence to occur.

And i apologize in advance for the mistakes ill make.Corpse Party: Tortured souls  blew my mind, It was absolutely disturbing to the point that it just made me sick to my stomach and this is coming from someone who enjoys watching horror/gore animes but even though it was disturbing i really did enjoy it.Although the plot was your typical ''Students trapped into an creepy building'' kind of plot i still enjoyed it and after it ended it left me craving for more.The blood coming out of the walls, Organs splashing everywhere.. God...it was so amazing. The graphics were just so outstanding also the main reason why i kept watching. Yes it was disturbing and yes i had moments where i wanted to put down my laptop and run to the toilet to vomit.. But i just couldn't stop watching and when i can't stop watching something you know you've created an masterpieceUsually when i watch an anime i always skip the opening theme but i kept the opening theme of this anime playing which automatically means i like it so that was done pretty well.I'm kind of disapointed that the characters weren't original because in every ''Students trapped into an creepy building'' story you have the type of characters this anime had and i wish could see the characters develop but then again what do you expect in an 4, half- hour long episodes.I liked the way it ended i'm glad it didn't end in an cliffhanger though of course i wish they made more episodes but it's understandable considering these ova's were created to attract more people to play the corpse party videogameI give this series overall an 8 i would have given it an 10 if it wasn't for the way the characters were portrayed and if it wasn't for such an overused plot.Overall i really enjoyed this series and i recommend it if you like gore/horror and have an strong stomach! it was so amazing.

And, to be honest, probably the only reason I enjoyed at all is because I had already played the game. Otherwise, it would have...been a lot of general confusion on my part.

(""It\'s so disturbing!"")I wasn\'t exactly disappointed... I just have high standards. I\'m extremely critical of the horror genre because I am not easily scared and they usually lack a good story, which is most important to me.Story:It was better than I thought it would be. I honestly expected a half-assed ending with no real conclusion and tons of plot holes. But it was actually pretty good. The explanations for the events in the story were interesting and made decent sense. But that only came...into play in the last episode. The first 3 episodes just weren\'t that original because the overall idea isn\'t that original. (Kids trapped in a creepy Elementary school?)  I\'m glad I decided to push through to the ending, though.Art:Eh, it was your average anime style. It wasn\'t cheap, but it wasn\'t amazing either. The only prominent part of the art was the massive amounts of gore.Sound:Pretty good. I liked the opening song a lot and the soundtrack really set the mood.Character:They did a good job of introducing the characters in such a short amount of time. I became pretty attached to some of them after just 2 episodes. (I don\'t recommend doing that, though, haha.) The characters were all pretty different so you got to see different reactions to the horror which was good. My favorites were Satoshi, Ayumi, and Seiko.Enjoyment/Scare Factor:To me, this anime wasn\'t really scary, per say. It was most just nasty. I wouldn\'t even say that it was disturbing: to me, I\'ve heard of waaaay more disturbing horror premises. But I have to say, the guts and gore in this anime were on point. I felt kinda nauseous throughout watching it just because... can anyone die a peaceful death? Nope. If you\'re into that, then you\'ll love this anime. The selling point is its massive amounts of spurting blood. There are some pretty creative deaths!I\'m going to give this a 7 overall because I got through it and the ending was pretty damn good. The first three episodes are kinda slow, but it\'s worth it in the end. And if you\'re easily scared, than they probably wouldn\'t be that slow, haha. I\'d say the anime is a lot scarier than the game just because of obvious reasons (the game is literally pixels). And did they hire the same VA\'s as the game? If not, they were extremely similar which was cool!To sum it up: watch this if you love blood and like a good ending. into play in the last episode.

Last year, one of the things I looked at was Corpse Party: Missing Footage, a short OVA about a bunch of one-dimensional characters being dull. We saw a bit of blood and carved up children at the beginning, but nothing else to connect it to horror. This year, I'm going to look at the follow up that, supposedly, moves into straight up horror. Corpse Party: Tortured Souls.Story:A group of eight kids is staying at school late after an event and telling ghost stories. Before leaving they, along with their teacher, decide to do a...charm that will supposedly make them stay friends forever. This naturally results in them being separated & transported into a dilapidated school where blood and gore are everywhere. Now, they have to find a way to rendezvous and escape before a group of vengeful spirits can add their bodies to the décor.In theory, this is a good premise for a horror piece. It's relatable with characters who are separated through no fault of their own as opposed to the old cliché of them just splitting up because they lack sense. It could also give the audience a real air of mystery and intrigue. In theory, this is a great set up. But this is reality and theory only gets you so far. With that in mind, let's discuss the execution, shall we?Any potential this OVA may have had for horror is quickly ruined by the execution. It's over the top, ridiculous and very similar to a Hollywood B-movie. As a result, the scares end up being a bit humorous and not even remotely frightening. The pacing is also an issue. The OVA skips over a lot of plot details, I'm guessing because the game is longer. Even with that in mind, this has the unfortunate consequence of making several plot details come across as vague and poorly explicated upon. It doesn't help that the narrative itself is uninspired and trite.Characters:When I reviewed Missing Footage, I talked about seeing snippets of the everyday lives of a bunch of bland non-characters. But that was barely over ten minutes long. Surely, an OVA that runs for nearly two hours total would have to have better developed characters, right? If you answered in the affirmative, prepare for disappointment. The cast remains a group of caricatures of stilted stereotypes with no chance of connecting with any of them because they barely resemble a representation of human behaviour.The worst is definitely Yuka. She's a middle school kid who acts like she's four, right down to asking her brother to take her to the potty while doing a stereotypical pee pee dance, and it's excessively annoying. Compounding the annoyance factor is that all of the other characters treat her like she's perfectly normal. Because telling your older sibling that you have to potty is totally an age appropriate thing for someone who's fourteen. It doesn't help that these people are all really stupid and inept. There's also a plot element where, and this is a minor spoiler, the distorted space where they're sent causes people to lose their minds and go psychotic. But there's no consistency since we only see shades of it with a few characters and the rest seem to be immune for some reason. Maybe the game explains it, but in the OVA it makes no sense.Art:The character designs and such are really generic but what I really want to focus on, in this case, are the horror elements. Mainly because they are really funny and I'm not sure how Asread looked over what they'd done and thought it would be horrific. There's a black shadowy monster that looks incredibly silly and instantly ruins any sense of tension when you see its face in the first episode and inevitably burst out laughing. There's another monster based on an anatomical model that's similarly goofy looking and just makes you laugh when you see him. This is supposed to be legitimate horror and not a parody, right?Then we have the gory scenes, and there are quite a few. I'll admit, that I'm the type of person who can get really grossed out by gore, particularly when it's realistic. In this, the gore is so overblown that it quickly loses any impact. The death scenes are another big failure on Asread's part. They're so over the top and ridiculous that they end up having no impact or being unintentionally funny. I should not be laughing this often when a series is actively trying to scare me. There's also the issue with class, or lack thereof in this case. There are several unintentionally funny scenes that decide it's a great idea to give the audience a shot of a female character's knickers, usually when she's being menaced by something or murdered. And that's just in bad taste, Corpse Party. It would seriously undermine the gravity of these scenes if they weren't already unintentionally funny.Sound:The vocal performances in this are really over the top and there's a lot of over-acting. It adds nicely to the B-movie aesthetic that the OVA has going for it. Except that the series is trying to be taken seriously so it comes across as pretty damn incompetent. To be fair to the actors, they really have nothing to work with, given how underwritten their characters are. The music is passable, if a bit underwhelming.Ho-yay:One of the girls is pretty heavily implied to be the caricature of the stereotypical schoolgirl lesbian. She even gets to share a moment with her equally uninteresting friend in the infirmary. But the impact is diminished by them talking about her friend's male love interest.Final Thoughts:As a horror piece, Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is pretty abysmal. Its attempts at being scary are met with laughter or indifference, the characters are absolute garbage and you aren't going to care what becomes of them, the performances are over the top and the art does not keep it classy. That being said, I do kind of recommend watching it. While it fails at what it's trying to do, it does it in such an absurd way that it's kind of amazing. It comes across more as a parody than a legitimate horror piece and, as a parody, it kind of works. If you've got a macabre sense of humour, this might just be what you're looking for. Still, I have to give it a 2/10 for its many, many, major failings as a horror piece.

Next week I'll continue the month with Night Walker: Mayonaka no Tantei."", 'Easily one of the goriest and most viscerally enjoyable show I’ve ever watched.The Short Version:(+)The soundtrack layers fear upon you.(+)The art is pretty good.(-)None of the characters are memorable.(-)The violence is a bit stomach turning.The Story (5/10): The story behind this show is, when you actually pay attention, very confusing. A bunch of kids try out a school urban legends and call forth a wicked spirit, which in turn transports them to a different dimension filled with ghosts wanting to kill them… Or you could just expect a standard gorno horror flick and take bets on whose going to die first. The ending of the...anime is predictable and left me a little bit angry, I won’t say why because of spoilers, but I wasn’t very happy. The ending is predictable and isn’t really great in any way. That and I’d didn’t really like what happened before the final credits rolled.The Characters (4/10): I’d normally list off the main characters and give a quick description of each to give you a general idea of the character themselves, but it’s really not worth it with this show because most of the cast are here to die and that’s it. The important characters are the ones doing the killing, because behind them is the entire mystery of what exactly happened in the school this show takes place in. I’ll say that the way some of the characters die is straight up gut-wrenching. One involves a pair of scissors, another a very sturdy wall, and yet another that I just don’t want to remember because of how cruel it actually is.The Art & Sound (8/10) & (7/10): These are the areas in which this show absolutely shines. The art is the show is great, considering it was done by Asread, whose other works include Mirai Nikki and Yuushibu, I probably shouldn’t be surprised. When in motion the movements are very fluid and with static characters/object the overall quality is some top grade stuff. However, the place where the art really takes over is in the scenes where people are dying, the sheer amount of blood on screen made me have the reaction of, “Ease up on the gore.” The level of detail on human organs is something you’d expect with a medical drama, not a horror anime.The sound of the show is another strong point, not necessarily the OST or the OP & ED, but more the voice acting and some of the general sound effects. When a character laughs in this show I unconsciously check behind me to make sure nothing is there, and especially the children laughing. The shivers I get are uncanny. The voice acting for all of the voiced characters are exceptional are well, when everything is going to hell, you genuinely believe that the characters are fearing for their lives and panicking like anything, and when the characters starts dying. Well. You think people are actually being slaughtered in the next room. At least that how I felt.What do you think of this show?Don’t watch it in the dark, and have a bucket on hand just to be safe.Would you recommend this show?If you watched When They Cry, you’ll find more of the same here. Otherwise I can’t really recommend this show, you won’t be missing out on much.Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next one. anime is predictable and left me a little bit angry, I won’t say why because of spoilers, but I wasn’t very happy.

Sad to say, but Corpse Party just can\'t compare to any of those when it comes to quality. However, in terms of blood, gore, and (brutal) deaths, Corpse Party has a nice niche that lets it compete with the other bad boys....***Spoiler Free***Story (6): Pretty straightforward. A bunch of innocent Highschool kids get transported to an old, abandoned Elementary School after performing a sort of ""charm"". From there, the fun begins with a story interesting enough to keep you watching.Art (4): While there is nothing really bad about the art, I found that it didn\'t really suit the anime well. Its a bit too colorful for the creepy/scary atmosphere it tries to set. And occasionally, it made the gore look awkward or too fake.Sound (8): Probably the most impressive thing about Corpse Party. In addition to great music during the opening, Corpse Party manages to set the Horror element perfectly during scenes that are meant to be creepy or get you on your toes. The anime also knows when to NOT have music playing,  which in itself really impressed me.Character (3): There is literally nothing unique or interesting about any of these characters. Barely any of them even got any exposition or development at all. In fact, I disliked most of them for how stupid they were. I guess it made their gruesome, bloody deaths that much more enjoyable, so they got that going for them.Enjoyment (6): There\'s nothing I hate more than having to turn off my brain for an anime, and this anime was no exception. Characters in most of any film, anime, novel, etc. in a Horror tend to be dumber than sacks of potatoes for some reason. Honestly, most of the characters could have survived if they simply stuck together, which is a taboo in any Horror. When you do turn of your brain though, this anime presents very well executed, gruesome deaths, and under the right conditions (At night, with headphones on) can actually be a pretty creepy anime that might make you jump once or twice. Pacing was also pretty spot on for a short anime.Overall (5): I had fun while watching Corpse Party. I\'m a big fan of Horror and gore-based animes, and although Corpse Party wasn\'t as good as I\'d thought it be, I guess it lived up to its reputation (barely).If you\'re also a fan of Horror animes, Corpse Party is basically an essential watch for you since it\'s both well known and not a complete let down. Also, it\'s only 5 episodes long including its short OVA, so you\'ll get it out of the way fast if its not for you, or complain that it wasn\'t longer. Do prepare for major cliches\' however. But I do recommend watching this at night with headphones on for the best experience. ***Spoiler Free***Story (6): Pretty straightforward.

It’s the perfect package for horror genre enthusiasts or a perfect gateway anime for those trying to get into the genre.The story is set in Heavenly Host Elementary School, which is an elementary school that was torn down following the murders and disappearances of several of its staff and students. By the start of the story, another school called Kisaragi Academy had been built over the elementary school site. One night, a group of students from Kisaragi Academy...are telling ghost stories when suddenly earthquakes start to take its course all around the campus. This earthquake was not your average one, oh no, it was a supernatural earthquake that transports the group of students to another dimension where Heavenly Host Elementary still exists! And, might I add that it is still haunted by the ghosts of the school's murdered children. The students of Kisaragi Academy try to find their way home and survive the other mysterious forces that haunt the school, all at the same time.Our cast consists of your generic high school students, a little sister, and a teacher more moe than anything I can think of! There’s the main male protagonist that everyone likes and he’s also the little sister’s older, protective and loveable brother, clingy little sister, a love triangle, best friends, a character that loses their sanity and goes psycho, and the one-sided love. So, as generic as the cast may be, there’s something there for everyone, or at least most of us.NOTE: Considering that this is only a 4 episode OVA, because the anime was derived from a video game, I won’t go too much into detail about what happens with the characters, for the sake of not spoiling anything.The character development was decent to generic as well. Consisting of the cast facing long hidden feelings and fears. Maturing because there is no other choice. Trying to become the hero, and realizing the worst is yet to come. Aside from all that, the characters’ development was in sync and corresponded with each and every scene. I really enjoyed how well their personalities adapted to each scenario and made them really relatable to real life situations.The animation for Corpse Party was done by, Studio Asread. If you don’t know who they are, well, they’re the same group of people that did the animation for another, well-known horror anime, Mirai Nikki, or in English, Future Diary. The animation was done phenomenally! The environment in the Heavenly Host Elementary School was grotesque, with a dark and evil ambience that spread and lurked through every corner. Studio Asread brought a make believe haunted school to a real life blood bath with a death sentence waiting to catch anyone off guard. The deaths scenes were fluid with emotional and psychological effects, not only on the character, but on the watcher as well. It either will sicken you to your stomach or get you hooked! It truly brings out the sadist in you… just kidding.I do want to touch on some negative factors before I give my final rating for this review. Length was definitely against this anime adaption. Considering that its an OVA, I believe if this was given, maybe an extra 3-4 more episodes, the plot could have been extended and the authors could have added more detail to the plot. Making it a complex horror story with depth in emotion and end game. I felt that some of the deaths and killings were rushed, going back to the length of the OVA, and would have had a greater impact on the plot and on the watcher’s emotional attachment to a character, making it more of a relatable feeling of despair and hopelessness.Overall, I give this anime an 8 out of 10 and I definitely recommend it! Aside from all the good points I have been giving it, length did not do this OVA justice. Being derived from a video game, the creators already had dialogue, scenes, characters, and a plot to work with. Maybe time wasn’t on their side and the best they could do was only a 4 episode run, or maybe it was the lack of horror anime on the market that made them take a safer approach to the scene, but I won’t hold that against this. I definitely recommend this to anyone that loves despair, hopelessness, horror, blood, and the supernatural. If you can’t hold your own when it comes to any of that, definitely skip this, for it is very disturbing to the norm. are telling ghost stories when suddenly earthquakes start to take its course all around the campus.

I watched this show as it was recommended by a friend as a horror show but this was too extreme.  I usually tend to agree with the reviews of my peers on MAL but in this case I did not.  I'm not going to spoil it for you but I must warn you of the EXTREME GORE this show is chock full of.  It also has some well known voice actors that I like so that lulled me into a false sense of security.  In my opinion, this show is extremely depraved.  Don't know who...came up with it but this has to be one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen.  I don't recommend it and I'm going to do everything I possibly can to forget it.

The pacing was far too fast and it strayed from the plot of the games a little too much with some of the character deaths, but that's my only complaint, really. The best way to look at it is that it's the Wrong End that didn't get put into the game. If you don't like gore you REALLY will not like Corpse Party, there's people dying left and right in the OVA and games. I swear the atmosphere in the games is the worst part, I was tense as hell playing...them.

All of these are my own beliefs and I do not expect anyone to completely agree with them or agree with them at all. But as a person who have watched almost all genre of anime, and countless number of shows (I do not really feel like adding all to my profile), I believe my opinion may help someone who has trouble deciding ""Corpse Party: Tortured Souls"" is worth their time or not.*The review is spoiler free.Story:The story is absolute nonsense.

The buildup was ok, although the story was missing the ""sitting at the edge of your seat"" moments. I didn\'t cringe in fear once, but were mostly just grossed out by all the gory scenes.It was also really easy to figure out who the ""real"" villain was ( pretty much guessed it from the start).I think a reason for the lack of frightening moments, may be partially blamed on the intro ( it contained way too many spoilers...! ). As well as the fact that it was kind of ""flat"", and didn\'t really move forth after the second murder.Other than the fact that the main characters lacked personality, the other ones had the feeling of being more of an accessory to the plot, rather than actually being a part of the story.The art and sound was better than average, although it often lacked the finesse in how to portray height ( the characters often came across as quite short and ""compact"" ). The sound was good, but the music would often ruin the buildup towards a ""scary"" scene.I don\'t recommend it if you are looking for an anime with ""breath-catching, heart-stopping"" moments of utter fear, but if you are searching for a more  (like I mentioned before) gory and splatter like anime, this would definitely fit what you\'re looking for. It really has a lot of rather disgusting scenes!All in all it was an ok horror anime (didn\'t really suit my taste), but could absolutely be of worth to someone who don\'t like the super scary stuff, and would rather watch the more bloody n\' gory stuff.Hope this review is useful to someone :)It\'s my first time writing one :P ! ).

Those three would be Another, Mirai Nikki, and of course, Corpse Party. However, Corpse Party is different from the other two I watched as it is basically completely horror-oriented, whilst the other two have mystery implemented into it. However, even though Corpse Party did do well enough in the horror element itself, the subpar feel of most of the other aspects of the story kept it from being some kind of brilliant masterpiece.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Story:The start of the story feels very formulaic to most media...in the horror genre. For the first half or so of the first episode, everything is lighthearted and fluffy, until EVERYTHING GOES TO SHIT. The actual plot of the story really isn't that great in the slightest, but lets be honest, that's not what you watch the show for. Sure, it doesn't make a bit of sense, but who cares?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Characters:Like many of it's spiritual predecessors, Corpse Party puts a lot of stupid characters that make stupid decisions, which of course lead to death and despair. When a character dies, you really don't feel any remorse for them, as you find yourself with you're hand in front of you're face when you realize how they kind of deserve to die. Well, that was for the students that were actually alive. You did get a bit of character development, but it wasn't handled in the best of fashions. It wasn't off-putting, to be sure, but it could've been quite a bit better, considering the things that were happening around them.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Animation:This is the one thing where I can praise this anime for. Although the character designs are standard, you can tell they put a good amount of effort into the horrifyingly gory death scenes. The color pallet used for this is very dark, which fits the anime basically perfectly, although you would assume so for a horror anime.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Sound:Nothing really grabbed me with the soundtrack. Nothing really stood out, even if it did accompany the visuals very well. The opening was definetely not that fitting. The singing just didn't seem creepy enough like I would hope it to be, and half of the visuals are the characters living out happy lives outside of the death school they have been placed in. The ending is nothing special as it is accompanied by scrolling credits. There is no dub, but even the sub wasn't that great, comparatively speaking, that is. The screams and laughs were bloodcurdling to be sure, but other than that, it was, well, average.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For what it is, Corpse Party is good enough for shock value, but nothing really more than that. If you want to watch something with immense amounts of gore in the middle of the night, this is probably one of the best things you will come across. Don't expect much more than that, however. in the horror genre. For the first half or so of the first episode, everything is lighthearted and fluffy, until EVERYTHING GOES TO SHIT.

The plot was great, but sometimes a little bit confusing. The art was very well done and clean, and it really pulled off the ""creepy"" effect. Don\'t watch it for the firsst time at night, you wont even want to look behind you! You felt a bond to the main characters that really made you feel for them, whatever situation occured.  If you like horror animes, I highly recommend Corpse Party: Tortured Souls. ', 'Corpse Party: A relentless, extremely violent, psychopathic, fast paced, supernatural horror... That\'s how i would summarize it anyway.Despite its overwhelming level of violence, there is (thank god) a very interesting story behind this short show. As you may know, this is an adaptation of the Corpse Party Game, and throughout, the plot as well as being horrifying and dark, is also very vivid, cinematic (thriller styled), and it does come across as well though out. Multiple times i felt like i was ""watching"" a book!In terms of presentation, the art (very important for gore), was very good, similarly, the blood splatter sounds etc. also came...into their own.Though, on the topic of sound: why is the intro so upbeat, for such a slaughterous show? it\'s a little unnerving if you ask me! Anyway... This combination of great art and sound went together to maximize the immersive nature of the show, the atmosphere is always suspenseful, keeping the viewer on edge at all times! It\'s safe to say that Corpse Party majors in engaging the viewer (over the story telling) - which explains the magnitude of the theme of death...I know I\'ve quoted this before, but what majorly adds to the viewer\'s suspense in this show is its unpredictability... Those of you who have seen things like AoT, or Another will understand the plight of constantly wondering: who\'s gonna be next? - like in many non-anime horror classics. Corpse Party takes this to another level though! Just like a stereotypical horror, (which isn\'t a bad thing) you get the impression here that ANYONE at ANY TIME could be abducted, randomly murdered etc. Soo... i don\'t advise picking favorite characters, unless you want heartache on top of the nausea!By far, the majority of pros for Corpse Party are tied in with presentation, and thriller devices - things to make the viewer edgy. This becomes apparent when i observe this really interesting, mysterious, story being RUSHED through too fast - it\'s quite weighty, and it bears a LOT of potential. But, as opposed to the gore scenes, it\'s always a bit too brief - think of it as fast forwarding between every opportunity to show someone\'s insides...It\'s a bit face palm inducing i think many completed viewers will understand: how the (very short) length of the show majorly cuts its potential in areas such as Story, and - Character development: which is quite minimal.Despite this, you should already have been prepared for a fast paced, bloody rollocoaster when you clicked on a 17+ Mystery / Horror that lasts about 2 hours total. So, fans of the horror genre won\'t be disappointed, but you won\'t have time to process what\'s going on either.Would i recommend it? If you\'re looking for a Pure Horror Thriller, definitely.In technical terms i should rate this a 6 for its rushed story and character dev - but my psychopathic appreciation for the gore bumped it up to 7 in terms of my enjoyment :P into their own.Though, on the topic of sound: why is the intro so upbeat, for such a slaughterous show? it\'s a little unnerving if you ask me!

There's scenes noticeably the same which makes it fun to watch.The storyline is very slurred, everything happens quickly which makes it feel like the anime ended too fast. The clues characters get seem to come from nowhere, we don't fully get to see where they find information.The art in term on how well illustrated...guts are, is pretty good! They don't do half-half they go all out with showing gruesome scenes!The sound I thought lacked for me because the voice acting wasn't the best, but it was all-right, sound affects could have been played with because some didn't suit the atmosphere at times.Characters are just based on how they act, stereotypical points groups seem to have like others have said the one that's always scared, confident one, creepy one etc. Also because of the shortage of episodes there wasn't a lot to go from.Overall I enjoyed it because of my liking to the game, and how this reflects on it, the game didn't have the gore which the anime gladly filled in and made up for it because it really made it feel real with the sound and visualisation of it!

The details are in fact in here, but they are very subtle to someone who has not already known the story.This OVA lasting only 4 half-hour episodes for a game that lasted 5 chapters, a few hours of game play per chapter, it is obvious that the timing is  a...bit fast to really sit back and enjoy. Still, it is a great watch for any Corpse Party fan. There is actually some music from the game incorporated into the anime and the detail of art is amazing as well! There is definitely a gross-out factor, but it\'s a nice change of pace from the don\'t-show-just-listen aspect of the video game.Now, this is NOT a retelling of Blood Covered, or at least not to a T. The overall story is the same, as in the events that have to take place, but some of the deaths have been changed. I won\'t spoil too much by saying who dies and how, but know that there are only 2 survivors by the end of the OVA, whereas there were 5 in the game. These changes are either from Wrong Ends from Blood Covered or written directly for the OVA.In my opinion, this version did not do Morishige justice, him desecrating the dead and attempting murder before his death (his death not a spoiler as he died in the game - if you didn\'t know that you should have turned back when I said you should see the video game first). But, with that and the timing, those are my only complaints about Tortured Souls.Those slight changes in the story are very intense and affect the outcome in such brutal ways.

This delivered exactly what it said it would, gore and plenty of it. The story in this show was quite confusing although it did end up fully making sense at the end. Other than that the rest of the show was quite mediocre. I think I may have liked it more if the characters had been more fleshed out and if the show had given me a reason to care about what happened to them. Overall this show wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. "", ""I am a huge fan of Corpse Party. I loved the game and the Corpse Party: Blood Covered manga, so I was really looking forward to this anime. Even if it was only going to be an OVA, I felt that was a great opportunity to capture the best moments of the game animated!--------------------------------------------------------STORY (4/10): When it came out, I watched it and the first episode was great! It was true to the game and the manga. But then it all went downhill around the middle of episode 2. The story became incredibly out of order, so many things were going on at...once, and it was just crazy. Now, I understand that the anime had to move at a faster pace due to the amount of time for each episode, however it could have been done much more efficiently. They didn't focus on the right things to make the story make sense.What I love about Corpse Party the most is the characters, their relationships, and the overall plot. I feel that this anime just twisted it all and distorted the whole meaning of it. My take of the game was that it revolved around the idea of friendship (I mean, it's a game about a group of friends that are trapped in Heavenly Host Elementary and have to work together to get out). The anime did not portray it that way and focused more on the gore and shock factor than the aspects that I find to make Corpse Party unique.ART (8/10): The animation was beautiful though, and they also did a very good job with the atmosphere and backgrounds. The gore/horror scenes were very well animated.SOUND (9/10): The music was great (the opening song is amazing) and the fact that they used the original voice actors from the game was a plus for me. The sound was the highest point of this anime, I would say.CHARACTER (6/10): *SPOILERS* (you can skip)Since most of the characters died, including the ones that were not supposed to, originally, I wasn't happy. I was so upset when one of my favorite characters that was not meant to die in the true ending... died. I know it's Corpse Party, but the true ending was so interesting and one of the best parts! The decisions that the characters made who actually survived carried the story in the game, but those characters didn't last the anime, so the cool character moments/plot points were missing.Major relationship and character developing scenes were cut out, such as the pool scene with Ayumi and Yoshiki, and the end where the characters realized that they were the only ones to remember their friends who died. Those were impactful scenes and should have been included rather than some others.*END SPOILERS*ENJOYMENT (6/10): As a fan, I enjoyed it in the beginning, but I am more interested in plot than I am in the gore. It may have been great for gore fans, but those who hold more importance in story will probably have a hard time enjoying this. The plot is just gone by episode 2.OVERALL (4/10): So, overall,  it was nowhere near as good as I was hoping, but it did have its positive points. However, those good points were not enough to make the destruction of the plot better in my opinion. I don't suggest watching it if you are a big fan of the original game and its story, but if you love horror and gore, and don't mind the character development much, then go for it! once, and it was just crazy.

There aren't very many jump scares which is a big plus for a scaredy cat like me, but the graphics of the corpses can be uncomfortable for people who aren't used to such graphic images. I recommend watching this well after you eat or well before since this can get your stomach twisting and turning.The story is pretty cliche for a horror story and if you've played the game,...the anime leaves a lot of it out. Not surprising since they had to fit the whole mystery of the Heavenly Host Elementary School into two total hours of screentime. But they do fit the more important aspects into the anime and it's not lacking in the violence and creepiness the game brought us.The only aspect lacking in the whole storyline is the character development. They have to leave a lot of it out due to, once again, the four episode cap. The characters themselves were pretty cliche in the first place for a horror story that's centered around a bunch of teenagers. The airhead, the occult freak, the delinquent, the initially pretty crazy guy, the calm collected one, etc.Overall, in comparison with the game, not bad.

So my review is mainly negative.briefly, comparing to the original game, it\'s a fail.Bad points:-the story is largely modified, some scenes are changed to be rather absurd.-important connections among characters are not clarified.-the flow of story (especially e.p.1) is way too fast, the whole story is rather like a collection of this or that famous event of the game, it lacks proper transition between scenes/episodes.-as an OVA, the character\'s artwork isn\'t well drawn.-fans of the game (like me) are not satisfied by the story, they can pick up ""weak"" connections and butt in easily. people...who are new to it can be confused since the may story jumps too much.-it\'s not THAT horror.Good points:-the OP theme song is amazing.-the cast voices are unchanged.-it\'s gore. who are new to it can be confused since the may story jumps too much.-it\'s not THAT horror.Good points:-the OP theme song is amazing.-the cast voices are unchanged.-it\'s gore.', 'Fish-Snack day addition #2..:  This review contains spoilers, so feel free to skip directly to ""Enjoyment and recommendation guidance"" section, or start right away to watch OVA series to get back to it  :..Before cut to the chase, it\'s important to wonder about the right questions. Does this series achieve to install a certain climatic atmosphere? How is it as a standone, in relation of the video game of the same name?Overall rate was calculated, after I reflected about these points... Once more, you won\'t have I discuss of matters in separated sections, due to synthetic factor of anime itself. Now, that\'s being...said, let me expose you why I was overall unimpressed with that piece of work.One fond of horrific cinema, knows that this genre is very leaned on craftsmanship approach. These movies sometimes are personal works, whose marks are associated with some notheworthy figures as Sam Raimi or John Carpenter. But let\'s not sidetrack, too much... To get back in anime world, Corpse Party starts with a certain handicap, as it\'s a custom work made around the objective of being an accurate adaptation of a video game. Hence, any sense of artistic freedom is automatically ditched; it reduced the OVA series as a mere showcase of source per se. This statement is further backed up with shortness of length, which doesn\'t make for elaborated build up in a narrative standpoint. I have counted 9 minutes, to introduce 9 characters who are about to part ways in life, before perturbating element occurs. It\'s difficult to relate to their cases, unless you\'re on the same situation at the moment. This is then with a detached frame of mind I followed continuation. Up to the time of this review, I yet wonder why these high school students were transfered in dimensions encompassing an elementary school. Plot never addresses the question, but to believe it\'s related to a touching and yet childish ritual waters down seriousness I give rise to whole story. Indeed, I raised eyebrow, as I saw the 9 trapped protagonists evolve in what seems more like a haunted house of funfair, than a credible theater of tragedy. It\'s certainly not anime\'s fault, but the urban legend approach wasn\'t the one to adopt. Grotesque of situation is further put out, some victims exploding in an unrealistic farandole of burst blood pudding... As such, I considered the on-screen death of Mayu with a narky smile, rather than a back in shock. Also, I have yet what\'s with the bucketloads of blood and guts? Is Yoshikazu using it to give soil a certain redish brilliance or what? Disbelief caused by world building doesn\'t really allow me to comply. I like to have my things have a purpose as to why they exist, not only justified as to how it\'s edgy, cool or grisly looking. In addition of the negative points, some really underdeveloped character like Kizami, who butts in from nowhere, despite presence on Heavenly Host elementary school making sense. It\'s such a pity as he\'s a really cool character deserving more than the measly screen time he was given. Same can be said about Yui Shishido, who\'s the only trapped adult, after all. Instead of getting her unique point of view, her purpose is reduced to give her student a cheap spook at the beginning, before ending as cannon fodder whose death isn\'t even shown! However, I was highly impressed by cohesiveness displayed by Seiko character and... Nay, I kid, think of her as a lesbian who butters her hole with booty hemorroid cream. She hangs herself only because Naomi had a natural burst of anger... Who wouldn\'t get a fit of stress, being trapped in a evidently creepy place, even towards a dear one? Stuped is stuped and cheesily comic. This kills tension build up. I don\'t think that was the effect Corpse party tried to managed...

I’m no poet, and that was probably terrible, but I couldn’t resist.  For a proper plot summary, Corpse Party is the story of seven high school students, their teacher and a little girl who get together one night to tell a juicy urban legend that one of them heard online...   One that comes not only with thrills, chills and intrigue, but with a cute little charm that’s supposed to link all of them as friends forever.  But suddenly, and with no explanation, the charm backfires, and sucks them screaming and horrified into a twisted, disturbing world that wastes no time in splitting them up and running them through the meat grinder...  Almost literally in a few cases.In order to escape from this world that Silent Hill has screaming nightmares about, the dwindling students will have to solve the mystery behind the Heavenly Host massacre, examining the blurry lines between the truth of what happened and the story that became public knowledge.  And if that doesn’t seem hard enough, they’ll have to do this while avoiding the demons and ghosts who want nothing more than to spread their eternal suffering to others.  With the odds stacked against them, and no horrors being spared on their behalf, can any of these forsaken friends overcome their fate and live to see the real world?  Or are their tortured souls doomed to hell for eternity?The Corpse Party OVA was produced by a studio called Asread, a small time production company that originated as an off-shoot of Studio Xebec.  They’ve released a surprisingly small amount of titles, ranging from the misogynistic Shuffle to the plot-hole pin-cushion known as Future Diary.  By all means, you’d expect them to shaft a four episode OVA that nobody wanted to see with as little effort and money and possible...  In other words, this anime should look like ass.In spite of this, I was pleasantly surprised by the over-all look of this OVA.  Okay, it’s no visual wonder...  The budget was clearly a small one, and this fact is betrayed to the viewer in several scenes, most notably of which occurs right at the very beginning when the nine are saying their chant.  For most of the series, however, the visuals are executed nicely, teasing your eye with suspicious framing and backgrounds full of gritty, unsettling details.  Everything in Heavenly Host looks appropriately ancient, with the corpses scattered throughout the building in varying states of decay, and mold and grime covering every inch of the building’s walls.The character designs, while somewhat distinctive, are disappointingly generic.  You could argue that there’s a point to this, as there’s no real main character in this series(the protagonist from the game has been brought down to everyone elses level), and everybody looks like they could be a secondary or stock character in any other show.  You could make this excuse, and there is some logic behind it, but it doesn’t make the cast look any less dull or any more memorable.  The animation shines through in some scenes...  Where there’s suspense or gut-wrenching horror to portray, the animation becomes solid enough to make up for the over-all cheapness.  The visual effects of the ghosts alone justifies the unevenly allocated budget.  The music is just as spooky as it needs to be, and while there are no real stand-out tracks, it does it’s job well enough to amp up the tension and shock whenever needed.Before we go any further, I should probably mention that this OVA was based on a video game series that’s developed a strong cult following since it’s release back in 1996, despite not getting a sequel until 2008.  The series then took off, spawning countless new games and manga adaptations, as well as an eleven minute OVA that’s completely worthless and the four episode OVA that I’m discussing today.  Having said that, adapting video games into the visual medium is a notoriously hard thing to do, so how did this iteration of the story hold up?Well, I’ve always held onto the belief that an adaptation doesn’t need to be accurate...  It can change as much as it likes, as long as it manages to put forth a good stand-alone story.  The problem with applying that belief to Corpse Party is that, as far as I’ve seen from the handful of let’s play videos that I’ve seen, this anime only tells a fraction of the story.  Most video game movies will find ways to work around the gameplay aspect of their source material or just omit it completely, and that’s kind of a necessity in terms of keeping the story from getting repetitive...  But there’s a lot of story and character development in Corpse Party’s gameplay, and it’s sorely missing from the OVA.The first episode is executed decently enough, as it goes through the prologue and then spends the rest of it’s time focusing on two specific characters. They interact with each other and explore the haunted school for a bit, allowing the horror to set in with a very effective slow burn, leading to the first of many shocking death scenes.  However, the pacing issues become immediately apparent when the second episode starts, and the story suddenly shifts to cover the rest of the characters and their situations, as well as expositing about many of the rules and properties of Heavenly Host.I haven’t played the game, which is why I can say with complete sincerity that you don’t have to have any behind-the-controls experience to know that tons of material was left behind for the sake of adaptation.  This is most apparent from one particular scene where two characters figure out what they’ll have to do to put the ghost children to rest.  We switch focus to other characters, and by the time we get back to these two, they’ve already completed the bulk of the task.  The entire anime is like this, jumping from important plot point to important plot point, throwing away almost all of the mood and complexity of the source material to get through the story as quickly as possible.The mystery element of the story, which gave the game it’s celebrated sense of intrigue, isn’t slowly revealed as each piece is discovered...  Which I do believe they could have accomplished with an extra episode and a clever rewrite.  Instead, the entire backstory is dumped on you through exposition towards the end, and it grinds the story to a halt faster than the third act of the first Silent Hill movie.  It tells the backstory completely...  Or at least I think it does...  And they do kind of manage to tell it organically through the characters and their discoveries, and while I have to give them some credit for that, it doesn’t stop the sequence from feeling like I’m reading it out of a text book, and it spoils any feeling of immersion it may have had because of this.The characters also suffer, and not just in the literal sense.  With all of their development and background information glossed over, they’re simplified down to the barest of possible tropes...  You’ve got the class rep, the gropy lesbian, the genki girl, the obsessive fanboy, the blonde punk, the overly-attached idealized loli, the blank slate protagonist, etc.  It’s very difficult to become attached to any of these characters, which causes their occasional demises to lose a lot of the emotional impact that they should have had.  There are so many details I didn’t hear until after the fact that would have made so much more sense had I heard them in the show.  Apparently, two of the female character were competitively in love with the male protagonist.  Apparently, one of them was his childhood friend.  Apparently, this whole ritual was performed to strengthen this group’s friendship because one of them was about to move away.  I should have known these things!Hell, as little as I know of the game, maybe some of the obvious plot holes make more sense in it.  It’s stated that when you die in Heavenly Host, your existence is completely erased from the real world, which makes no sense, because the entire reason they tried this ritual is because of the blog entries of a girl who was already killed and trapped there.  Her blog should have never existed, right?  And I’m not going to throw out any serious spoilers, but what was up with that twist at the end?  What’s the logic behind that one?  Is any of this explained in the actual game?Now after all that bitching, you’re probably expecting me to say that this show is awful, and that it’s a poorly executed gore fest that doesn’t deserve any of your time or attention.  And in some ways, I guess that’s true...  So why do I like this show so much?  Why do I derive so much guilty pleasure out of what is so obviously a trainwreck?  To explain what Corpse Party does right, I’m going to have to compare it to another horror anime that I reviewed very recently, Another.These two shows have very similar plots.  They both take place in haunted schools where a bunch of unfortunate students are being ruthlessly killed off by a curse.  The differences, however, are vast.  The ghost in Another feels more like a sadistic mob boss than a vengeful spirit, while in Corpse Party, the ghosts are far more firmly defined and straightforward.  In Another, it’s hard to ignore the many ways that the curse could have possibly been broken, while in Corpse Party, the situation really does feel hopeless.  In Another, one of the characters has a power that she refuses to take advantage of until at least eight more people have died, but in Corpse Party, you can tell the characters are doing whatever they can to get home.  Also, unlike Another, Corpse Party doesn’t try too hard to look spookier than it is by arbitrarily making one of it’s characters obsessed with Gothic things.In Another, the body count seems to have an ulterior motive running contrary to the established tone of the series.  There’s a huge body count, but none of the deaths feel scary, as they’re either plot related, included for spectacle, or...  Well, I didn’t really talk about this in my review of the series, but a lot of the female deaths are sexually suggestive in nature, as most of the girls are killed through penetration, strangulation, and one of them lands in a sexual position after falling from a window.  It feels more like a sexually repressed revenge fantasy, with the ghost serving as a self-insert character, rather than a genuine horror title.Corpse Party doesn’t have that problem.  It’s difficult to get attached to the characters, so their deaths aren’t going to break your heart, but they’re still framed and executed in terrifying ways, feeling exactly as horrifying and nauseating as they were meant to.  Even if you don’t care whether or not the characters live, you still feel the pain and terror that they feel.  The deaths aren’t played over-the-top for spectacle, neither are they sexualized, save for one or two incidental panty shots.  Yes, there's stabbings and strangulation, but the way they're presented is so gruesome and gritty that even the most hardcore gore-porn addicts wouldn't be aroused by them.  In this way, Corpse Party succeeds in the most basic of ways...  It’s genuinely scary.  The pacing, while bad, still allows for suspense, which makes the inevitable splatters all the more crushing, even though it feels kind of cathartic to see so many annoying archetypes killed.  Either way, no death ever feels hollow or pointless to the narrative.But I think the main reason I like it so much is because it’s the perfect Japanese equivalent of a slasher film.  The vast majority of those kinds of movies aren’t good by any means, but they’re still so fun, gory and cheesy with no pretensions  of being anything more that they’re a blast to watch on a dark and stormy night, whether you’re alone or with friends.  At only two hours long, it doesn’t waste any time between scares, making it the absolute best anime to watch on Halloween.  I’ve always loved gory horror films that are perfectly fine with people seeing them for exactly what they are, and Corpse Party makes me nostalgic for the days when I was a teenager, watching grindhouse horror movies at my friends houses while my over-protective parents didn’t know about it.  I get that it won’t have that value with most viewers, but it has it with me, and that’s what counts.Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is not available stateside, and neither are any of the other iterations of the franchise.  The mangas and light novels have not been officially translated, although it is possible to play a subbed version of the original game online.  Neither this OVA series nor the abysmal eleven minute one that preceded it have been picked up for US distribution, although it is possible to watch both of them for free on youtube.  Malayasian bootlegs exist on Ebay, but...  Well, you know how those things are.  Proceed with caution.I normally wouldn’t like the fact that a show was as unavailable as this one is, but in all honesty, that scarcity actually works in it’s favor, making it feel even more like a back-alley bootleg of a show that you’re not supposed to be watching.  That appeal is limited, however, and I can’t justify giving it credit just on the merit of my own guilty pleasure...  It’s a train wreck, frankly, and while the many things it does wrong do prevent me from giving it any kind of firm recommendation, the few things it does right are important enough to save it from being completely unwatchable.  I give Corpse Party: Tortured Souls a 4/10. A simple chant will bind you as friends,So why don’t you give it a try?But make one mistake and that’s all it takesTo suffer and surely to die.When wandering these decrepit hallsBe brave, be clever and trueFor many a soul has been trapped hereAnd the next one might be you.Sorry about that...

Is any of this explained in the actual game?Now after all that bitching, you’re probably expecting me to say that this show is awful, and that it’s a poorly executed gore fest that doesn’t deserve any of your time or attention.  And in some ways, I guess that’s true...  So why do I like this show so much?  Why do I derive so much guilty pleasure out of what is so obviously a trainwreck?  To explain what Corpse Party does right, I’m going to have to compare it to another horror anime that I reviewed very recently, Another.These two shows have very similar plots.  They both take place in haunted schools where a bunch of unfortunate students are being ruthlessly killed off by a curse.  The differences, however, are vast.  The ghost in Another feels more like a sadistic mob boss than a vengeful spirit, while in Corpse Party, the ghosts are far more firmly defined and straightforward.  In Another, it’s hard to ignore the many ways that the curse could have possibly been broken, while in Corpse Party, the situation really does feel hopeless.  In Another, one of the characters has a power that she refuses to take advantage of until at least eight more people have died, but in Corpse Party, you can tell the characters are doing whatever they can to get home.  Also, unlike Another, Corpse Party doesn’t try too hard to look spookier than it is by arbitrarily making one of it’s characters obsessed with Gothic things.In Another, the body count seems to have an ulterior motive running contrary to the established tone of the series.  There’s a huge body count, but none of the deaths feel scary, as they’re either plot related, included for spectacle, or...  Well, I didn’t really talk about this in my review of the series, but a lot of the female deaths are sexually suggestive in nature, as most of the girls are killed through penetration, strangulation, and one of them lands in a sexual position after falling from a window.  It feels more like a sexually repressed revenge fantasy, with the ghost serving as a self-insert character, rather than a genuine horror title.Corpse Party doesn’t have that problem.  It’s difficult to get attached to the characters, so their deaths aren’t going to break your heart, but they’re still framed and executed in terrifying ways, feeling exactly as horrifying and nauseating as they were meant to.  Even if you don’t care whether or not the characters live, you still feel the pain and terror that they feel.  The deaths aren’t played over-the-top for spectacle, neither are they sexualized, save for one or two incidental panty shots.  Yes, there's stabbings and strangulation, but the way they're presented is so gruesome and gritty that even the most hardcore gore-porn addicts wouldn't be aroused by them.  In this way, Corpse Party succeeds in the most basic of ways...  It’s genuinely scary.  The pacing, while bad, still allows for suspense, which makes the inevitable splatters all the more crushing, even though it feels kind of cathartic to see so many annoying archetypes killed.  Either way, no death ever feels hollow or pointless to the narrative.But I think the main reason I like it so much is because it’s the perfect Japanese equivalent of a slasher film.  The vast majority of those kinds of movies aren’t good by any means, but they’re still so fun, gory and cheesy with no pretensions  of being anything more that they’re a blast to watch on a dark and stormy night, whether you’re alone or with friends.  At only two hours long, it doesn’t waste any time between scares, making it the absolute best anime to watch on Halloween.  I’ve always loved gory horror films that are perfectly fine with people seeing them for exactly what they are, and Corpse Party makes me nostalgic for the days when I was a teenager, watching grindhouse horror movies at my friends houses while my over-protective parents didn’t know about it.  I get that it won’t have that value with most viewers, but it has it with me, and that’s what counts.Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is not available stateside, and neither are any of the other iterations of the franchise.  The mangas and light novels have not been officially translated, although it is possible to play a subbed version of the original game online.  Neither this OVA series nor the abysmal eleven minute one that preceded it have been picked up for US distribution, although it is possible to watch both of them for free on youtube.  Malayasian bootlegs exist on Ebay, but...  Well, you know how those things are.  Proceed with caution.I normally wouldn’t like the fact that a show was as unavailable as this one is, but in all honesty, that scarcity actually works in it’s favor, making it feel even more like a back-alley bootleg of a show that you’re not supposed to be watching.  That appeal is limited, however, and I can’t justify giving it credit just on the merit of my own guilty pleasure...  It’s a train wreck, frankly, and while the many things it does wrong do prevent me from giving it any kind of firm recommendation, the few things it does right are important enough to save it from being completely unwatchable.  I give Corpse Party: Tortured Souls a 4/10."", 'Generally, there are two types of audience when it comes to anime adaptations - those who have followed the source, and those who didn\'t. The latter might find some amusement in the cheap gore and shock factor of the show, as ""Tortured Souls"" has been known to be one of the goriest entertainment among anime, often compared to the likes of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Elfen Lied. However, I feel that even if I haven\'t played the game, I probably wouldn\'t have gave a s*** about the characters either way, even with all those uncanny and gruesome manners of death.Tortured Souls is a...perfect example of a rushed anime. Five chapters lasting at least four hours of playtime (depending on your reading speed) are cramped into the four episodes lasting 30 minutes each. The writing is terrible, and the character motivations were utterly butchered due to either altered dialogue or scenes that were cut out. A notable example was the fight between Naomi and Seiko, where Naomi spews some impatient remarks that drive an angry Seiko away, making the latter look like a petty person (in the game, Naomi\'s insult is far more devastating because it involves Seiko\'s late mother). Because a lot of scenes were cut down, you have little time, if any at all to connect with any of the side characters. Both friends and enemies of the main cast are just shallow caricatures waiting to be murdered. The result is a lot of senseless and superficial violence that lacks the necessary context.The ending to the series is a great display of just how little the writers themselves cared about the characters, going for a cheap shocking death the likes of B-horror movies rather than offer any form of closure. It\'s the final insult on the beloved characters of Corpse Party and the entire franchise, leaving me with a bad taste as a parting gift.The animation quality also looks mediocre compared to many other anime, and not just horror ones. The animation looks washed out, like it\'s done with the cheapest technology available. The lighting quality is terrible, so it can often be hard to see the details. Even in terms of its much-praised blood and gore, it also falls flat on its face as it pales in comparison to Higurashi, where the very details of the gorged eyeballs and spilled intestines are shown in their full glory without cutting away. The gore in Tortured Souls, however, feels held back as if the animators don\'t really have the stomach to draw such grotesque images.There are a few things that kept me from giving the anime the lowest score possible, however. The opening theme, for starters, felt much more emotional than the video game version as it balances between bleakness (its opening verses) and hope (its chorus). It\'s a nice choice of song that feels thematically appropriate for a horrifying story about the gruesome fate of innocent little kids. In spite of my earlier complaints, most of the scenes and dialogue were faithful in adaptation and only look bad because a lot of context was cut out. Last but not least, and perhaps the most surprising of all, the scene with Sachiko at the very end is also done far better than the game version as it provides a nice closure for the little dead girl as well, and it would have made me tear up if not for all the bad writing that came before.As an adaptation, it fails on nearly every level. As a standalone anime, it\'s bad storytelling without proper pay-off. Those who seek two hours of cheap thrills could find them here in the forms of throwaway characters and b-movie gore, but there is so much of that already in American horror films I wouldn\'t know why you would put your soul through the torture (ba-dum-tss!). I regretted wasting my time watching this piece of s***, and I would advice horror fans to seek much more satisfying titles out there like Higurashi, Elfen Lied, Shiki, and even Umineko Naku Koro ni, another rushed anime that\'s much better made than this travesty. perfect example of a rushed anime.

It's so rushed that it feels like whole scenes are missing from it. The story gives itself no time to slow down and develop things like characters. Also, the shock ending is forced, and it's not explained well at all. This anime would have benefited from more episodes to develop the story more.Art: 7The art is one of the saving graces of this anime. It might not look as good as some other works in the same year, but it's still amazing....The atmosphere in this anime is also well done. Another thing done well is the character designs, and they all have something physically to tell them apart. Plus, the huge amounts of uncensored gore is also a plus.Sound: 7Another good part about Tortured Souls is the sound. The main theme is one of the best anime opening I've in years, and all the music fits in the anime. I simply like the soundtrack.Character: 1Because the plot was so rushed, it gave no time for any of the characters to develop. They've to go along with the plot. Some characters only get one scene of time before they get killed off as well. They also seem to make stupid decisions just for the plot.Overall: 4Even if the soundtrack, art, and gore of this anime is good, the story and characters bring the quality of the anime.Recommended for people who don't care about story and characters.

Typically that\'s not my cup of tea, I prefer the more cheerful stuff. However, this anime still manages to impress me and kept me wanting to watch more to see the final conclusion of the story.The story itself is very dark and also has a pretty big plot hole if you are paying attention, but it\'s still overall enjoyable.The gore is insanely over the top, but not in a cartoony way, instead it\'s very upsetting to watch (which is what they were going for).  And every time you think...to yourself ""oh they wont go there..."" they 1up you and show you something far worse. Aside from the gore, I really like the atmosphere the anime gives, it really puts you  in the school and makes you feel a part of the anime, almost like a video game.The characters don\'t have too much depth, but aren\'t too shallow either. An immersion breaking moment is when one character starts to see horrible things in the scenery for the first time, but continues without batting an eye or saying anything, which made me laugh out loud at how outrageous the situation was.Overall, if you want to watch a horror movie, pull up and watch this 4 episode series instead. It\'s about the same length as a real movie, and I guarantee it to be way more potent than anything in the theatres. to yourself ""oh they wont go there..."" they 1up you and show you something far worse.

Tokyo Ghoul, Attack on Titan (kinda horror), Another, Elfen Lied, Highschool of the Dead? Recognize these? Then, I introduce you to something a bit more gory - Corpse Party. Time to take the next step up from the not-so-scary/not-as-gorey anime that you\'ve seen in the past.I loved Attack on Titan and Another, etc. so I wanted to take the the next step up by looking at all the horror anime that exist! Then, I saw Corpse Party on the list so I thought, ""Oh- this looks interesting."" I click on it and then the \'ugly\' pictures and descriptions show...up. Geez.The reason I gave this anime a seven was not because I hated it, it was because of the amount of gore there was. The story plot was very interesting, students being trapped in a haunted Elementary School that they somehow transported to on a dark, gloomy night at their High School (which is built on the old Elementary School\'s site), while they all try to escape in hopes of not being killed, considering the fact that the haunted Elementary School consisted of many killings in the past. The art is an outstanding (ten) to me, considering the amount of blood and body parts involved in it. Already in the first episode (each episode is at least half an hour long/ 23 minutes to be accurate), there will be guts an blood and dead bodies in at least every minute of the show. It is very revealing when it comes to showing guts and it won\'t hold back on jumpscares nor showing/revealing dead people/bodies lying on the ground. The sounds of the anime are good, but the animation is what makes it scary, not the background music or the screaming and gasps of dying people. Characters are somewhat good. In the beginning you may think ""this looks like a regular high school-type anime"" but boy are you wrong. As soon as blood and guts appear and are added to that, then those characters will no longer be the innocent boys and girls that look all kawaii in their school uniforms. I\'m an average fan when it comes to horror shows but Corpse Party is way too advanced horror for me (unless you\'re crazy and can handle four episodes that last at least half an hour of guts, blood, intestines - oops, did I say too much? teehee~) Overall, it was a pretty enjoyable anime, even though blood and killing is pretty much involved throughout all of them.Oh- forgot to mention, you know that creepy little girl you always see in horror movies? You know, the one with the long black hair covering her face and she\'s wearing a long dress and usually stands in random places? Yeah- you\'ll see her from time to time, so enjoy that! Oh- one more thing, make sure you don\'t watch this at night (you\'ll only regret it later). Here\'s another recommendation, watch this anime with your friends or even your parents if you have to, or might as well don\'t watch it at all! Being around friends while watching is a great idea (trust me on this cuz I watched this alone, in the dark, underneath my covers, in the middle of the night - not a smart move, should\'ve watched it during the day time)If you are already scared of Another or Attack on Titan or even Blue Exorcist, then don\'t even try going further into it and watching this. Just, watch it at your own risk if you really want to (like me), and have fun daring your friends to watch it hehe~ up.

I literally had my mouth opened wide at the end, great job was done with this anime! Of course you don't get enough time to relate to the characters and y'know, bond with them.. As this is a very rushed version of the game, but nonetheless, it was very similar to it to my surprise! This anime didn't disappoint me one bit. c:Yeah, there are some great twists of events there which made me like it even more, I thought I was going...to watch the same ending I got in the game, but man was I wrong!

The premise is somewhat exciting and forced me to watch those 4 episodes. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the effective story of the anime.Since there are only 4 episodes, I didn't really expected a complex story, but there are way too many...plot holes and random scenes made only to add some blood and violence to the whole thing. After a while you aren't even surprised anymore by random murders that happen every 2/3 minutes. The worst part of it is that it isn't scary as an horror should be. Let me explain: Corpse Party doesn't have the most original setting, I've seen haunted/cursed schools everywhere in horror films and stories, even children's ghosts are one of the most common characters, so at least I was waiting for something scary to happen, but apparently this isn't the real objective of Corpse Party. Indeed it's all focused on blood and student's inner body parts, especially intestines, that, I'm talking about my personal experience, just cause disgust.So, nothing scary at all in an horror anime. Ok. Maybe it has some other strong aspects? Nope, just that. Even the will to find a way to get out of that hell of a school is hidden behind the stupidity of the characters that do everything to get killed in the most idiotic ways, but I'll talk better about in the right section. Probably the best parts were the beginning and the ending, they somehow satisfied me and incredibly rised story's mark to 4, the rest was just a bloody mess.Art & Animation 7/10Nothing to complain here, drawings were well made, I'm especially talking about the setting (school environment) that's rich of details and realistic. I've appreciated the difference they made between bright, safe places and dark, elementary school filled with ghosts and murderers. Gore and splatter parts were also nicely made, not really realistic but still enjoyable.Sound 8/10Even if there isn't any memorable OST, sound effects are well made. Screams are amazing, the sound during various killings/stabs/random splatter stuff is half way between disturbing and enjoyable, but it's overall perfect for the anime.Characters 3/10I admit that I don't really remember any of main character's names except for one or two of them because their name was actually shouted during the whole episode. This also means that it was hard to follow the conspicuous sequence of deaths and that I couldn't care less about their deaths, because I haven't even had the time to understand who or how they were.Leaving this apart, characters are just flat and unrealistic under every point of view. There are way too many situations that could have been avoided if they hadn’t been brainless creatures, I suppose this is a feature to actually make something happen, but it could have been done much better. They take decisions that are against every logic and the events seem forced, squeezed through the episode. I understand that they are just a group of 16/17 years old guys (but not only, there are some grown ups too) put in an infernal school but there are some times that you can’t find a way to justify their behaviour, you’ll probably understand better what I mean while you watch it.Thing to point out: characters are made of clay, literally, they explode/lose body parts just by touching things. That’s how it seem to work.Enjoyment 6/10Despite all his problems, Corpse Party is enjoyable to watch and it’s interesting to see how those characters manage to die in all possible ways. Sounds sick, but that’s what this anime is. I don’t think I’ll watch this OVA again, but I’ll have fun talking about it with friends.

For that I suggest your play the game this anime was based off of.The characters in this anime are not very deep nor do they go through much change throughout the anime. The characters you meet at the start of the anime are the ones you are left with at the end. They will not change much in relationships and they will not change much in who they are, this is just the type of story...Corpse Party is in this adaptation.The story seems like a simple folk tale and is nothing like the story in the RPG horror game. In the game there is a big plot and there is enough time to really develop the story into what it is. There is only four epsiodes of this anime and therefore there is not much time to go into detail about the story. There is only the main plot points from the game.The gore and horror in this anime is amazing. The great art and animation really makes it so you get the full affect of the gore these students are going through. That is one of the big upsides to this anime and also what makes more people enjoy it.Overall, I wish there were more episodes to allow enough time for character developemt and for the story to evolve to the one it is in the game. This anime is especially for those a fan of horror and gore, not a great chain of events or characters.

That is one of the big upsides to this anime and also what makes more people enjoy it.Overall, I wish there were more episodes to allow enough time for character developemt and for the story to evolve to the one it is in the game. This anime is especially for those a fan of horror and gore, not a great chain of events or characters. I did enjoy it though and it was the first anime that I watched so I would not be here reviewing anime if I at least didn't enjoy it."", ""Characters : 3/10The drawing is pretty bad, girl characters look very similar and every time it switchs to a different character, I don't recognize which character it is or even think it is the same.Sound : ∞/10This is probably the best scream sounds.

(THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR BOTH GAME/ANIME)as a really big fan of the corpse party game, i was extremely excited to learn that there was an anime adaptation out. never been disappointed in my entire life.lets look at the pros first though, the visuals are amazing - the gore in it does a fantastic job of leaving myself really disturbed by it and almost physically feeling the pain of the characters. the sounds are so eerie and so realistic also, as well as a good choice for voice casting for all of the characters. the op gives you an essence of whats...to come, a good job at meaningful lyrics and visuals, once again. if you want a really short, gory horror anime that relies on psychological horror instead of jumpscares, this is the anime for you.although, i let my attachment to the game get to the side of my overall score of this. the anime had SO much potential to live up to its manga and game counterpart, making me wish it ended in a different way. it would\'ve been nice if they gave even just a tiny flashback story in the middle of episodes for each of the characters, because we barely get to know any of them before they get gruesomely killed off, this therefore doesn\'t leave any lasting effect on the viewer. even the ""corpse party missing footage"" OVA still didn\'t provide that much in depth intel and information into the characters. we don\'t learn of seiko\'s brother, the fact that morishige and mayu are apart of the drama club in which that is the reason they\'re both so close, how ayumi and yoshiki inevitably became friends in the first place, kizami\'s horrible past, and most importantly, yui shishido\'s cat.i also wish the OVAS were extended to more than 4, as everything seemed so rushed, i understand they need to try and fit everything in 4 OVAs, but it leaves out a lot of the canon material and makes the viewer question what in the world is going on. a huge example of this is when yuka mochida and yuuya kizami meet for the first time, in a matter of minutes later kizami embraces his true side and stabs sakutoro morishige to death in front of yuka. the anime does a bad job at a buildup and rushed events like this makes me question ""whats even the point if you\'re just gonna leave out things that are so crucial to the plot?""for a very interesting storyline and really well developed characters like this, it deserves WAY more than 4 measly OVA episodes. its infuriating seeing all of your favourite characters being killed off when they weren\'t even in the first place, as a lot more people than two survived in the original.i really wish that this anime will get some type of redemption and that it will turn into a full fledged anime with much more episodes, living up to the original game/manga. or, better yet, they can follow up from book of shadows making it an anime adaptation, in which the two survivors go back to heavenly host to save everyone like they did in the manga/game. but hey, a girl can dream, right?

The story wasn't nothing compared to the game and well, only focused on the bad ending, so if someone watching had never ever played the game before at all, and was watching this ova, well lets just say they'd be confused and shocked by the end of it(that's what happened to me). There are good factors though to it, which gave me enjoyment of it. The horror and gore of it was very good for a horror anime, and does well to try to convey much of...the horror and gore of the game, especially the animation which goes into much detail, which do make up for some of the things . The characters are very much similar to the game's characters and do follow some of the story well to some extent. But, like i said, it is be best to watch this ova ONLY if you've played the game. The game is another story, and a good horror one at that, but the ova is nothing compared to it. If you wanna watch it go ahead, but believe me, unless you've played it or already know that base story of Corpse Party, you'll be defiantly confused by the end of it. One thing i wished is that they gave multiple endings like Higurashi did. the horror and gore of the game, especially the animation which goes into much detail, which do make up for some of the things .

This is my first review so please do try to bare with me here!This was something I had been looking for ever since I started watching a play through of the PSP game. Now I have always loved horror, I've just never mixed that with my obsession with anime, and when I did, I started with Attack on Titan, and I was hooked.I searched high and low for a good anime that I wanted to be one of my first gory and gut-wrenching show. I finally came across this 4 episode OVA and was ecstatic! It looked rather good after having...read the summery and a few reviews, and I decided what the hell, I'll give it a go.I just finished it about twenty minutes ago and I'm still trying to process some of the things I had seen. Indeed it stuck well with what I had seen of the game, and I liked that, but for me it wasn't gory enough. Yes there were moments when eyes were stabbed and hands punched not only through doors but through peoples stomachs that got me gagging and little yet also laughing at how great it was. I think I may be a bit of a psycho, oh well.I had been expecting a sort of mindless-blood bath sort of thing, but this actually had a decent plot line with it. Friendship, survival, revenge, and death. Those are the words that come to mind when I think about this. And that is basically what it is, you start with friends who always want to be together( sweet right ? ), then you mix in a charm gone wrong and a hell of dead bodies, dash some insanity in there, and you get suicide, murder, and death by splat. Its a mess for a while there, one after another people dying and blood flying until finally we settle down to finding out what the hell is going on. I didn't really enjoy the flash back as much as I did in the game, it was very void of detail and very quickly put together. I was looking forward to that scene, excited to see how they would write it. Sadly I was quite disappointed.After that we come to ending the horrid string of deaths, and even having someone fight an 'inner demon', I think they called it, and then bang we have a happy ending solving a few of our questions and with that said and done we head back  home. Only to have a major shock in the end. The shock well I was almost crying...Anyway, there are a few blank spots that I would have loved to have filled in, the principles son as well as that end scene, but over all I think it wrapped things up well leaving you guessing and wondering just enough.Story:: 7It did not live up to what I had expected sadly, and the story wasn't the most original thing I'd seen, but it was still good.Now for the art, I would say its fairly decent a bit more of the generic art style, or that was how it seemed to me. The fluency of the scenes where pretty good. I only had a few slight problems (only something I would think of I'm sure) with the blood, such as the way it pooled and how it would spray out, it made it all seem to fake-like in a sense, but like I said its nothing that would bother a normal person. As for the many expressions of the characters, they were pretty typical as well. But nonetheless I enjoyed it, simplicity can be good from time to time.Art:: 8It was okay, as I said I am picky on somethings so the reused type of blood circular pooling was a bit  hard to believe.Sound, I thought was great for the most part. Both the opening and ending are amazing and I think fit the theme well ( they are going to my favorites vault ), and the background music was fit perfectly. I had a few problems with the voices though, while for the most part, they were good, very fitting for the characters and such, I felt that some of the screaming just wasn't right. I could imagine it being a little hard to get a scream of agony or terror right without experiencing those situations yourself, but still some didn't even feel like the VA was trying. On the flip side, gurgling, crying, and such sounds were good, adding tension when needed. I had some problems with the laughter of some characters, it didn't sit right with me, but I am picky person as I said. I love to hear a good insanely crazy like laugh ever now and again.Sound:: 8A few things missing here and there, but overall not to bad.I enjoyed most of the characters; they were diverse, fun, and exciting, making each killing more and more enjoyable as it fit with its victim. I however did not enjoy Yuka's adorable little sister act. She is fourteen, she doesn't need to be child like which I think caused a lot of issues for her in the end. I was very upset with that end, I love both Satoshi and Naomi, but sadly they didn't end with a great big kiss like most horror movies these days. Some characters added enough light heartedness while some balanced that out with there bleaker perspective, then you also have the person who went insane ( okay theres two and i love them both), he was fun while he lasted. I love a good psychopathic freak so I defiantly found a few new favorites! ( Even if one did have a little sister complex... )Character:: 7Like I said they were diverse and made things even more exciting.I enjoyed my experience with Corpse Party even if it meant I only got 2 hours of sleep. It was different from what I'm use to and it wasn't like the movies we see so often on TV. It actually had a story. There was a reason for the killings and it told you them in a good amount of detail. I've always been a bit picky about what I watch and if I finish it and such, and I was surprised at how I finished this in just one night, I rarely ever do that. Sure it wasn't the best, I'm sure there is better, but I liked it for what I was looking for.Enjoyment:: 8Over all I will have to rate this an 8! Thanks for reading! I hope this an okay review... >_> read the summery and a few reviews, and I decided what the hell, I'll give it a go.I just finished it about twenty minutes ago and I'm still trying to process some of the things I had seen.

Just what fits in 4eps. I am not interested in the true-horror/gore genre, I watched it by curiosity, a new year\'s night :...I am absolutely not disappointed.It made me think about Silent Hill too. I didn\'t play Corpse Party game but anyone with a little experience in videogames will feel it like a game.[Sound]Nice, really good voice acting and songs as much as effects are well-coordinated. You know, when you think the shout is too long or the laugh so fake ... This is not what happens here. I\'ll say once for all, it\'s well coordinated.[Characters]Awesome. We\'re not in one of these fancy drama or comedy (which I like, drop that chair) with over emotional and completely irrational characters.

The whole animation is dark, in a movie I\'ld say ""the light show is really great!"". The blood is not just that flashy unicolor red nonono .. I really felt like it was a movie.I don\'t recommend it for those who are looking for ""a dark ambiance"" or ""a gore and/or violent anime"" it is different.Now, don\'t even dare to think once the first episode is over ; things can only get better.

So, I would tell all the anime enthusiast, who're planning to watch this anime, to watch this anime only for the gore.

The characters were dull and generic, and so were the ghosts. The only slightly intriguing character was the occult blogger, I wish they would have focused on her story more, it would have made for a more interesting 4 episodes.The plot is...very thrown together and stereotypical. essentially the characters must accomplish a list of tasks in order to escape their ordeal, there is no spontaneity, and no successful attempt to make the viewer relate to the characters which makes their gruesome deaths have much less of an impact on the viewer. If they left out the halfhearted plot and just stuck to packing as much gore and terror as possible into a half hour, I think this would have been more successful and enjoyable for it's target audience. very thrown together and stereotypical. essentially the characters must accomplish a list of tasks in order to escape their ordeal, there is no spontaneity, and no successful attempt to make the viewer relate to the characters which makes their gruesome deaths have much less of an impact on the viewer.

The trailer & every comment on here seems to only focus on the gore. Is there gore? Yes, but it\'s not just an open chop fest without meaning. There\'s an actual really good story line that builds up and explain every situation that is occurring and why the murders are happening. The undertone of Corpse Party gives off a strong sense of mystery, which is then overlayed  with horror. This is the best horror anime/ova I have seen so far. I\'ve searched really hard for new horror...anime and nothing comes close to Corpse Party. You\'ll hear people screaming out titles like Gantz, but Gantz is more Sci-Fi genre or Elfen Lied, which is more dramatic/suspense/gore.Sound:When it comes to sound, many just comment on the soundtrack. But I\'ve went to school for Audio Engineering, so I\'m going to be very detailed as possible. The foley work of the sound design team was phenomenal!!!! More phenomenal then actual live action movies. The grisly ooze of guts and the screeches  of knife shanks actually made Corpse Party really creepy. The sound is what made this anime horror, not the gore. It puts you in a mood of Alford Hitchcock flick vibe.  The  re-recorder mixer did a perfect job at panning at each footstep and breathe gasp to build dissonance of the disturbed characters.Character:At times I got angry at the characters, because it seem that the actions they decided to take, they deserved to die i.e ( splitting up after seeing your friend get killed, what?!?!) But the characters had their unique sense of personality and played their roles very well. I found myself at times screaming at my tv and saying  "" What are you doing!!!!!"" But hey if horror movie has you talking at loud, then it\'s really good horror flick.Art:The art work actually fits the anime and genre. I have watched animes in the past where the art is to flashy and poppy for the story. The artwork was done very cinematic looking, but not where harmonics of the characters over-powered the movement and the feel.Overall:Just go and watch it. I was reluctant to watch it at first because I dislike programs that has so much gore but no meaning.

However, it was very well executed, although the theme of the anime wasn't the most original (nor were the characters, but we shall look at that in more depth later in the review) it was still expertly put together, especially...when you consider the fact that they managed to tell the story with only 4 episodes.The art of this series is what really makes it stand out in my opinion - the horrific images and gruesome effects really made this anime amazing to watch, it wasn't at all tame or watered down, so it will satisfy anyone's need for a properly gruesome horror anime. There was some moments when I genuinely felt like I wanted to throw up, because of all the excessive gore, but I couldn't stop watching because they made it so gripping. Very well done.The sound was good, too - I enjoyed their use of it throughout the series. I also really enjoyed the OP and ED, the former of which I never skipped, which is unusual for me, as I am a serial OP-skipper. I don't remember any of the characters being particularly annoying voice-wise.Character was the only real place this series fell down, if only a little. The characters were, for the most part, quite generic and archetypal, with the exception of Sachiko - her character was interesting and really kept the story moving even before you really knew her role, she keeps appearing, and she's what kept me really interested in the story (as opposed to watching it to get my gore fix).I really enjoyed this anime. It did exactly what it set out to do - disturbed me slightly whilst keeping me engrossed. When I finished I was left craving more. So a pretty solid recommendation for anyone who enjoys horror anime. when you consider the fact that they managed to tell the story with only 4 episodes.The art of this series is what really makes it stand out in my opinion - the horrific images and gruesome effects really made this anime amazing to watch, it wasn't at all tame or watered down, so it will satisfy anyone's need for a properly gruesome horror anime.

It\'s a decent anime but the plot and general ability to follow what is happening gets a little confusing because of the whole ""fitting a 10+ hour video game into four 25 minute episodes"" thing, I can\'t totally blame that on them though they work with what they got. I think sometimes the gore gets so excessive that it takes you out of it a little, like it\'s so much that it\'s like wut is going on even. There\'s a lot of harm done to children so if that\'s...something that really upsets you, I would avoid this one. There\'s also so much unnecessary panty shots of teenage girls, but at least there\'s no SA other than a random boob groping in the beginning. Morishige is a little nasty freak which was fun to watch, and the ending was absolutely grim which I enjoyed. Opening song goes crazy hard. something that really upsets you, I would avoid this one.

Opening song goes crazy hard.', 'Before I officially start this review, it\'s worth the mention that I went into this anime with low expectations. It was advertised to me as blood and gore and intestines with some sort of plot that appeared every once in a while or something. While that\'s not completely untrue, that\'s not exactly what this anime is.Story: This aspect of the anime was a lot better than I had expected. I don\'t want to talk too much about the details, because you\'re only really getting two hours of entertainment with this anime, and most of the things I can say about the story will end up...being spoilers. Basically, a bunch of stupid kids end up going to a cursed school where there are evil spirits that try to brutally murder all of them, and they often succeed in murdering. But the story eventually develops into something more. Sure, it does some stupid and cliche things for the sake of convenience and intrigue, but aside from that, the plot seemed logical enough given the setting, and it seemed like they actually put some thought into developing the mystery and the motives of all of these evil spirits. It\'s not perfect, but it\'s good.Art: I was expecting the art to be very good, considering I watched this anime purely for the graphic gore, but all I can say is that it did its job. I really hate that I have an opinion on animated gore, but I do, and I have to say that this isn\'t the best or most detailed that I\'ve seen. It does its job, but the gore seems to rely more on shock than the actual animation. Some of the scenes didn\'t have fantastic animation, but they were sudden and unexpected, and that\'s enough to give you the impression that there is gore. They also had the typical anime blood, which means that whenever a character is stabbed, their blood will projectile all over the room and continue spewing itself like a fountain for a good ten seconds, because that\'s realistic. It makes for more laughable scenes than scary ones. Anyway, talking about blood is not my favorite thing to do, so I\'ll just say that the gore was okay.My one complaint with this anime is the fanservice. They would show shots of the girls\'s underwear as they were being brutally murdered, and I found that a little . . . distasteful. I don\'t like fanservice in general, but I can definitely understand the appeal, so I\'m not going to rant about it. But I will just say that the fanservice felt a little out of place. I don\'t know. I just find it a little gross that someone\'s face is being dragged across the floor by a demonic spirit, and at the same time, we\'re supposed to be enjoying some teenage girl\'s striped panties. I can kind of understand why they would add this in. ""The anime\'s already f**ked up enough, so let\'s just throw in some panties, right?"" But even still, it\'s a little unappealing.I don\'t have much to say for the sound of this anime. It was atmospheric at some parts, the sound of people being stabbed was probably more graphic than the actual art, if that makes any sense. The voice acting was good. And the opening was okay.THIS IS WHERE THE ANIME FAILS. The characters. I expected bad and boring characters, and that\'s what I got. I don\'t really remember their names, and I finished the anime thirty minutes ago. They were all stupid, naturally. Every horror story needs some stupid characters, because without them, nothing interesting happens. You couldn\'t understand the relations they had with each other, and you\'re just expected to understand that they\'ve known each other for a long time and they\'re good friends. They were annoying, and I felt nothing when they died.IN CASE YOU WERE SKIMMING MY REVIEW TO SEE IF I HAD ANYTHING HELPFUL TO SAY:-The story was actually pretty good.-The art was fine. The gore could have been better, and the panty shots were out of place and gross.-The sound was good, most notably the screams, the sounds of stabbings, and the sound of blood gushing.-The characters were ANNOYING.Overall, it was pretty good. I have my complaints, but most of them can be overlooked. It\'s a good gory anime, and also a great one to just watch with your friends when you\'re bored. Especially your squeamish friends. They\'ll love this. Trust me.I don\'t recommend that you stop everything and go watch the anime, but if you like horror anime and you get the chance, go ahead and try the first episode and see how you like it. being spoilers.

Generic characters you don't actually end up caring about or rooting for who respond to the situation at hand completely illogically, minor plot twist that you could see coming a mile away...

Inconsistant and strangely placed fanservice that was more surprising than the plot twist.Sadly, not even the quality of the art was redemptive for the Corpse Party OVA. It was nothing you haven't seen before. The...gore is not anywhere near as disturbing as it could have been - I mean sure, some of it was vaguely creative, but I was expecting better. You'd think that they'd put a little more effort into making it at least visually striking to make up for the idiotic copy/paste plotline.Literally the only good thing about this OVA was the last scene, and even that wasn't all that good.Not worth watching in my opinion. Not even so-bad-it's-good - it's just boring gore, stupid characters and an unentertaining plot line. gore is not anywhere near as disturbing as it could have been - I mean sure, some of it was vaguely creative, but I was expecting better.

Scenes of  brutal, gory, mean spirited, and vicious chaos. Un-confessed crimes of buried wickedness. If that is the sort of tale you seek, then by watching ""Corpse Party: Tortured Souls"" you shall not go unrewarded!The endless images of mutilation and violence stick with me almost as much as the chilling and cringe-worthy sound effects that accompany them.  From the art and sound effects stand point, it is a fine (albeit nauseating) production. The story is rubbish. Only a plot device...for various and brutal scenes of supernatural sensationalism in the form of disembowelment, eye gouging, dismemberment, torture, madness, and just Tom Savini levels of body parts being strewed about. I had to have a few drinks watching this.I will give this short series some credit for having the boldness to cross lines rarely seen in any form of media. But, they lose points by having take place in a school... albeit an elementary one. Sub vs. Dub? Only a sub exists for the time being. The characters are given very little time to develop and therefore stick to stereotypes and blandness. This series lacks any heart whatsoever and the twists in the plot, while eyebrow raising, lack appropriate power due to the short run time. Should this series have been longer? I want to say, ""Yes"" by perhaps 1 or 2 more episodes. But the idea that one would have to endure another 40 minutes of run time is unthinkable. I\'m glad it\'s short.

That\'s what I did and now I am getting some sweet nightmares. *sigh* Oh boy....(There will be SPOILERS in my review)[Story]: (6/10)The story is set in Heavenly Host Elementary School, an elementary school that was torn down following the murders and disappearances of several of its staff and students. One night, a group of students are telling ghost stories when a sudden earthquake transports them to another dimension where Heavenly Host Elementary still exists and is haunted by the...ghosts of the school\'s murdered children.Ahh, my very first horror/extreme gore anime. There are a lot of reasons why I don\'t watch Japanese horror. One being that Japanese Horror creeps the hell out of me way more than the American Horror. Corpse Party is no exception..I did say I watched this at night right? \'Course I did. Most of the time, I would be looking behind me because of my paranoia and there were times where I would need to stop for like 5 minutes because I was watching this anime alone.Now my opinions on the story...I am fully aware that the OVA was adapted from a video game and I am also aware that the OVA was not faithful to the source material. As someone who hasn\'t played the game yet, I gotta say the plot was ok. Although, there were a lot of plot points that was never explained because of the show\'s 4 episode constraint. There\'s also the fact that the show\'s pacing was absolutely rushed. I was still able to understand half of what was going on but I was left clueless on the other half. In my opinion, the show has a lot of potential to become a great anime series. The plot is there and it\'s a great plot. It just needs more episodesSo are the fear and shock factors present in the show? You bet your ass it is. However, there are absolutely no jump scares in the show. The show\'s fear and shock factors comes from the extreme/excessive gore itself. In other words, the show will mentally and psychologically f*ck you up for like a day. The show contains A LOT of gore which contains human guts, dead bodies/decapitated bodies, stabbing scenes, cut-out tongue scenes and more.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (8/10)The studio, Asread who also animated The Future Diary and one of my favourite anime Ga-Rei Zero, also animated the OVA of Corpse Party. OVA\'s don\'t usually have those top-notch animation that you mostly see in most animes these days so I wasn\'t really expecting the animation to be that great. The show\'s visual and animation looks fairly good but obviously not the greatest. The character designs also looks pretty good. However, they did an amazing job with the show\'s dark atmosphere which added a whole lot of creepiness to the show. The gore animations are disgusting so good job for the well-animated human guts, I guess.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (9.5/10)The soundtrack is pretty good but just like the animation, not the best. None of the background themes I heard were even remotely scary. Although, the laughing kids did freak me out. Now the OP and ED theme songThe OP theme song is ""Hoshikuzu no Ring"" by Asami Imai and the ED theme song is ""Hotaru-bi"" by Yumi Hara. The OP and ED theme songs are the reason why I rated the soundtrack of the show with a 9.5. The OP theme song sounds amazing. The singer just makes the song so damn beautiful while at the same time, the song has that horror flare in it. I also love the ED theme song because of the emotions in that song. It\'s like someone just died and the song is being used in their funeral or something.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (7.5/10) (SPOILERS)If you\'re thinking of falling in love with any of the characters or maybe even liking them then don\'t. If you like one of the characters maybe because that character is a lesbian, that one guy who everyone likes, the energetic girl, the little sister who constantly says ""Onee-chan"", the great big brother, and etc then prepare to get your emotions crushed as one of your beloved characters dies in the most horrible way possible.The characters get no character development at all...Maybe they did but how would I notice if there are only 4 episodes and the show is rushed? So you have to find another way to like the characters like I did.Oh and before I move on to another category. Everyone dies except Ayumi..""Ohh but Naomi lives too!"". Wrong, she killed herself after everything that has happened to her in that god-forsaken Heavenly Host Elementary.  “Heavenly” How ironic.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (1/10)Let me explain, do you really think I enjoyed this anime? Well, in terms of its horror then yea, I enjoyed it but did I really enjoy the anime? Do you really think I enjoyed all the character\'s deaths? Am I going to watch this anime again? Answer is No, No, and No.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]""Corpse Party: Tortured Souls"" might not be the greatest horror anime out there but it\'s still a good show to watch...if you want to scare yourself. If you\'re looking for an anime with deep and philosophical or whatever story then this is not an anime for you. It\'s simply for the viewers who wants to get scared or just wants to watch some horror shows. If you\'re a sick person who loves human guts then this is also for you.

While Corpse Party may be short with only four 30-minute OVAs, it sure doesn\'t disappoint with what little they can fit in this time slot. Without further ado, let\'s begin the review.Story/Plot: 7Of all shows I\'ve watched, there are only a few that create an interesting premise with little time to implement it. The story may not be as fleshed out as others, but is gripping enough to  warrant your interest and provide a rather satisfying conclusion that feels complete rather than...a cliffhanger, an abrupt stop that begets more questions. While the story was quite interesting, I felt that some of the deaths shouldn\'t have been there. Some of the deaths seem justified and rather well placed to the situation, but also they were some deaths where I scratched my head and thought, ""Did they really have to kill that character?"" or ""That was a weird way to off one of the characters and get them out of the script."" Regardless, they did well for what time they had and left me yearning for more as I watched.Art/Animation: 9Would you like intestines in your anime? How about some freshly pulled out eyes and clipped tongues? If you\'re hungering for these things, Corpse Party has it in spades. The art has a very modern feel to it while it does not shy away from its main selling point, the gore. While other shows might give you a character looking at an image and have them scream and have the camera pan out and let you imagine the worst, the camera has no qualms  with showing you what everyone else is seeing. The anime does not cop out when the going gets tough, and I have to commend it for letting the audience know. Animation is also nice, with little to no drops in quality in the action and providing clean shots to gruesome events.Sound: 9The voice actors present do an amazing job convincing you that what is happening to their characters is very real. The screams are especially done well, and the background music is very eerie, fitting with the mood and atmosphere of the show. I found the OP to be quite catchy and made me not want to skip even one of them while the ED seemed very forgettable and didn\'t resonate as much to me.Character: 6Since there are only four episodes, the main cast of nine characters are impossible to fully flesh out. There is no character development throughout the series as each one keeps to their cliche as closely as possible, but that doesn\'t mean the characters were all that bad. They did their part in helping the plot move farther along and provide a source of tension as to when or if they died to draw in the audience well. This is a plot-driven show rather than a character-driven show, so they do not need to be the most interesting cast to enjoyably execute an interesting concept.Enjoyment: 8Overall, Corpse Party is a show that does horror very well. They don\'t skimp out on the art to show how brutal it can be while also contrasting it with the bubbly and smooth art style of modern high school students. This contrast also helps make the story much more jarring, as the transition between the pretty and the gruesome provides a shock value to the audience, creating a more enjoyable and disturbing experience that everyone craves. If you liked shows such as Another and other horror anime, I\'d recommend it. Besides, with its short run time, you can marathon it as a 2-hour movie and not feel like you wasted alot of time if you don\'t like it. a cliffhanger, an abrupt stop that begets more questions. While the story was quite interesting, I felt that some of the deaths shouldn\'t have been there. Some of the deaths seem justified and rather well placed to the situation, but also they were some deaths where I scratched my head and thought, ""Did they really have to kill that character?"" or ""That was a weird way to off one of the characters and get them out of the script."" Regardless, they did well for what time they had and left me yearning for more as I watched.Art/Animation: 9Would you like intestines in your anime? How about some freshly pulled out eyes and clipped tongues? If you\'re hungering for these things, Corpse Party has it in spades.

That was quite the ova it was.Tbh I pretty much knew the whole plot and what happens from watching Pewdiepie playthe game and I also knew it some parts were different as well. But omg that had some nasty gorein it. I can't tolerate gore even though I always watch it (lol) but I swear I was on the verge ofpuking a couple of times.Overall the ova was OKAY I didn't it was that good just cause, its very average for a horrorova. The typical //everyone is trapped. Must find a way out. People dying. Spirits here and there,it was...just. Very typical. Like you could predict everything that was to happen so it was prettymeh to me. Plus, like I said, the gore I swear was just. G o d.But if you like gorey, horror, psycho stuff like this then you should watch it lol. just. Very typical. Like you could predict everything that was to happen so it was prettymeh to me. Plus, like I said, the gore I swear was just. G o d.But if you like gorey, horror, psycho stuff like this then you should watch it lol."", ""I have seen plenty of gore in my lifetime, including in many different animes. This show is definitely up there when it comes to having some of the most gruesome scenes (not saying in general, but for an anime).Story (6/10)Keep in mind, I have never played the game, so I went into the anime not knowing much of what it was. So, there is this elementary school that was torn down ages ago because of a series of deaths that took place in said school. A new school gets built over top of it. The students attending this school stay there late to tell some...spooky stories. It's all happy times, until they do this weird friendship ritual and then BAM! An earthquake occurs and everyone wakes in up in this freaky place, which turns out to be the old elementary school which was torn down. Now all the students are being attacked by enraged spirits of children who were murdered in the school. I'll leave it at that because all the rest would be spoilers.Now, the story is not very original. There are aspects of it along the way that make it interesting, but overall it wasn't very spontaneous. What kept me intrigued was the way it was executed. How some things played out, who died and, of course, the beautiful variety of guts and guck oozing out of the victims. That aspect was what made it a lot more thrilling than it could have been. Other than that, if you are looking for something with an interesting, thought-provoking plot, this may not be for you. This anime is mainly for entertainment purposes.Art (7/10)Animation flowed well and there were some nice, horrific shots and angles. The eerie atmosphere was definitely achieved and that is a very important aspect in horror. The backgrounds were well drawn. Character designs were decent and you could tell who the generic anime guy was right away (if you watch it, you'll know who I mean). What had impressed me the most in this category were the gruesome scenes, which were very well detailed and believable. I almost felt sickened. Overall, it was pretty standard stuff.Sound (7/10)The opening song is very clam and pretty, yet has an eerie tone to it. The ending has that similar effect on me as well. Both songs are well chosen. Now, the music used in the anime itself was pretty well done, from what I can remember. From calming to eerie to utter silence, it all impacted the atmosphere well and matched each scene nicely. I don't have much of an opinion of the voice actors because I watched the subbed version and I can't speak Japanese, so I wouldn't know what's good or not, but from what I could tell it was pretty decent as well. Each voice matched the character as well as the expressions that character was making.Character (5/10)None really stood out to me and I didn't feel that much sympathy when a few were killed off. Of course, this is only a 4 episode OVA series, so there was very little character development. Especially because the main focus is not the characters, but rather the incidents taking place in the story. Not to say the characters weren't likable, just not very interesting. There wasn't much learned from them that made the viewer sympathize or relate to them. Sometimes I just felt like banging my head up against a wall when I watched some of the brainless characters in certain situations. I guess, in every horror, there is always one really dumb person who goes and screws everything up.Enjoyment (6/10)I enjoyed it. Maybe not thoroughly enough than I wished I could have, but this anime wouldn't give me a bad impression on the game. I don't have much to write here because literally, after I watched it, I felt nothing. It's really only amusing to watch for fun, but it isn't something to go back to. You don't really get anything out of it, yet you don't regret watching it. It's just fun. So, if you feel like watching demon children rip apart some junior high kids, watch this show and be merry! I was!Overall (6/10)I have seen many different horror anime and films altogether and I wouldn't say this one comes close to being one of the best in it's genre. Story-wise, it was quite basic and unoriginal, yet the execution was pretty well done enough for me to like it. The reason I gave it the rating I did was because I enjoyed it, yet I wouldn't say it's very amazing. It's far from flawless, but it doesn't need to be amazing to be fun to watch.I'd still recommend this to fellow horror lovers and I am now even tempted to play the game to learn more about it.

For an anime that was only four episodes I give it credit cause it was amazing for a short period of time.~ART/ANIMATION~The art isn't anything special, but I did liked the animation. There was a lot of blood and the scenes were very...graphic which I liked a lot. It was well animated.I liked the way they animated when body parts would get cut off and some characters getting tortured. (No I am not a psychopath)~SOUND~The sound track for Corpse Party isn't really good in my opinion. Only when the scenes would get intense then good music would play. The opening wasn't really good, I felt that they could have done better. The sound effect were truly amazing, from the foot steps to body parts getting cut off. (No once again I am not a psychopath XD)~CHARACTERS~The characters... well... let's just say they're not quit special. Only one of them was a good character. There isn't character development since it is a 4 episode anime. It looks like the purpose of most characters are so they can be killed.

So this anime may be one of my favorites... maybe.If you like horror/psychological anime then you will love Corpse Party.

There were times I wanted to scream at the characters for not doing the obvious, but it's because in the game you don't have the option to do that. A lot of the story is left out and if you haven't played the game, not everything makes too much sense. You do get the overall plot though, and it was a pretty interesting story; that was the only reason I gave it the rather generous score of 7.All in all, I'm interested in playing the game now. I'm not sure...it's worth watching if you haven't played it, though. it's worth watching if you haven't played it, though."", ""For those that don’t know, the Corpse Party series started out as a computer game.  The original game and its sequel are now available as PSP/PS Vita games, and as of this writing, another sequel is set to be released in Japan soon.  I highly recommend playing the games if you haven’t already, or at least watching a play-through of them (preferably one with no commentary, as commentary tends to ruin the serious/scary nature of the game).Story: 6/10The story of Tortured Souls starts off very similar to the game’s, but the longer it goes on, the more it deviates.  It's not horrendously...different from the game’s story, but for those that have played the game, don’t expect it to follow exactly.I don’t know if it’s because I’ve played the games or not, but the story felt pretty rushed to me.  Everything seemed to be happening a bit too fast.  I feel like some of the story’s background could have been explained better and more thoroughly for those who don’t know the original story.  I feel that if I hadn’t played the games, I may not have enjoyed the story aspect all the much.Art: 7/10The art is a little iffy for me.  I found the beginning scene in Kisaragi to be of somewhat low quality.  There are moments in this scene where the characters’ faces look very awkward and disproportionate, and everything looks plain and lacking any real detail.  It feels very “bare minimum.”The huge saving grace for this category is that most of the anime takes place in Heavenly Host, where the art really picks up.  The gore is well drawn and does its job of being squick-worthy.  Being a fan of the horror genre, it didn’t really shake me, but it’s certainly not for everyone and could easily disturb those not used to violent, disturbing imagery.  The backgrounds in Heavenly Host are great—they’re very detailed and dark and help set the mood fantastically.Sound: 8/10The opening/ending themes are nice, and the background music is fitting.  The voice actors are the same ones from the games, and are absolutely wonderful—very convincing and suited to the characters.  The sound effects during the more graphic moments are wonderfully grotesque and cringe-worthy.Character: 6/10The characters simply aren’t given enough time to develop.  It’s so hard to develop a likeable, interesting group of characters in four episodes, and Tortured Souls just couldn’t do it.  While most of the characters have distinct, interesting personalities and backstories in the games, this anime isn’t long enough to properly showcase them.  Because of this, many of the characters come off as cliché, flat, and hard to sympathize with.  Yuka in particular was my least favorite character, though she has been in every single game/anime she’s been in.  The anime never out-right says it, but she’s fourteen years old, and far too childish and immature for her age.To me, the only characters I was particularly interested in were Morishige and Kizami.  They’re just delightful.  They don’t get nearly enough screen time though.Enjoyment: 9/10Even though the story is lacking and the characters aren’t fully developed, I still really enjoyed this anime.  I do think it important to mention that my enjoyment most likely comes from having played the games and already being interested in the series.One thing that took away a bit of my enjoyment for this anime was the completely uncalled for panty shots.  They’re just…so entirely unnecessary and situationally inappropriate.  I know the game had some of these too, but they’re just as uncalled for there.Overall: 6/10Whether you’ve played the games or not can be a huge determining factor of your individual enjoyment of this anime.  I’m really torn between recommending playing the games before or after you watch this.  While I think I enjoyed it more because I played the games first, others in the same situation may enjoy it less because it doesn’t follow the game’s storyline all that well.  Someone who hasn’t played the games/isn’t already familiar with the story might enjoy this more because they don’t have any pre-conceived ideas about the series, but they might enjoy it less because as a stand-alone anime, it’s not all that great.No matter what, if you’re looking for a deep, intricate story with complicated characters, you’ve come to the wrong place.

What were the character's names again? For the most part they looked and acted the same, and the ones who did stand out, were killed off eventually. Granted, it was only four episodes,...and it was probably difficult to produce good content, and also the time and budget they had were probably low. But - that doesn't mean they could've at least tried to make a decent, consistent storyline that most viewers could comprehend. Yet again, the gore was great, although I hate it when I see girls get hurt or abused, especially someone really young like Yuka. Nevertheless it was okay, if there were more episodes I would watch them and hopefully they'll be better and add to the storyline, and perhaps I'll like it more. and it was probably difficult to produce good content, and also the time and budget they had were probably low.

Yet again, the gore was great, although I hate it when I see girls get hurt or abused, especially someone really young like Yuka. Nevertheless it was okay, if there were more episodes I would watch them and hopefully they'll be better and add to the storyline, and perhaps I'll like it more."", ""I want to give this show some slack for being only a 4-episode OVA but then I think about some OVAs that I have seen that were stellar so that's out.There isn't a lot of horror anime out there so it's good to see someone actually tackling it. However, I'm not sure the execution of this came off too well. I've never played the game either, so this is going purely off the show.The show's plot was pretty straight-forward -- a group of school kids get sucked into a haunted school to face the ghosts of a whole group of murdered children and are faced...with crazy horrible situations, resulting in them having to find out the real mystery behind the murders in order to qualm the spirits and get back to their world.I found it mostly entertaining but I couldn't help but feel that most of the time, the show just stuck gore in there for the sake of it. It felt really manufactured and almost out of place. They took every opportunity to just feel that they were trying to be edgy and I felt that it distracted from any real scariness or spookiness that they had a good opportunity with the plot to play off of.The character's reactions to the world were perhaps the most annoying part of the show. Every reaction to every situation seemed completely unnatural and bizarre. Half the time, they seemed to be completely unaffected by the fact that they were hurled into this crazy netherworld and half the time, their reactions were completely over the top, followed by another dead-pan reaction. It was really strange.All-in-all, I found it pretty entertaining for 4 episodes but I am convinced that I wouldn't be able to handle more than that if it had dragged for even 10 episodes. with crazy horrible situations, resulting in them having to find out the real mystery behind the murders in order to qualm the spirits and get back to their world.I found it mostly entertaining but I couldn't help but feel that most of the time, the show just stuck gore in there for the sake of it.

But for all the wrong reasons. I realise it was a game beforehand, and honestly, without the story (perfect for a game but leaving nothing to desire for an anime), the art, sound and situation shine brightly.Maybe the downfall of this misused gem was the length - fitting that much story, characters and mystery into such a small time frame prevented Corpse Party from...developing and defining it's characters (could barely tell them apart, albeit their creative hairstyles), slowly unfurling the mystery, balancing the gore with the emotional trauma the characters naturally would have suffered, and presenting engaging themes.Perhaps its downfall was the number of characters - sure, you need plenty to kill off, a party isn't a party without corpses, but could the filler characters have been vaguer?Those that died simple and quick demanded the same background and influence as those who survive til the end - completely illogical. That time could have been spent rounding out the characters we would continue to see - the fact that we didn't know them that well lessened any effect death/misfortune would have on them - I found myself quite apathetic to the majority of the characters.The mix of the humour didn't quite do it for me. The purpose was probably to portray a high contrast between their life/psychology, and what they were to endure/become, but it reeally could have been done better - all bells and sparkles vs. all intestines and blood is too sharp a contrast to promote cohesion.Some positives, the art was mind-blowing. So cartoon-realistic that it made me want to puke, and i've survived some pretty gross anime. I would say that, for gore, this is the best of it's kind. We get really realistic deaths and injuries, with a consistent amount of blood, authentic results of weapons such as insides falling out, organs abandoning ship, decay swooping in. Good save art department. You done good.Of course nothing is so cringe worthy without sound. The squelch of grossness is what makes you want to cover your orifices, the removal of an eye can be determined with your eyes closed, the voice acting - especially scream/reaction to pain and fear are fantastic, adding sympathy where the story could not.I don't know, I think others may disagree.In raw form, definitely a winning series. The execution is lacking, and the detriments I mentioned really held it back from being an extreme success of an already popular franchise. It has none of the first person emotional power of the game, and maybe with this the rush would not hurt its integrity so sharply. I really did enjoy it, and I think lovers of the game will find a special affinity with it. developing and defining it's characters (could barely tell them apart, albeit their creative hairstyles), slowly unfurling the mystery, balancing the gore with the emotional trauma the characters naturally would have suffered, and presenting engaging themes.Perhaps its downfall was the number of characters - sure, you need plenty to kill off, a party isn't a party without corpses, but could the filler characters have been vaguer?Those that died simple and quick demanded the same background and influence as those who survive til the end - completely illogical.

It\'s extremely graphic, gory, and by far the most violent I\'ve ever seen in anime and my life. There\'s not that much emphasis on character development, the emphasis is put most immensely on the gore, horror, and sadistic ghost murderer plot. And when I say bloody, I damn well mean bloody - tongues are cut off, heads are severed, organs spill out of a bloody corpse, eyeballs are ripped out by a pair of scissors - I suggest not watching this at night. And please, if you\'re sensitive...to killing and blood, I strongly urge you to NOT watch this show for your own well-being.The story follows six students and their teacher stuck inside Heavenly Host Elementary School for the night, and for fun, they tell each other ghost stories surrounding the school. They also play a ""Bloody Mary"" like game to summon a spirit, for fun, until they realized they\'ve actually opened up the school\'s ancient curse surrounding a sadistic murderer that mysteriously tortured and killed the schoolchildren, whose spirits are cursed to haunt the hallways and get rid of ""intruders"".

I really thought I was desensitized to animated gore until this.The voice acting is ok, except for the expected screechy...moe voice acting for the little sister.

I remember playing the game on my PSP when it was released in America not too long ago. By far one of the most entertaining survival horror games I\'ve played in some time. Then, upon browsing through anime to watch, I noticed that there had been a 4 episode adaptation called ""Corpse Party: Tortured Souls"". Looking back, I really wish I could tell myself what I was about to get myself into, and maybe I could have saved my eyes from bleeding, but let\'s face it, I probably...would have watched it anyways.Corpse Party: Tortured Souls starts off in an almost identical way to the game. A bunch of students and their teacher are throwing a party for a student who\'s transferring away, but then have the floor beneath them collapse and they fall into another dimension. They wake up in a school that was supposedly demolished years ago after a bunch of murders that occurred. As they start searching for each other, they find out that they aren\'t the only ones in the school. And one by one, they are each hunted down. Seeing as it\'s only a 4 episode series, it seemed a bit rushed. It had an interesting premise, but it ended too soon, and it started drifting away from the story in the game, as well as giving us an ending that didn\'t exactly satisfy me to the fullest. However, for an adaptation, it did fairly well compared to others based on games.Oh boy, how should I say this... I think the thing that drew me to this anime the most was the artwork. Playing the game, you\'ll notice that there will be only a few detailed scenes, similar to a visual novel, meaning that the game didn\'t go overboard on the disturbing content and imagery. Now, for the anime however, they didn\'t hold back. In a way, the artwork reminded me of the anime ""Another"". It was detailed, disturbing, and somewhat bloodier than anything I\'ve ever seen. We had eyes being stabbed, tongues being cut off, guts spilling out, the whole package. Now, some people might not be able to handle this and it might make them turn away from this anime, and I can understand why, but this was what made Corpse Party: Tortured Souls so entertaining.Now we have the sound effects and voices. Every bone crunching, blood spurting, floor creaking, body breaking, brutal stabbing sound effect in this anime was top notch, and it had me cringing just thinking about it. As for the voice actors, I noticed a lot of people that I\'ve seen in some of my favorite anime. They had a pretty good cast for such a short series, but it was interesting to see Tetsuya Kakihara go from badass wizard to psychotic killer.The characters... hmm... what I can tell you right now is that they were all interesting to learn about and watch in action. One piece of advice though, just don\'t get too attached to them. For example [THE REST OF THIS SECTION HAS BEEN CUT OUT DUE TO SPOILERS] and then she took the scissors and [OH WAIT, THERE\'S STILL MORE] and then he strapped her down to the table and [JESUS, ENOUGH MAN]. So yeah, that\'s why.Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is NOT for everyone, and it is sure as hell not for my sister. She\'s the one who told me she watched this, and her reaction was enough to make me warn you. If you\'re into watching a bunch of happy-go-lucky students go crazy, this is for you. If not, steer clear. This is my warning. Now, if you\'ll excuse me, my friend is moving away. Tonight\'s her last night here, so we\'re throwing her a party at school. would have watched it anyways.Corpse Party: Tortured Souls starts off in an almost identical way to the game.

I dont usually write reviews because i feel like my inability to choose the right words to describe my opinion will prevent me from doing an adequate job, but this anime was simply too amazing, and i felt the need.I would like to continue by saying that although many websites have marked this anime as ages 13 and up, this is NONSENSE.  This anime is not for everyone, as its is one of the most gruesome and gory anime i have ever seen(this puts Elfen Lied to shame xD).There are some people who would find...literally every scene after the first 15 minutes or so to be in some way disturbing(personally only 4 or 5 scenes bothered me at all).Finally i would like to note if you plan to watch this series you should probably first watch Corpse Party Missing Footage as it is a prequel.Now for the Review.Story 10/10: The story was very gripping.  It keeps you very absorbed in the events that are unfolding, and constantly has you asking yourself questions.  There were many moments where i literally found myself leaning forward slightly in my seat.Although it is rather fast paced so there is a lot of stuff that happens that you dont understand.  And if you dont pay attention during most conversations you will be even more in the dark than the writers intended as the story progresses.Art 8/10: The art was certainly not bad.  It was at the very least on average with bar that anime fans have set.  The characters design and movements were very smooth.  I had no complaints.Sound 9/10: The quality of the voice acting was perfectly acceptable, i had no complaints.  I personally didnt find there to be a character with an irritating voice like there sometimes is.  The BGM was very fitting.  it added a lot to the suspense and tension in some scenes, and added mystery and immersion to the story in other moments.Character 8/10: As always in the horror genre there are truly intense situations.  As always in truly intense situations, there are stupid people who will make these situations worse for them or others.  There were some characters i hated, some that i liked, and some that simply made me angry.This is where i lack the ability to fully put my opinion into words, but i can at least say that there is a large variety of characters, and each one definitely adds to the story and the feels you get from this series lol.Enjoyment 10/10: This series was truly outstanding.  It is a must see for anyone who likes the horror genre or can stand intense gore and gruesome scenes.  I loved every moment i spent watching this unfortunately short series.Even the moments that stirred emotion up in me or caused me to become sad were simply amazing to be a part of based on everything else.  And i usually let individual moments of a series that really shook me in some way affect my opinion greatly.Overall 10/10:  This anime was simply a masterpiece.  I had no real complaints  Personally i rate every section of this anime to be a 10/10, but thats only because of the sheer enjoyment i got from the series, so i still had to poke at the holes i found as much as i could.I loved this anime and will be recommending it to all of my friends.  This is one of the anime i will never forget, for both good and bad reasons.Hope this was helpful ^_^ literally every scene after the first 15 minutes or so to be in some way disturbing(personally only 4 or 5 scenes bothered me at all).Finally i would like to note if you plan to watch this series you should probably first watch Corpse Party Missing Footage as it is a prequel.Now for the Review.Story 10/10: The story was very gripping.

However, the horror/gore is top notch and the sound design is remarkably gruesome. If you wanna watch Another or Tokyo Ghoul but without the pesky story or those awful meaningful characters getting in the way of the spraying blood and guts, Corpse Party is your anime!]Corpse Party, the cult classic gore porn of anime. A B-grade slasher movie in anime form. When this one came out, I heard so much about it, so many people raving about it on the internet, either positive or negative, it was insane. I like myself...some horror any day, but since I gravitate towards more story-oriented anime, I skipped this one for quite a while. But we all know the thing about the cat and curiosity, and this time the cat is not only dead, but gutted and strangled with it\'s own entrails only to come back and haunt the bejeezus outta you until you gouge your own eyes out with a rusty spoon.There is really no reason to talk about story here. Corpse Party is an adaptation of an old survival-RPG game. There is something about a benign friendship vow going horribly wrong and sending a bunch of kids to the murder dimension full of angry ghosts and sharp objects. Tadaa, we have the perfect setting for a grandiose gore-fest. In-between the gurgling death-screams and the disemboweling of small children, there are bits about solving a mystery or lifting a curse or something, but frankly it\'s just a confusing mess. Let\'s face it, if you keep watching after the first episode, you are not here for the intellectual challenge anyway, so...The horror part is great. The entire anime is dreary and dark, with an ""eternal storm at twilight"" going on, just like Another, and it creates a perfectly miserable atmosphere for the series. The characters are dumb as bricks, committing the entire repertoire of ""what NOT to do in a slasher movie"" tropes. Splitting up, let\'s go check out that noise, trusting the murderous spirits of the nightmare world, kids going insane and turning on each other, etc. It\'s kind of endearing in a way. They are not entirely oblivious, which is a nice thing, but most of what they do is just adding more fuel for the pyre.Corpse Party is not a slow-burner, the bodies start dropping almost immediately and they don\'t stop till the end. The gore/slasher part is the main course, the sole reason why anyone would watch this thing. The art style and animation is top notch. The look of sheer, bone chilling dread, the realization that you ARE dying, and utter insanity on the faces is priceless. The murders are sufficiently ghastly, the screaming is horrifying and the variety and intensity of the gore scenes sometimes borders on ridiculous. It\'s all kept pretty real as well, the gore is not goofy or cringey, some of the scenes sent chills down even my spine, and I\'m a seasoned horror veteran. What can I say, I\'m not really used to watching kids brutalize each other in sickeningly graphic detail, even in animated form. The sounds and the VO add to the experience incredibly well. The sound of tearing flesh, screeches of agony, splattering of gore and people choking on their own blood is not something you hear every day. Definitely A+ for this series.Corpse Party is definitely not for the squeamish or the faint of heart. If you dislike blood or children being murdered in graphic detail, maybe steer clear of this one. However, if you are a connoisseur of entertainment of the dark kind, this little OVA is a gem you shouldn\'t miss. some horror any day, but since I gravitate towards more story-oriented anime, I skipped this one for quite a while.

The characters are dumb as bricks, committing the entire repertoire of ""what NOT to do in a slasher movie"" tropes. Splitting up, let\'s go check out that noise, trusting the murderous spirits of the nightmare world, kids going insane and turning on each other, etc. It\'s kind of endearing in a way. They are not entirely oblivious, which is a nice thing, but most of what they do is just adding more fuel for the pyre.Corpse Party is not a slow-burner, the bodies start dropping almost immediately and they don\'t stop till the end. The gore/slasher part is the main course, the sole reason why anyone would watch this thing. The art style and animation is top notch. The look of sheer, bone chilling dread, the realization that you ARE dying, and utter insanity on the faces is priceless. The murders are sufficiently ghastly, the screaming is horrifying and the variety and intensity of the gore scenes sometimes borders on ridiculous. It\'s all kept pretty real as well, the gore is not goofy or cringey, some of the scenes sent chills down even my spine, and I\'m a seasoned horror veteran. What can I say, I\'m not really used to watching kids brutalize each other in sickeningly graphic detail, even in animated form. The sounds and the VO add to the experience incredibly well. The sound of tearing flesh, screeches of agony, splattering of gore and people choking on their own blood is not something you hear every day. Definitely A+ for this series.Corpse Party is definitely not for the squeamish or the faint of heart. If you dislike blood or children being murdered in graphic detail, maybe steer clear of this one. However, if you are a connoisseur of entertainment of the dark kind, this little OVA is a gem you shouldn\'t miss.', 'I had never heard of this anime before, so hearing about it so close to Halloween, I figured I\'d give it a try because as much as I hate horror movies/shows, I love watching them. I\'d read good things about Corpse Party so I thought I\'d give it a try. Sadly, instead of enjoying it like I had hoped to, I spent more time mad or frustrated than I did having a good time.Story (7): The story was a safe horror tale. High schoolers hear horror story, then basically live it. Nothing too unique. I feel like it could have been done a bit better...but for the short amount of episodes it had, the job was done.Art (6): Again, nothing really special about it. I do think they did a good job with the ""dead faces"". It really showed the last emotions going through the characters mind at the time of death. The gore was visually appealing as well.Sound (5): When I first started watching, the sound didn\'t stand out too much, but it did add a bit to the cringey atmosphere of things. But that pleasure turned to frustration really fast. It seemed like the sounds were too overdone. Too...exaggerated. Basically all the gore sounds just sounded like a constant mix of velcro and fluids being sprayed. By the end of the first episode it felt overplayed. It was more of a nuisance that brought me out of the story, even though it wasn\'t very in depth to begin with.Character (4): I understand with it being such a short series there isn\'t time to develop characters. But they could have at least given them some brains. I\'ve seen a good amount of horror films yet I\'ve never seen characters so blatantly dumb. This is where most of my frustration came from. For example, if someone is pulling a guns trigger at you, your first instinct shouldn\'t be to close your eyes and cover your face hoping that will help. that\'s the kind of mentality it seemed most of the characters had in this show. Even being under an extremely stressful/terrifying circumstance, no one would think that\'s a decision that will help.Enjoyment (5): As stated above, Most of my time watching this was spent annoyed at how stupid the characters were and frustrated with the sounds. However, there were some parts that made me enjoy it, although they didn\'t really ""save"" the anime for me. The visual quality for the gory bits were well done and the story was pretty entertaining. Those kept me from shutting it off so I\'m glad I didn\'t.Overall (5): If you\'re looking for a fairly cliche horror story with some enjoyable gore and don\'t feel like investing time into the characters, you\'ll probably enjoy it. It wasn\'t the worst thing I\'ve ever seen, but I certainly don\'t think it was good. There were, however, some redeemable qualities that make the negatives worth fighting through. but for the short amount of episodes it had, the job was done.Art (6): Again, nothing really special about it.

This shall be short and to the point so let us begin, I am a huge fan of the Corpse Party franchise and can not wait for the soon to be released Ps Vita game as well as an English patch for the Pc one.That being said, this anime follows Corpse Party: Blood Covered (PSP) very well, even with some major changes, so I highly recommend not spoiling the game for yourself and go play it before watching Tortured Souls.You can thank me later...because alot, if not most, of the story is beautifully animated within these four gruesomely awesome episodes. Definitely not for the faint of heart but highly recommended for any fans of the series as well as horror.So in other words, play Corpse Party: Blood Covered first for the PSP and after falling in love with this masterpiece continue on to the second game (Book Of Shadows). All you really need is to play the first chapter though of the second one before watching Tortured Souls.But trust me on this one, the experience is going to differ depending on if you actually beat the first game. You will have more of a bond with each character knowing their story, at least I know I did. Play the games then watch this anime, you won't regret it. because alot, if not most, of the story is beautifully animated within these four gruesomely awesome episodes.

Just for curiosity, decided to watch the anime version, and.... it's bad.Everything's so rushed, and poorly told, despite the pacing itself being decent, that I didn't care even a bit for the characters at their gruesome deaths.This is really bloody, like everyone here has already said, and the game is not really that different, but there, the atmosphere is built more properly, and every death may not be so graphical, but feels even nastier.Plus, there are different endings, and some events that are...in the game, are not in the anime, so it feels incomplete and full of holes.My best hint: either play the game, or watch some walthrough. Have fun. in the game, are not in the anime, so it feels incomplete and full of holes.My best hint: either play the game, or watch some walthrough. Have fun."", ""First of all, I am not a PRO review writer, and this is also my first review, but I just had to share my thoughts about this anime.Since it's a horror anime, and it's supposed to give you the creeps, and that's probably the reason you want to watch it, you wonder about how disturbing it is. Actually, it does involve some scary stuff, but it didn't quite reach the level a 'pure' horror anime should. There are other anime you'll find more disturbing (Tokyo Ghoul is one of them).For a horror anime, the story is kind-of standard and doesn't really stand out with anything...but it would be good enough to get a 7, maybe slightly more ... IF and only IF they would cut the last 30 seconds. For real, when you reach that point just stop and imagine the ending yourself. It basically ruins everything with a WTF moment, and those moments are not what you look forward to in a horror. It's not that it's disturbing, it's just that you don't have enough build-up for the characters to actually care, and a moment that is supposed to be sad becomes laughable, and the last thing you want from a horror is comedy. Let's be real. Horror movies are supposed to give you the creeps. It's one of those moments that are so bad that they're actually funny. And it wouldn't be so bad if it would be somewhere in the middle of the story. But it's the ending, and from my experience with anime, the premise and the ending are the most memorable. Now I gotta live with that. That alone makes the story worth a 4.There is not much to talk about the art. It's standard for 2013, but the music felt a bit more than that. It clearly enchanted the spookiness of the story, but none of the tracks were good enough to make me want to listen to them alone.Personally, I found the characters to be quite stupid. Come on ! You clearly shouldn't pull on a hanging person ... :\\Other than that, the characters are quite numerous and pretty useless from my perspective, but I don't wanna go into 'why' 'cause that's spoiler territory.Memorable characters are only two (and those create the WTF moment at the end. Duh ... Could've been a lot better. )Over all, I enjoyed the anime up until it hit the last 30 seconds. It just fell into a never-ending pit.And since the 'art', 'sound' and 'characters' are there just to decide the enjoyment value and to amplify the story, I won't count them in the final evaluation, because I already counted them in the other 2. And with a little bit of maths, (4 + 4) / 2 = 4 final score.If the ending would've been cut or different: (8 + 8) / 2 = 8Have a nice day, or night, wherever you live.And for your sake ... Don't watch 'till the end ... Stop when you reach 26:35 in episode 4. On top of the fact that it's a comedy WTF moment in a horror anime, it actually makes no sense, so take my word for it and don't watch it. Please. but it would be good enough to get a 7, maybe slightly more ... IF and only IF they would cut the last 30 seconds.

Please."", 'Rush rush rush rush rush rush rush rush rush rush rush rush rush...Before we start I want you to acknowledge the following:1)I like to break my reviews down into sections, rate and then follow-up with al ot of text explaining my reasoning begind it.2)I am writing from a perspective of someone who knows the gmae this anime was based on very very well. I know the entire plot of the game, I know all side-qiest stuff you can do and I know all the endings.3)I hate spoilers, I absolutely hate spoilers but in this case I\'m afraid I cannot go without spoilers in order to...express myself.I cannot stress this enough - this is definetly NOT a good adaptation of the game. The main motif of the adaptation is - RUSH. But let\'s start at the beginning.I accidentaly stumbled upon this anime and before I watched it I knew it was based on a game. I don\'t usually do this but this time I felt I\'ll pay my attention to the game before I shift it to the anime. And this was a blessing.The game is SO MUCH better than the anime. But then what do you expect when you have a story that can only be told in 5 hours and someone shortens it to 2...Truth be told I was hoping this anime would be a good adaptation of an awesome game. But I was dissapointed. To show you this I will make a little breakdown here:Story - 9Art- 8Sound - 8Character - 8Enjotment - 5Weird huh? Well, the story and characters are based on the game obviously hence the high scores but the enjoeyment from the anime is pretty low because I felt so BETRAYED watching this.There is not enough time to build the connectionts between characters and every litle arc is just slightly touched upon leaving an unpleasant feeling.You are basicaly bombarded with images and plot developments that simply make absolutely no sense because they are rushed beyond sense.In the game you had an incredible and somewhat slow build up to what was to happen and it felt amazing - you felt violated by how it was shown. There is this aura of mystery, horror and shock. I felt shocked at some scenes in the game. What do we get in the anime instead? Scenes that are just spewed at you one after another making no sense whatsoever. And gore. Yeah, sensless gore. There were some gory scenes in the game too but all in good taste (if you can talk about ""taste"" in gore scenes *yuck*). But in the anime it\'s just gore - gore after gore hoping to shock you. Well news flash - if you only give us disgusting images we\'re gonna get disgusted obviously duh...In the game it was handled so much better, one of the reasons is there were many endings.But even here - if you adapt a game with multiple endings, PLEASE adapt the true ending. Why? Well the ""true"" ending is the one that teh creators of the game give the most attention to, most developement time and thought. Everything else is just... side-quests. And they went with said side-quests in teh anime. Even worse, they twisted them for their use. And with all the confusion steming from rushing every scene it creates a really unpleasant feel.A ""SHOCK"" SCENE IS NOT EFFECTIVE IF IT HAS NO BUILD-UP TO BACK IT!If you barely know the character, if you only saw him/her for 20 seconds you cannot feel connected to him/her. This is why it is necesary to give them some backtory at least. And while we\'re at it - all the flashbacks with backtstory of the characters that gave a lot of insight on them in the game guess what... not in the anime... Like at all. We don\'t know what the relations between the characters are yet we are expected to care for them - I call bullshit on that one.Phew, I kinda went on a rant here, and my high ratings for the story and characters are almost excluseviley steming from my enjoyment of the game.!!!!!!!URGENT!!!!!!!So if I can give you any advice - don\'t watch the anime, play the game instead. And if you don\'t feel like playing/can\'t afford it/whatever, just watch/read a let\'s play. Believe me, you will have a lot better time than with this anime. A person that has no knowledge of the game and watches the anime will be so confused and so pissed of that it\'s not even worth it. And the story really deserves praise.So to finish it up - Game>Anime express myself.I cannot stress this enough - this is definetly NOT a good adaptation of the game.

Me, being the horror and gore fanatic I am, loved this anime to bits.Story // 7While I would love to give the story a higher rating, it pales in contrast to the original story. Well, stories. After all, this is an OVA series based off the Corpse Party games. From start to finish, I think the story was a little better than average. It kept me in my seat, (bed), and I watched all of it in a single day. If you\'re...looking for a better than average story, this is the way to go.Art // 7Me, being the impatient person I am, was too lazy to dig through the vast Internet to find a high quality version of Corpse Party. So, I watched the series on DailyMotion and the quality was... 360 pixels. This may or may not affect the art score. I, personally, thought the art style fit the show nicely. It set the ""creepy"" mood and it kept the art style consistently.Sound // 10I LOVED the sound on this anime. It was one of the most memorable things about it for me, other than the gore. The bone-chilling screams, the background music, the opening, just all of it, fit the series like a glove. The sound effects really helped me adore the series to its full potential.Character // 8The only reason I didn\'t give character a higher rating was because the anime didn\'t have quite enough episodes to really describe each of the characters. After all, there were only four, and they had to kill off pretty much every character by the end of the series. Still, I think the characters were decently constructed and their stories were told decently.Enjoyment // 10I enjoyed this anime as much as I possibly could. It had everything I adored in it after all. Suspense, gore effect, horror, and the teeniest splash of romance. Suuuuuper glad Corpse Party didn\'t have extravagant ecchi. It would have ruined the mood.Overall // 9All in all, this anime was fantastic. The story, sound, art, characters, they all pulled you in. After I watched this, I was forced to look behind me every now and then, a little paranoid after the creep factor this anime gave me. looking for a better than average story, this is the way to go.Art // 7Me, being the impatient person I am, was too lazy to dig through the vast Internet to find a high quality version of Corpse Party.

At first I was hesitant because as an 8 year old I watched play throughs of the visual novel(s) a lot, and they genuinely scared me at some parts, but nonetheless I still wanted to play the visual novel(s). Once I clicked the first episode the sounds immediately scared me, and i was sure I was in for...a ride. But, I was only a few minutes into the first episode and I was already getting bored. Personally, I believe the anime started getting better around the last few minutes of the 2nd episode. But as I continued to watch the anime, my feelings were beginning to get mixed. I started to like it more by the minute, until the last few minutes of the last episode ruined my enjoyment.Now, onto explaining why I rated everything as I did.Story - 7/10, or GoodPersonally I was very excited for the story because I always heard people saying it’s one of the greatest horrors of all time, and I just can’t agree. I’m not sure if I’m putting this in the right category, but I thought the gore and deaths were overdone for the amount of episodes there were, and I thought everything was done WAY better in what I’ve seen of the visual novel. I did like the story, but I felt it could’ve been much better if things weren’t overdone, and if they would’ve changed some deaths and some of the gore so that more characters could get development. Most of the time, I either laughed or just stared at the screen during the deaths. I really liked the kind of story it had, it’s overall pretty unique aside from what I thought was wrong with it. I believe if the anime had more episodes it would’ve been much better, but we’ll most likely never know. But overall, I thought it had a good story.Art - 8/10, or Very GoodThe art was actually pretty good. I didn’t notice any annoying scenes in terms of art or animation, but there was some small stuff that bothered me. Well for starters, the guts and blood didn’t feel extremely real. To me they just looked like 2D drawings, and I personally don’t understand how it can be considered gorey when the gore wasn’t drawn that well. Like for example, I really preferred the way the “gore” was drawn in Another. I also thought some of the scenes were drawn weirdly, but I’m not going to say which ones, as that would be a spoiler. Personally I really loved the art in a lot of scenes, but my favorite might actually be considered a spoiler so I’d rather not say anything about it.Sound - 7/10, or GoodI liked the sounds, although some of them were just annoying. The OST was pretty good, and I especially like the opening song. I personally disliked the sound because of really any scene involving the girls in the series, such as the one scene were they all say, “Kawaii” in unison. I also really disliked any scene where the characters screamed, as it was extremely unnecessary. There were also some more minor reasons why I disliked the sound, but they’re not extremely important and I personally believe they don’t change much.Characters - 6/10, or FairPersonally, I had a LOT of characters that I simply did not like. Honestly the only ones I liked were most of the guys, other than Yoshiki, I also genuinely disliked Satoshi until the last episode. And the girls in the anime annoyed me a LOT, especially Seiko, Mayu, and Yuka. The only girl I liked was the teacher but yeah... My favorite characters were probably Morishige and Kizami, and I really wish they got more development. Well, I overall thought mostly all of the characters needed character development, but I still thought some of the characters were cool.Enjoyment - 5/10, or MediocreI only enjoyed around half of the anime, and some of the parts that I enjoyed unfortunately seemed very rushed and I wish they could’ve lasted longer. I liked the unique story, but a lot of things seemed out of place, such as the times of the deaths and stuff. Overall I’d say I half enjoyed the anime and half didn’t, and the reasons why are basically laid out in the rest of my review.Overall - 6.6 = 7/10, or GoodOverall, I believed it was a good anime. The story was very unique and there were some good characters, and the OST was great. If there’s ever a remake, I hope it gets more episodes so that everyone can be more developed, and if they ever remake it I also hope the art and sounds are improved! But of course, I doubt it’ll ever be remade so for now I’ll continue to believe what I do. And if you like horror, I say you should give Corpse Party a chance! While it may not be the best in terms of development or deaths, it’s still a good anime. a ride. But, I was only a few minutes into the first episode and I was already getting bored. Personally, I believe the anime started getting better around the last few minutes of the 2nd episode. But as I continued to watch the anime, my feelings were beginning to get mixed.

The OST was pretty good, and I especially like the opening song. I personally disliked the sound because of really any scene involving the girls in the series, such as the one scene were they all say, “Kawaii” in unison. I also really disliked any scene where the characters screamed, as it was extremely unnecessary. There were also some more minor reasons why I disliked the sound, but they’re not extremely important and I personally believe they don’t change much.Characters - 6/10, or FairPersonally, I had a LOT of characters that I simply did not like. Honestly the only ones I liked were most of the guys, other than Yoshiki, I also genuinely disliked Satoshi until the last episode. And the girls in the anime annoyed me a LOT, especially Seiko, Mayu, and Yuka. The only girl I liked was the teacher but yeah... My favorite characters were probably Morishige and Kizami, and I really wish they got more development. Well, I overall thought mostly all of the characters needed character development, but I still thought some of the characters were cool.Enjoyment - 5/10, or MediocreI only enjoyed around half of the anime, and some of the parts that I enjoyed unfortunately seemed very rushed and I wish they could’ve lasted longer. I liked the unique story, but a lot of things seemed out of place, such as the times of the deaths and stuff. Overall I’d say I half enjoyed the anime and half didn’t, and the reasons why are basically laid out in the rest of my review.Overall - 6.6 = 7/10, or GoodOverall, I believed it was a good anime. The story was very unique and there were some good characters, and the OST was great. If there’s ever a remake, I hope it gets more episodes so that everyone can be more developed, and if they ever remake it I also hope the art and sounds are improved! But of course, I doubt it’ll ever be remade so for now I’ll continue to believe what I do. And if you like horror, I say you should give Corpse Party a chance! While it may not be the best in terms of development or deaths, it’s still a good anime.', ""The biggest flaw for this anime were the characters. They were really annoying and pretty idiotic-- there were only two characters out of the nine main ones that I had no problems with.As far as the horror factor goes, there was nothing that made me jump out of my seat, but it certainly had that creep factor to it. I couldn't sleep the night I watched it.And as you'd expect from the title CORPSE Party, it's extremely gory and bloody. From innards spilling out to eyes being stabbed and torn out, if you can't handle even a little blood you really shouldn't watch this....It's very graphic, it doesn't seem like they even tried to censor anything.Time-wise, I started and finished it within a couple of hours. It goes very quickly. At the beginning, in episode one, I must say that I really wasn't a fan. Mostly because of the idiotic fanservice, I don't feel like it belongs in such a grim show. But it definitely grew on me, mostly because of the mystery to it. It was that mystery that kept me watching, otherwise I would've probably dropped it. The resolution to that mystery was very emotional, and I'm not going to lie when I say that I was very close to crying.Overall, you can't blame such a short series for little characterization or a rushed story. For only four episodes it was very good and especially so for binge watching.

The sounds were great and made the deaths more creepy if you removed the sounds from it, it would just make it really strange and just plain stupidThe characters were good but I feel like I needed more backstory from them, It was sad seeing some characters die but I feel if I knew more about the characters...I would have been a little bit more sad for the people who were getting killed off but I felt more sad for their friends. You see how innocent all of the characters were at the start and by the end of it most of they're friends were killed right in front of them and to me that is what really makes corpse party scary.The artwork is really good, The school was really creepy, it showed how old and abandoned the school was. The artwork for the deaths were pretty good, I didn't really find the deaths gruesome because I watch a lot of gruesome anime but they were still pretty horrible.Overall I did like this anime but not as much as I thought I would.

It was entertaining to watch I must say. The music was amazing - I loved the theme song - and the art style of the show was incredible. Some of the jump scares of the ghosts were so well done that I actually jumped out of my seat.

Continue with caution if you haven\'t seen the anime or played/watched an LP of the game!Okay, so, this is an anime based off a horror game of the same name. I\'m fresh off a playthrough of said game, so some of what I say may be complaints about it as an adaption. Which...There\'s plenty of things for me to complain about, but that\'ll come in due time.Story: 3/10This is not a good representation of the game\'s story. They tried to cram a ton of information into roughly an hour and a half or two hours, and they...did so in a very poor way. When there isn\'t mindless and pointless killing, there\'s huge and confusing exposition dumps and poor attempts at building character. There was even a number of plot points either completely taken out or retconned to make their given amount of episodes, such as the revelation that Kizami isn\'t the ally Yuka thought he was. If I remember right, I don\'t think he ever encountered Morishige in the game.Art: 4/10It was...okay, I guess? I mean, anatomy for the most part was fine and they emulated the game\'s art style decently enough, but the girl\'s faces all felt like they had \'same face syndrome\'. Plus, did we really have to have an increase in the panty shots? They got to be pretty irritating the more they happened, especially once the ""camera"" was set right behind one of the female student\'s ass. Aside from that, it was too dark to see a lot of the scenery and at times, the choppy way it was cut can make everything a little hard to follow. Otherwise, it\'s the generic ""anime desu~!"" style, so not much sticks out.Sound: 6/10Probably the best part of the anime. The voice actors certainly sounded like they were trying to breathe some life into the characters, the music and sound effects certainly added to the horror and tension as well. The OP song was good too, though I did skip it after episode one to save myself a bit of time.Character: 1/10Normally, I get attached to characters pretty quickly. However, if I didn\'t go through the game before watching this anime, I would have absolutely no reason to care about these characters what so ever. They\'ve got next to know personality, and we get next to no information on who they are and what their struggles are. Not to mention, with the retconning or entire removal of some instances of the game, the characterization suffers even further.Let\'s go back to the Kizami example. He doesn\'t show himself as a killer to us, the viewer/player, until he stabs his friend and kicks him down to the floor below and doesn\'t reveal so to Yuka until after she finds that friend barely alive. You spend a portion of the game with him interacting with Yuka, helping her, and even play as him to get past some fallen cabinets. In the anime...his true personality is revealed maybe a minute after Yuka is found by him while hiding from a maddened Morishige.I know this is the fault of adaptations, but to me, this is the worst part of the anime. Not even Sachiko felt nearly as interesting as she was in the game.Enjoyment: 1/10This is not something I enjoyed, which is a shame, because I genuinely thought it\'d be at least decent. This will be one of the few anime I\'m flat-out dropping in the middle of watching, because I\'m bored out of my mind and nothing seems to be improving as the episodes go on.Overall: 2/10I don\'t normally end up picky about the anime I see, but this was just a mess. About as much a mess as the school everyone winds up trapped in. The calm moments were bland and uninteresting, the gorey parts felt unnecessary, and the characters have not left much of an impact on me in over half the episodes available. It\'s really not worth anyone\'s time, unless all you want to see is all the blood and guts for whatever reason.If you want an actual interesting story, though, I\'d suggest playing the game and experiencing it for yourself.

On the argument all good, a group of students who do a ritual of ""friendship"" that ends up leading them to live a nightmare where who knows if they can leave alive from it.Graphic is okay, the scenes where the characters die do not show at all (as I would have really wanted) but the gloomy and lugubrious environment of the Heavenly Host academy is well designed conveying suspense.The Soundtrack could be better, as well as the background noises that really are imperceptible during the story.The characters did not like me very much, they...just went as pigs to the slaughterhouse with the sole aim of trying to show scenes of horror that are very forced and somewhat predictable. Also some of them lack common sense (like Satoshi to send his little sister to walk with a ghost being tortured later, he who fucking in his right mind would do something like that?).It seems to me that it would have taken more than 4 OVAS to explain the story better and that the characters had better time to complement each other.Even so I do not think it is a bad adaptation, if you are looking for an average Horror anime this is a good option, but do not be fooled with the objective of finding special in terms of deaths or cruelty because there are some other animes that show much better.Total: 6.5 just went as pigs to the slaughterhouse with the sole aim of trying to show scenes of horror that are very forced and somewhat predictable.

a truth, the story isn\'t that bad actually it will make you want to know more but if you\'re not a fan of horror stories, I guess it won\'t be this good to you then.I\'m not a horror crazy fan myself but the story kept catching my attention, never thought I\'ll watch the anime to be honest....What wasn\'t this ""good"" to me is that it doesn\'t give you achance to catch up with the story so you\'ll need to focus in order to understand one scene, of course some people will find that amazing and like it but oh well at the end it\'s just my opinion.I Recommend it to horror fans that want a good horror story :) What wasn\'t this ""good"" to me is that it doesn\'t give you achance to catch up with the story so you\'ll need to focus in order to understand one scene, of course some people will find that amazing and like it but oh well at the end it\'s just my opinion.I Recommend it to horror fans that want a good horror story :)', ""Warning possible SpoilersI've seen a good amount of horror anime's, but none not even Another, Elfen Lied or When They Cry have made me as mortified as much as Corpse Party did because this is definitely a true example of a gorey horror anime.The story is about a group of friends who performed a good luck ritual for a friend who was leaving them, but the ritual opened an alternate dimension and trapped the students there, surrounded by haunted spirits the student had to fend for their lives to survive.Let me start by saying this show is fu*ked up I'm not kidding you will...be having nightmares after watching this because this much like the usual horror films of the 1980's like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street where a group of teenagers try to survive against a supernatural being where only 1 or 2 survive and that is pretty much what happens here.Despite being only 4 episodes they are really suspenseful episodes because seeing the characters trying to survive against haunted ghosts was terrifying considering they weren't the only people there either and the fact that some of these characters went insane and turned on each other just made the situation even more hectic.Amongst all the screaming and dying there is actually some mystery here since the students are teleported to a former elementary school it was interesting seeing the characters trying to connect the dots and helping the spirits of the kids that were killed move on even if the spirits did try to kill them in the process, but the part that annoys me the most about the story is the way it ended and considering there was a game made of this it is kinda surprising how it ended as most of the characters died including one of the MC's who died in a pretty crappy way, but other than the ending the story was definitely a roller coaster of thrilling suspense.Now there are nine students including a teacher and an MC's younger sister and let me tell ya these characters were definitely not ready for something like this.Satoshi Mochida and Naomi Nakashima are the primary MC's who pretty much solve the mystery, but also go through the most crap to be honest, Satoshi is a pretty cool guy who has a kind-hearted nature and doesn't hesitate to help and protect his friends while Naomi is a little different while being bright and cheerful she can be stubborn and sometimes lets her emotions control her actions which in a situation like this isn't going to help.Ayumi Shinozaki is the person who suggested the ritual in the first place, she is surprisingly a tough girl and does pretty well in the whole situation as she even figures out how to make the haunted spirits move on although despite her brave and protective nature there are times where she does make selfish acts.Yoshiki Kishinuma is another male character who is pretty much the delinquent of the group and doesn't really care much about the others except Ayumi who he has a crush on and there are a lot times where he is selfish often thinking about himself and not the others, but he does pull through in the end as he sacrificed his life to save his friends.Yuka Mochida is Satoshi's younger sister and despite being a teen she does act in a younger manner mainly because she is pampered by her parents which makes her the most vulnerable character of the group and often relies on the others to help her survive which led to her downfall.Seiko, Mayu, Sakutaro and Yui are the other members of the group who all meet gruesome ends and even before they died they didn't do a whole lot to help the group as Seiko and Mayu died very quickly while Yui got knocked out for a while and then she died in a sudden way not long after reconnecting with everyone while Sakutaro went insane and tried to kill the others.The artstyle was done very well especially with the detailing of the elementary school which looked creepy as hell definitely not a place you'd want to be and the design of the ghostly spirits was also done well too as it definitely showed the creepiness of them.When it comes to being a horror this was gruesome and I mean gruesome because the way most of the characters die was horrible and Yuka's death was probably the most scarring because she got the slow and painful death which just made me feel so sorry for the poor girl while everyone else got a quicker death even if they too were pretty graphic and the ghostly spirits along with other people who were also trapped definitely to make the situation even more terrifying like the main spirit Sachiko along with Yuuya a student from a different school who is a creepy psychopath were people who would you nightmares because they did some really fu*ked up sh*t to the characters making them some of the most terrifying villains I've seen to date.Overall this was a really gruesome and suspenseful anime that shows true horror in a classic way so if you want to scare you're buddies or scar them for life then show them this they'll definitely thank you for it. be having nightmares after watching this

I played it and fell in love with it. it has one of the BEST stories i have ever seen. its horror is psychotic not cheap, its gore is mostly auditory not visual. I don't even like horror games yet i absolutely LOVE it.so what does the anime do? It takes this great story and throws it out the window. it takes the awesome psychotic horror and makes it cheap, and it takes the auditory gore and, not only does it fully change it to visual gore,...it decides that the best way to do this masterpiece of a game (in)justice is to change it so it becomes one very gory death scene after one very gory death scene from the beginning until the end. story? what is that?! psychotic horror?? what is that?!! greatness??? never heard of it!!!!It butchered the game and turned an amazing Mindf*** true horror story into a series of gruesome scenes one after another without anytime to build tension and fear with the only point being to kill everyone in the most gore filled way possible(which is, ironically, basically what all the haters think the game is about).Stay far far away from this. play the game instead. you will not be disappointed there and you will be very disappointed here. it decides that the best way to do this masterpiece of a game (in)justice is to change it so it becomes one very gory death scene after one very gory death scene from the beginning until the end. story? what is that?! psychotic horror?? what is that?!! greatness??? never heard of it!!!!It butchered the game and turned an amazing Mindf*** true horror story into a series of gruesome scenes one after another without anytime to build tension and fear with the only point being to kill everyone in the most gore filled way possible(which is, ironically, basically what all the haters think the game is about).Stay far far away from this. play the game instead. you will not be disappointed there and you will be very disappointed here."", 'Corpse Party: Tortured Souls - Bougyakusareta Tamashii no Jukyou was not the worst possible horror anime you could watch but it clearly was not the best either.To understand the following review, here are my state of mind when watching and my horror / survival experience : I always appreciated horror-survival video games, movies and recently anime. Indeed, my movie list collection contains a lot of classics (Friday 13th, George Romero\'s movies, The Exorcist, Texas Chain Saw Massacre, etc) or recent movies (REC serie, The Descent, Conjuring, Sinister, Mama, etc). Also, I have played a lot of horror / survival video games, such as the Resident...Evil Serie, Obscure I & II, Dead Island, Outlast and more. That means, I could be considered as someone who would not totally mess things up if placed in a comparable situation ; well I\'m saying these words behind my computer, it might be presomptuous but not totally wrong.So, when I watched Corpse Party, it became extremely irritating, frustrating or annoying to notice most characters had such an irrelevant & inadapted behaviour. For example, whenever you are lost with someone in an unknown place, human normal behaviour would be : staying close to the other person and exploring together. But... it was probably too much to ask here. Yeah indeed, all the characters responded present to the classic horror cliche, like wandering alone, trying to act as if nothing was scary (come on, you find yourself locked in a dark destroyed school, do you really need to apply cream on your butt ? ) and willing to save everyone, because you are heartful.As you could already understand, I did not like Corpse Party. Behind my screen, I had to restrain my insults or screams, because it became really tearing to see every character acting as if they never watched an horror movie. Especially this guy who lets his younger sister going to the toilets with a TOTALLY unknown weird girl... dude you got to face dead bodies, blood and guts AND you just leave your sister to a random person ? Talking about her, she finds herself trapped because she peed on herself and decided to leave her wet pant in a desk (for real).I surely look mean, hard or harsh criticizing these teenagers main characters. But the anime just managed to gather every big cliche you can meet in horror movies, which was quite annoying to watch at some point. However, it would be a lie to tell this anime sucked a lot. No, indeed, the global dark scary and rusty atmostphere was efficient : it inspired a place you never want to be locked in. Basically, no one wants to be in an old school by a rainy night, but especially not with crazy teenagers and murderous ghosts.Nevertheless, the major point of Corpse Party remains the very (not to say extremely) high level of violence and gore. Usually, an horror movie catches your feeling easier than anime, considering it shows you real humans being slaughtered, tortured, murdered. But it did not matter for this anime, I don\'t think anyone stood still while watching a very young girl being tortured, having her eye extracted from her head and stabbed with a knife... Yeah, you got it right : this anime is famous because of how horrificly bloody it can be.It also has an OK scenario, boarding a conclusion. You can easily notice that the whole show has a video game rythm, including a sort of ""hints research"" that leads to something classic in any horror work : a revengeance perpetuated by a murdered ghost who came back to haunt other people. As expected the denouement takes place when the entity finds peace : classic but not necessarily bad.Well, my own conclusion is easy : if you appreciate gore, blood, guts and torture (in another way : if they don\'t disgust you), go on and watch Corpse Party. Otherwise, you won\'t appreciate it. Simple but honest. Evil Serie, Obscure I & II, Dead Island, Outlast and more. That means, I could be considered as someone who would not totally mess things up if placed in a comparable situation ; well I\'m saying these words behind my computer, it might be presomptuous but not totally wrong.So, when I watched Corpse Party, it became extremely irritating, frustrating or annoying to notice most characters had such an irrelevant & inadapted behaviour. For example, whenever you are lost with someone in an unknown place, human normal behaviour would be : staying close to the other person and exploring together. But... it was probably too much to ask here. Yeah indeed, all the characters responded present to the classic horror cliche, like wandering alone, trying to act as if nothing was scary (come on, you find yourself locked in a dark destroyed school, do you really need to apply cream on your butt ? ) and willing to save everyone, because you are heartful.As you could already understand, I did not like Corpse Party. Behind my screen, I had to restrain my insults or screams, because it became really tearing to see every character acting as if they never watched an horror movie. Especially this guy who lets his younger sister going to the toilets with a TOTALLY unknown weird girl... dude you got to face dead bodies, blood and guts AND you just leave your sister to a random person ? Talking about her, she finds herself trapped because she peed on herself and decided to leave her wet pant in a desk (for real).I surely look mean, hard or harsh criticizing these teenagers main characters. But the anime just managed to gather every big cliche you can meet in horror movies, which was quite annoying to watch at some point. However, it would be a lie to tell this anime sucked a lot. No, indeed, the global dark scary and rusty atmostphere was efficient : it inspired a place you never want to be locked in. Basically, no one wants to be in an old school by a rainy night, but especially not with crazy teenagers and murderous ghosts.Nevertheless, the major point of Corpse Party remains the very (not to say extremely) high level of violence and gore. Usually, an horror movie catches your feeling easier than anime, considering it shows you real humans being slaughtered, tortured, murdered. But it did not matter for this anime, I don\'t think anyone stood still while watching a very young girl being tortured, having her eye extracted from her head and stabbed with a knife... Yeah, you got it right : this anime is famous because of how horrificly bloody it can be.It also has an OK scenario, boarding a conclusion. You can easily notice that the whole show has a video game rythm, including a sort of ""hints research"" that leads to something classic in any horror work : a revengeance perpetuated by a murdered ghost who came back to haunt other people. As expected the denouement takes place when the entity finds peace : classic but not necessarily bad.Well, my own conclusion is easy : if you appreciate gore, blood, guts and torture (in another way : if they don\'t disgust you), go on and watch Corpse Party. Otherwise, you won\'t appreciate it. Simple but honest.', 'I usually don\'t write reviews, but I couldn\'t just ignore this....anime after watching it. From what I saw it was based on a horror game, and that\'s all fine. To me this was just an excuse to use as much gore as possible. In short, it was a damn gore fest. Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t mind gore, as long as it has a solid plot to keep things interesting. The idea behind it wasn\'t that bad, but in all honesty it wasn\'t my cup of tea, and I didn\'t enjoy even a second. The only reason I kept watching was to see if...it had even a decent explanation as to why all of this was happening. In all honesty, there was only one character I actually liked in the whole thing, and he wound up dead. Most of the events were predictable, at least to me, and I knew who\'s gonna die and who\'s gonna survive in the end, \'cause it\'s more than obvious. Most of the time I found myself thinking ""Are you stupid?"" about the actions of certain characters, a lot like my previous experience with ""Another"", which I also found to be quite stupid and intolerable.In short, if you like a lot of gore in your anime, and you don\'t really care much for the plot, then by all means be my guest. Otherwise, don\'t touch this anime...just don\'t. it had even a decent explanation as to why all of this was happening.

They Cry,its way better.', 'Corpse Party? That’s not who I voted for.Story:Coprse Party progresses quite fast, which makes sense considering there’s only four episodes. But it manages to not skip over important content or create immense plotholes on its way…at least not more than it would have done anyway. The story itself is a bit confusing, it did not fully understand the rules of this ghost dimension or what was going on in general. Some of the explanations came out of nowhere. The appeal of this show is a different one though, so it doesn’t affect the enjoyment a whole lot, but it is noticeable enough to make it...potentially hard to follow. Of course, what people most likely came to see is the splatter. This is easily one of the goriest shows out there. It’s mostly kept in “realistic” boundaries, but the one scene where somebody gets smashed high speed against a wall looked totally over the top. Anyway, as mediocre as the whole story is, the ending was surprisingly good and satisfying.6/10Art:The character design is not the most inventive one. I dare say, they all look rather bland. But that’s okay, because they are supposed to be normal students and what better way to portray them as such than by making them look accordingly? The animation was good from what I can see, the directing was as well. At times however, the setting was a bit too dark for my taste. I know, you wanna make it spooky and stuff, but I would have appreciated to see more details from time to time. Speaking of details, being an OVA, Corpse Party can get away with much more gruesome stuff than a tv show ever could. And boy, do they use this possibility. If you have a weak stomach or are not all that comfortable with gore, then this is not for you. I would have preferred to see severed body parts look a bit more messy than this, the cuts were way too clean. Somebody in the production crew also seems to have a serious bowel fetish. Do people even have so much (many?) bowels inside? But hey, it was a bloody mess, that’s what you wanted, right?7/10Sound:Music plays an important part in the genre, you wouldn’t be horrified by a happy pop song, would you? Although American Psycho proves me wrong here. Anyway, the usual thing to do is have scary music, especially during suspense scenes. It’s as easy as it is effective and Corpse Party does it well. The opening song is also a pretty good one, dispersing the atmosphere of horror without doing it with a hammer. Pretty much the same goes for the ending song. The sound effects were disgusting, as they should be. Cutting somebody’s head in half accompanied by a squishy sound of slicing makes it as disturbing as it is supposed to, great job there. The voice acting was okay, they managed to sound convincingly frightened, that’s enough for me. The only voices that bugged me a little were Mayu and Yuka, who tried too hard to sound cutesy (I shall scourge myself for criticizing Eri Kitamura).8/10Characters:Corpse Party is partially a slasher show, so it has the same problem that pretty much every slasher movie has. You don’t have time to establish the characters before you gotta start the killing. To be honest, I didn’t care for any of the characters, though obviously it’s uncomfortable to see a little girl being tortured to death, but in general, I didn’t feel particularly bad for any of them, because I didn’t know who the hell these people are. I acknowledge that they tried to portray some of them as sympathetic, but there are only so many fucks I can give about somebody who had about three lines of dialogue before their death. Much more interesting are Sachiko and her motives. Creepy children don’t usually creep me out the slightest, but she was portrayed more as sinister than just oooh spooky. I found her reasons to make sense (as much as this bizarre setting can make any) and her ultimate fate was conclusional and fitting. I have no idea however what was up with that ghost chick with the glasses who delivered exposition and then she somehow was evil all along. Maybe it was for the better they didn’t dig deeper into characterizations, we might have ended up with an incoherent mess of a cast, it’s confusing enough as it is.5/10Enjoyment:The mix between traditional spooky horror and slasher gore was interesting. The story was confusing, but I could focus on the violence, so that wasn’t all that problematic and again, I really liked the ending. I was a bit baffled how everybody so quickly accepted that there were ghosts walking around, but then I just blamed it on cultural differences. Seeing everybody getting killed off was fun, as I wasn’t emotionally invested. I was also glad that the show was relatively short, otherwise I would’ve probably gotten bored around episode 6 or 7. I can recommend this to anyone who just wants to see people getting violently slaughtered, not so much if you’re looking for something more meaningful. For what it was, it was okay, nothing more, nothing less.6/10Overall:6.4/10 potentially hard to follow. Of course, what people most likely came to see is the splatter.

If you haven't played the game or at least seen a walkthrough I strongly suggest doing so before watching this as it will help you understand a little better what is happening.Don't expect too much with the character development of the main characters because its main focus is not that.

The story is fantastic and is very interesting with a lot...of twists and turns.This is extremely graphic and I mean GRAPHIC! There were some scenes where I actually had to look away because of how detailed some of them were with the killing. This is a true horror anime where it doesn't give you much to work with when it comes to main characters that are trapped there, but instead fills its time with a rich plot and backstory of the haunted school they are in and what actually went down there.Overall I would recommend this anime it was a blast to watch and is very gory and graphic.

Let me explain with story;STORY AND CHARACTER:The setup is that a group of high school characters and a couple of extras, are accidentally teleported into a pocket dimension. That\'s as far as I can go without giving spoilers. The progression of the plot is very haphazard and scattershot. There is essentially no plot here, it is just sequences going one...after another with no rhyme or reason. The decisions characters make, are completely irrelevant because none of these characters are established and thus, we have no expectations from them aside from what little we can surmise.No. The story is just a backdrop for the events that take place. There is no story, there are no characters. No one is setup or established to subvert or match our expectations.ART:This is where the anime shines. The entire point of this series is to show off it\'s extremely brutal, gruesome and inflinching art. Characters will literally be ripped apart in plain view; characters that would otherwise be ""Immune"" or ""Protected"" are tortured to death in graphic detail. It truly has no pity or forgiveness. The detail upon which certain characters are just massacred is almost breathtaking. From torn flesh, to blood, to entrails being spewed, to a characters face being ripped apart from the inside, it\'s all lovingly rendered for the viewer to ingest.I found it  both repulsive and fascinating. This is the draw of the series, this is the one thing it has going for it; from a fairly psychological and intriguing first episode, it completely goes off the rails in the 2 - 4 episodes where the writers cannot wait to find a new messed up way to dismember or otherwise disembowel the characters in their show.This series is not for the faint of heart or the squeamish, I can safely say I have never seen a more gruesome gorefest than this... and I\'ve seen a lot of gory media.ENJOYMENT:I found enjoyment in the first episode from the despair of the characters trapped in an isolated area, it is wildly different in tone and execution as episodes 2 through 4. So the first episode had that going for it... the rest had unflinching, brutal gore to an extreme degree. This is what I enjoyed.OVERALL:Since it\'s a short series, I can very confidently state that I recommend this to absolutely everyone that is even remotely interested in horror, gore and violence. It is short enough that even if you don\'t like it, it will be over very quickly and you will have treated yourself to one of the most extreme helpings of the genre.To summarize;If you like deep and complex stories, this is not for you.If you like well developed and interesting characters, this is not for you.If you are weak or frail of mind, this is not for you.If you like gore, absolutely watch this.If you like horror, absolutely watch this, you cannot miss this.That is all. after another with no rhyme or reason.

There were a few side characters that only got about 10 seconds of screen time when they were actually important in the story.When I got to the end, I was let down.

So, as a result, the plot is rushed and many loopholes. So, it would be very confusing for some, especially if they have not seen the game that the anime is based off.Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is not written well in my opinion, also they have left out a lot of things that the original game had which made the game more appealing. The ending also bothered me a lot, without spoiling the ending, I would say that the ending was horribly cliched and poorly written. There were no plot...twists or anything, unlike the original Corpse Party game.Art: 6/10Warning: a lot of blood and body partsThe art was fairly well done in my opinion. The character designs were average and there was no character which stood out from the rest. The art has darker tones to it, as expected of a horror anime and it conveys the feeling of hopelessness well. I think that the blood and gore in Corpse Party is overkill. The gore was in such an unrealistic amount that it seems comical. However, the body parts did make me feel uncomfortable, although it was not very detailed. I think if much more detail was put into the body parts, it would have been more horrific.Sound: 7/10The OST of Corpse Party: Tortured Souls was fine, the opening and ending were average. The voice acting was memorable. The voice acting left shivers running down my spine, especially the laughs and screams which add on to the horror side of Corpse Party: Tortured Souls.Characters: 4/10The characters were generally static characters and rather forgettable, with the exception of Sachiko, whose character was one of the better ones among the cast. Sachiko is downright creepy and her motives and personality did have development.The other characters were not very interesting and I was rather annoyed at their stupidity, especially Satoshi. But we've got to cut the characters some slack, after all there were only four episodes and how much character development could four episodes provide for the cast?Enjoyment: 5/10So, was Corpse Party: Tortured Souls scary?My answer is not really. It was a lot less scarier than I thought it would be. However, the animation in the first episode did make me uncomfortable. The screaming and laughing contributed to the discomfort I felt watching Corpse Party: Tortured Souls. Sadly, as I watched further, the anime lost its horrific appeal. I did not enjoy it very much, plus the generic characters decreased the enjoyment level. The show was cringey and luckily, I finished it quickly.Overall: 5/10Strong points: Art (6/10), Sound (7/10)Weaknesses: Story (4/10), Character (4/10)To sum up my review, Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is rated a 5/10. This show was overrated in my opinion and the story and character parts were disappointing. It isn't the best horror anime I've watched but it was certainly one of the goriest. If you're looking for horror anime which actually has character development and a well-written story, then Corpse Party: Tortured Souls isn't really the right anime for you to watch.If you're planning to watch Corpse Party: Tortured Souls, I suggest that you don't watch it at night and bring along a bucket, if you don't want to have nightmares.Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed it. Have a nice day! twists or anything, unlike the original Corpse Party game.Art: 6/10Warning: a lot of blood and body partsThe art was fairly well done in my opinion.

But we've got to cut the characters some slack, after all there were only four episodes and how much character development could four episodes provide for the cast?Enjoyment: 5/10So, was Corpse Party: Tortured Souls scary?My answer is not really. It was a lot less scarier than I thought it would be. However, the animation in the first episode did make me uncomfortable. The screaming and laughing contributed to the discomfort I felt watching Corpse Party: Tortured Souls. Sadly, as I watched further, the anime lost its horrific appeal. I did not enjoy it very much, plus the generic characters decreased the enjoyment level. The show was cringey and luckily, I finished it quickly.Overall: 5/10Strong points: Art (6/10), Sound (7/10)Weaknesses: Story (4/10), Character (4/10)To sum up my review, Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is rated a 5/10. This show was overrated in my opinion and the story and character parts were disappointing. It isn't the best horror anime I've watched but it was certainly one of the goriest. If you're looking for horror anime which actually has character development and a well-written story, then Corpse Party: Tortured Souls isn't really the right anime for you to watch.If you're planning to watch Corpse Party: Tortured Souls, I suggest that you don't watch it at night and bring along a bucket, if you don't want to have nightmares.Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed it.

The story is fairly simple yet not explained that well in the anime at all, but since I was an all ready fan of the series I didn't really care that the story was poorly executed since all I was there for was Gore and Spooks. The art in Corpse Party is quite pretty to look at since it was a 4 episode OVA they seemed to have time to Polish a lot of the look and it really shows, the...characters never looked better. The sound is also very good, the opening and the ending song are both really good, but what really stands out are the atmospheric tracks in the anime. The character development is something of desire due to some characters only getting 1 screen time til they are killed, but again as a fan it didn't bother me at all. If your a fan a Corpse Party then there is a high chance that you'll like this anime adaption of it, to a outsider this anime would be mediocre but I still say give it a chance, but you might want to google a wiki for the story if you get confused.

I will be reviewing all the slice of a life anime's i've seen so far, so don't mind adding me as a friend if you are just like me a big fan of slice of a life anime's and want to discover more>Corpse party. The anime that's based on a rpg. I didn't play the RPG. But i've watched the Pewdiepie serie's that he play's it.  The game is build on RPG maker. And then getting an own anime? That's pretty impressive....But is the anime just as good as the RPG game? Let's find out!Story.Even though i'm a big fan of slice of a life anime's. After i've seen the video's of pewdiepie, and found out there's an anime based on that rpg game. I just needed to see it. Ofcourse i keep in mind, just as key's visual novels and the anime's can be different from the orginal story. And that's oke. It start's in the classroom with some a little introduction of the cast. And then the actual story begin's. After a failed attempt on a charm the ground collapses and they fall into a pit. Once the first character's wake up they find theirself in a school. But not the school where they actually were. In this creepy mansion is a scary atmosphere. They have to find a way out of this school. While wild creature's including some of the classmate's are also becoming a danger. The ingredient's are really good for making a really nice story. But sadly enough it just end's up more in a story that just try's to make it discussting as possible. And the plot isn't that big as you hope.  So a good 7 for the story.Art.They didn't hold back while creating the anime. If you are a big fan of gore, where nothing is blurred out. Then yes this anime is good for you. The amount of detail in the death body's. Or the people in the serie that are injured is made very well.  The design of the character's are also really well made. And the background's are also ok. So here's a nice bloody 8 for the amount of detailSoundI wasn't a big fan of the sound's in the serie. It's just over the top. When someone get's stabbed for example it just sound's not realistic. And remind's me of hentai sound effect's. The same goes as the music. They use mainly broken piano's or detective-ish music. Nothing really outstanding. I give this a 6.Character's.This is pretty hard, i do like the character's in the serie. But the problem with having so big cast in a serie, that's also pretty short. There isn't any time to tell information about all character's. Allot of the cast feels like a filler character that just is there, waiting to get slaughtered. So i would say it's a decent 7.Enjoyment.I did enjoy the serie. Even though the cast wasn't really special and the music was not special. There are some moment's that made me think ohhhh painfull or would freak me out. (Let's just say i'm not a big fan of scissor's at the moment). So i would give it a nice decent 7.Overall.Is it a good thriller / horror anime? Well it's decent. It's a little over the top focussing on making at painfull and disturbing as possible. It's short. But gave me a better view behind the RPG story how the school would look like. And that's cool! I will give this anime a nice 7 total.

I was on the edge of my seat with all of the Twists. Recommended anime for anybody who likes Gore and Suspense. There was no cliche romances as I've seen in many other animes that sometimes cause the anime to steer away from the Actual plot. Didn't lile that there was only four episodes and I wish they could have made more so we could get to know the Characters a bit better. The plot is well done and like no other horror anime I've seen before. It feels like...you're actually inside the School and the overall atmosphere of the anime is scary and Eerie. you're actually inside the School and the overall atmosphere of the anime is scary and Eerie."", ""The story of Corpse Party is about a group of High School Students conducting a ritual in their abandoned school. Right off the bat you’ll know how bad this title is – lightning strikes constantly in spooky-wooky way and the amount of ridiculous dutch angles makes you wonder if they were even intentional, or the person in charge of the camera was just drunk or falling asleep from boredom. It doesn’t take long for our lovable retards and their overly moe teacher to fall into the alternate world filled with blood, corpses, blood, despair, blood, loneliness, blood, violence, blood, ghosts, blood and most importantly, mystery...blood. If you’re getting Silent Hill 1 vibes at this point, you’re more or less right. Just like in SH 1 we get a young girl responsible for everything and school full of tormented souls. The only difference is that in SH, the school was just one of the locations and, most importantly, the Japanese Team Silent wanted to scare you with sex and violence without showing you these thnigs. they were hinted, but never shown in your face. Here… not so much. The anime definitely feels like it’s being written by a complete sadist who considers Higurashi no Naku Koro ni a way of life and masturbates with a vice. Without any reasons, the protagonist and her friend start talking about lubricant to make their asses shiny then share a yuri moment together, only for the friend character to leave our heroine alone to get her part of a torn paper doll used as a catalyst of the ritual. What follows is a mix of a panty shot, tentacle rape and soon after, gore. I know that the tradition of horror films is to make the cast dumber than they already are in order for the interesting things to happen, but Corpse Party ruins everything with moe heroines. While it is explained that the windows cannot break in this world, before it happens, our heroines don’t even think of using one of the many boxes or tables to break these. They’re squeaky, super delicate and hopeless while facing the hostile ghosts. It goes even further, though. The author thought of adding a loli character as well… Of course, there are male characters here too. They are bland, stupid and get less screen time than the girls. One of them actually does bring his little sister along. It doesn’t take much time for a gripping subplot involving her having to take a pee start. Instead of letting the brat urinate int he corner of the destroyed bathroom, her brother decides to drag her around the corpse-filled school, then leaves her without a second thought to a creepy little girl, promises that he’ll wait, leaves this place and you can guess what happens next.At this point, I was hoping that the author at least will have some dignity to not show us the loli urinating all over herself. Unfortunately, he went further. She urinates herself, takes off her panties, so we can get a close look at those (and for Otaku to start sniffing the screen) and stating that she’ll go on without these. You know, Japan… These are the situations where I really hate this country. Cultural differences aside, such scenes are simply distasteful. They’re not here to portray anything, they don’t contain shock value or development, they’re just here to appeal to a really horrible group of anime fans. and because it’s in title containing so much cruelty already, I can say that Corpse Party may be my contender for the worst anime of this year, just because of how insulting it is and people actually charged money for it. Even Silent Hill: Downpour, the game that doesn’t make sense at all, does put urine in a better use, by mentioning how the warden in prison the protagonist was in got framed by another corrupted warden and beaten up to the point he was mentally retarded. And even then it was simply a verbal mentioning. This anime is simply unpleasant to look at. At first, I was laughing out loud at how overused the lightning and dutch angles are. However, starting from the third episode, the anime decides to focus on boring expositions and repetitive torture scenes. And even if you can't bear the sight of an eye gouged out, no worries, this anime makes you not care about it. Especially after showing such scenes about 15 times. Same goes to tongues being cut off, these are the two gore scenes you’ll see the most – tongues and eyes. I’m not asking for variety, but every time you’ll throw a gore scene at the viewer, complete with loud shrieking, you better do your best at shocking, not boring. Remember the scene in Texas Chainsaw Massacre where the heroine gets tied up to the chair and forced to eat corpse along with the demented family? This scene had much less gore and more shock value by simply using a visual filter and camera angles to portray hysteric terror of a character. And what do we get? Tongues, eyes, tongues, blood,  and vomit. There’s no build up, no tension. Simply because the violence is overused to the point you don’t care. And that actually stopped being funny to me. Instead you’re forced to sit through a marathon of the girls getting violated. The anime also plays a lot of stupid cliches like the characters always spreading up instead of sticking together, or one of the guys going crazy tot he point he starts killing others. Everything just for the sake of more violence. From what I know, Corpse Party was supposed to be an adventure game with the emphasis on the atmosphere. Here, the two episodes contain more guts than a single story arc of Higurashi, which, to its credit, at least padded it out with some decent build up. The animation in this OVA is poor, to say at least. While I do appreciate the lack of censorship, which is a cheap way of selling people more DVD/BD copies, the actual quality of the animation is average at most. The characters look simple, like in most modern titles, the lip synching is off at few parts and some moments just look awkward. It’s like they wanted to make their violence stand out, and even this doesn’t look as good as in the old OVAs. As far as the sounds go, it’s really bad. While the male voices are passable, all females sound overly cute with obnoxious squeaky tone, no matter if it’s loli or a teacher. The music is a mix of ambience and piano, filled with depressing sounds working perfectly with the overall mood of this pathethic excuse of a horror. If you want a good guide how to not scare your three month old child, Corpse Party is literally a textbook case here. The spooky sounds straight out of bad horror flicks are just laughable. Even the non-horror films, like Pi, had a better usage of sound during more intense moments. Hell, this movie alone is much more involving than Corpse Party, being made with little money, but huge effort. blood. If you’re getting Silent Hill 1 vibes at this point, you’re more or less right.

And wow, has it stuck with me?Yes, yes it has.Corpse Party had this effect on me, of which most anime fail to do. I felt almost every kind of emotion during the four episodes. At the beginning, I was happy like the others. However, the story turned bittersweet and left me petrified.The story, though I enjoyed the anime, was nothing I hadn't seen before. Not to mention the various holes and how abrupt most of the show seemed to be. One thing that I thrive on when watching anime, is that characters have backstories. I need to...know how they all became close, in order to feel more engaged with the story. Corpse Party only displayed a backstory nearer to the end of the last episode. Even so, the backstory was about the antagonist, and the protagonists received nothing at all.The art style couldn't have been more fitting to the series' mood. It was dark, eerie, and everything I had hoped and expected from the synopsis. Although, I felt as if the artist spent the most time on the violence, rather than how the characters looked and the settings. This is evident in almost every scene. The characters are simplistic and look more like backing characters, rather than the centre of the show. The same thing can be said about their personalities. All of the characters seemed the same. In my view, I would have preferred the characters if they were more cliche, like in a lot of shows. At least they may have been more iconic.However, I feel as if this show really brought something new to the horror genre. It felt like I was watching a horror movie. The sounds were spot on, which made the show so eerie and creepy. As for the opening, Hoshikuzu no RING is definitely an underrated opening in anime. Since I first heard it, it has stayed as one of my favourites of all time.Although the story wasn't the best, a proper story-line would have removed the show from what makes it stand out in the horror genre. It would have changed the whole effect of the show entirely. The audience for the show would have been entirely different. A story-line would have distracted the audience from the main point of the series. The gore. The series was entirely made to scare and horrify you, not to make you engrossed by a story. I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did, if the plot was to differ in any way.My ratings:Story: 6Art: 7Sound: 9Character: 7Enjoyment: 9Overall: 8 know how they all became close, in order to feel more engaged with the story.

It's a party full of corpses people! But, really. It has a lot of corpse in it. No jokesSo, Corpse Party is truly a gore anime. It has nothing much to offer except for the gore and the occasional story thrown in between that sets the whole thing in motion. The sound, the vibe is good enough and the OP is suitable with the story. The character development.... Nothing special. You don't even get to love them all since it's only 4 episode long but you didn't came here all the way here just for the character, did you? The brutality in this...anime is on par with Another and Higurashi in my opinion.That's all I can say about this anime, I think. It's nothing special really.

No awesome story whatsoever but the gore is a real deal"", ""This might as well be the scariest I've ever seen, excluding Higurashi because I actually found it a bit boring. The sadism in this anime appears better to me.So the story's good, but it's missing a couple of important details, such as what happens between each episode as some details aren't covered, including an epilogue (optional) of what happened in the end after one failed to return (not including spoilers).The gory sounds are...vivid. It's realistic and the intro syncs well with the show, so that's a plus.The character development is pretty good, but I don't get why or how the teacher dies twice....This anime should have more consistency with what happens to its characters, unless each episode is a different ending, which seems unlikely because some episodes would end too early near the end and miss out on a LOT of info.I found this pretty enjoyable because of the suspense and death scenes and I liked the cringe moment that happens just before suspense builds up.Overall, this was a great anime to watch, but looks very incomplete. I would suggest adding an epilogue to this, but it appears that probably won't happen.

If you plan to watch the show I suggest you to read it but the ones who are watching right now i suggest you to not read it .This OVA series tortured my soul (hahahahahahahahaha most original joke 2018) . While watching it with my 12 year old brother we talked this about actually how disgusting yet not scary this series is . This OVA series is so one dimensional because storyline was messed up with plotholes yet it try to tell us a serious story with every characters die . This anime failed with not one way too many ways ....I am going to take all of this in parts :Story: 1/10Damn it story was such a mess . When you try to make a long visual novel story to a 4 episode OVA it usually became a bad story because it always falls too short for storytelling but Corpse Party try to add characters dying without even developed them makes the story too forgettable with that storytelling becomes more shorter than ever before . This makes scenes longer and it gives really disgusting points so you can't even focus to storytelling on that . Story is generic too . I have seen a lot of horror movies that has a group of friends trying to do some rituals and fail to a bad end . This animes story is actually like that so I was dissapointed how unoriginal this series was .Art: 1/10A horror anime with moe artstyle...I just don't know what to say.Sound: 7/10I like the opening and never listened the ending . Yes I hate music .Characters or victims: 1/10Characters were very bland . I think we can agree with that . This is what happens when you try to make a 4 episode OVA with a LOT of characters . You simply forget them after you finish the anime . They became undeveloped , generic , dumbass , bland , etc. Just like a lot of horror anime this anime try to make all generic anime characters (little sister , girl who gives no fucks , a normal teacher , best girl try to save everyone , best girls love interest , the one who loves best girl but couldn't even have a date with her , etc.) and try to kill everyone of them . Actually seeing generic and bland characters dying don't scare me because I never saw them developed throughout the series and I am used to see them die in a lot of ways .Horror fact: 1/10This anime wasn't scary . It was just disgusting and boring . Like I say if you want to make a good horror anime you must develop the characters or the main monsters . It really gives of a scary feeling yet an emotional aspect to the anime but 4 episode lenght was the problem of the OVA . Every 10 minutes a character that developed 0 times dies in a sadistic way . It doesn't even scare you it makes you feel disgusted . I bet Guts will be sad to see how many man losing their guts in this series (now that was a original joke) . They only look disgusting not scary .Overall: 2/10The main problem on this series is the shortness of it . If it were 24 episode and make the characters developed well maybe i will give it a 7/10 but anime really falls short . For sake of the good opening I will give a 2/10.Thank you for reading.

I just don\'t think this should be a point of entry for anyone into the franchise of Corpse Party. In case somebody reads this and doesn\'t know: Corpse Party is originally a japanese horror game made in RPG Maker. It was remade several times, until recently, in the end of 2021. I played that version, it\'s got great visuals and sounds (the voice actors are terrific), and the story is full of twists and turns.This OVA is a summary of the story of that game. As every short adaptation, it...fails because it\'s rushed.STORYThe story is from 1996 (the date the original game was released). As such, it is quite cliché. Stereotyped students get thrown in another dimension, a very crude one, where they can get killed, possessed, go crazy, or simply die from human needs depending on how long they stay. They have to get out of this hell.It\'s a pretty solid concept, and Corpse Party is the best version of it in my opinion : it\'s got so many threats, and the way to get out of there is so complex, that you really feel the same dispair as the characters.The anime managed to stay faithful to the game. But it\'s a 20 hours long game and there\'s only four OVAs, less than 30 minutes each. You know the rest: everything is so rushed that nothing ever has a real impact on the viewer.Another issue compared to the original game is the many branches it contained. A series obviously can\'t tell many alternative stories at the same time. The game has so many ends to discover, and you HAVE to discover all of them to get the full experience.The series did try to put a lot of different routes together. And honestly, they nailed it! The routes they adapted are mixed together in a perfect way, it never feels like several stories told at the same time.Honestly, the only issue is the rythm. If only they had made FIVE episodes! I mean, seriously, the base game has five chapters, why make only four episodes???? That just didn\'t make any sense, and that destroys the entire thing. The final episode, in particular, is a complete mess. I read so many comments of people who don\'t get what happened in that episode. That\'s because it goes so fast on the explanations! Nothing is clear in the end: the origin of the curse, the way to get out of it, even the fate of the surviving characters is unclear.The only way to understand the post-credit scene is to play the game. There\'s just no way to get what they\'re saying with the OVA alone.ARTNothing to say against it. It\'s not exceptional, but it\'s still great and very faithful to the game. They only made two changes that I don\'t get : Naho\'s eyes and the doll.Naho is described explicitly as having ""eyes like dead fish."" Yet, in the series, she has normal eyes.As for the doll, I also don\'t get the change, it was pointless.These are minor issues, of course. In fact, I wouldn\'t call it issues. They\'re just changes that don\'t make sense.SOUNDSolid OST faithful to the game. Exceptional work from the seiyuus. They\'re the same voice actors as the game, and frankly, I\'m glad they kept them, they\'re perfect.CHARACTERThe characters are straight out of the 90\'s. But one thing, in the game, kept them interesting : their believable behaviours. The way they react to what is happening to them is totally understandable, and while they are sometimes stupid, their reasoning is always explained.In the series, the characters all look more dull than their game counterparts. This mainly happens because they changed the way they react to the stuff. It\'s still a cool crew, they just felt less real to me.ENJOYMENTTortured Souls is a very faithful adaption. Honestly, and I almost never say it, I can feel how passionate they were about this project. They all made their best to make it work.The problem is this CAN\'T work. You can\'t take a 20 hours long game and make it into four episodes of 30 minutes. Five episodes could have worked better, although it would still be far from enough for the amount of story the game has. I mean, most secondary characters were cut and most stories aren\'t shown, As a result, this OVA series is very far from the game it adapts.It\'s still a solid anime horror series. Just...

But I think that what makes this anime good, is how they go from being the best friends, to a lot of blood and guts. It\'s not about the deaths, not about how they are in different ""worlds"", is about how they wanted to be inseparable friends, but ended up being cheated and dying. But besides that, I think that the open...end leaves you with the doubt of ""What really happened?"" But it also gives you that feeling of suspense, which I think is something that you can feel while watching the whole anime, but is frustrating if it happens at the end.•Art (9/10)-The vast majority of the scenes are dark, even if it gives that feeling of horror, sometimes you can\'t watch properly what is happening. But then we have the school, the classroom, shadows, lightnings, earthquakes, broken windows, and well, blood and organs everywhere. I liked how they go from a nice girl to a lot of guts stuck in a wall, but I also liked how they drew it to make it look horrible.•Sound (9/10)-It helps to give you the suspense and the fear of what\'s happening. It has the common sounds of an horror movie, but they are necessary to make you feel inside the anime. I liked that they used them as a way to add fear but not as the principal way, how they used well the volume of those sounds.•Characters (7/10)-Even though the majority of them die, they gave a little emphasis on every character. I liked how they start by giving the suspicion that Seiko secretly loves Naomi, how they show Sakutaro\'s mental health, how they let me  know who loves whom and how they gave an unique death to everyone of them.-I think it\'s a little illogical how Satoshi could think ""Well I\'m locked in a haunted school, I\'m gonna let my little sister go to the forest with a ghost and I\'ll be inside while she returns, I\'ll tell her just to scream if something happens"". Well, guess what, you won\'t hear her, and if you do, the door is obviously going to be locked.•Enjoyment (9/10)-It is a good story, it really wrapped me and it\'s really short.

I had really enjoyed the story and atmosphere of the games, and it seemed like it would translate perfectly to an anime. But... it really didn\'t. Now, I still hold the firm belief that this anime COULD have been good, but ultimately, it\'s mediocre at best.Story (5): The story in corpse party Tortured Souls is the same as the one from the first PSP game, although the actions of the characters differ a bit, and it doesn\'t follow the ""true ending"" route from the PSP games. Instead, it goes for a...darker version of the story. Without venturing into spoiler territory, I will say that there is a lot of death in this one, a lot more than there was in the games.Really, this is the problem with this anime\'s story.

There were some highlights, Yoshiki, Morshige, Seiko, and maybe Yuka. But, it\'s nullified by the awfulness of Satoshi and Ayumi.

They\'re ok, but if you\'re looking for gore and death scenes, there are much better options out there.Overall, there\'s no real reason to watch this anime.

However, it was far from the best. Given the enjoyment many have derived from this franchise's game series, Tortured Souls had a lot to live up to, and it simply failed to do as such.Story: 4The story broadly follows the events of the game. However, the producers made a point to shoehorn deaths into this anime that did not occur in the game, purely to add more violent scenes. This brings me to one of my qualms with this anime: sometimes, it feels like there is just violence for...the sake of it.Now, don't get me wrong. Gore is a defining essence of the Corpse Party franchise. Corpse Party wouldn't be Corpse Party without it. However, it seems here that the producers had just taken the morbid charm of the game and ran with it, to bring a sense of violence into this series that was almost cartoonish. It came across as though the producers were trying to emulate the shock value of the games, but, due to the exaggerated nature of this gore within the anime only served to distract from the plot and cheapen the story.It's also worth noting that the producers have attempted to condense hours worth of gameplay into 4 episodes. This means that at times the story feels rushed and doesn't adequately capture the charm of the game franchise.Art: 7The art is fine. It's nothing to complain about and nor is it anything exceptional. The animation team have done a good job of illustrating the tone and atmosphere in Heavenly Host, and the characters look broadly the same as they did in the games.Sound: 7Sound is pretty good. The sound in the OVA would probably outperform that of the game, in my opinion. The voice actors do a good job of capturing the emotion portrayed in the game, so I can't complain on that front. The music is not all to my taste, however, it does get the job done.Characters: 4Given that this is 4 episodes long, it cannot be said that any character development, aside from perhaps Sachiko, is allowed for. Not many of the characters are particularly interesting and even characters who were interesting in the original game, often did not have this shown in the series.Enjoyment: 4Given that I came into this series with the expectations of being as impressed as I was with the games, I have to say that having constantly compared this to the game hindered my enjoyment. Reasons why are aforementioned. In fairness, it does at times have the tension that can be experienced in the original game, but given that this was so rushed, I do not feel it could be fully appreciated. With this in mind, the producers of Tortured Souls, I feel, failed to exploit some of the main charm points that the game delivered.Overall: 5Tortured Souls honestly does have its good points. The sound and animation certainly get the job done and it's not terrible. However, the fact that the producers overexaggerated the amount of violence to the extent that it distracted from the plot and also the rushed nature of this anime means that Tortured Souls leaves much to be desired. If you have 2 hours to spare, then I'd say give it a try. the sake of it.Now, don't get me wrong. Gore is a defining essence of the Corpse Party franchise.

Lmao. I am going to keep this review short . A little spoilers ahead (Maybe).Ok. Is this show a complete clusterfuck of plot and characters? Definitely. Did I enjoy watching this show? Definitely. The story is about a bunch of kids who get transported to a haunted school and all hell breaks loose. Now, how and why they got transported doesn\'t matter. Coz it\'s a ""horror"" anime and we don\'t talk about...that here.... What follows is a gruesome turn of events with kids getting smashed to bits and pieces, kids getting stabbed in the eye, kids getting their tongues cut off again and again and again. And Intestines. A lot of intestines.The genre of the show is horror but honestly I didn\'t feel any of that shit while watching it. If I had to name the genre, I\'d say - Gore, Comedy. Sometimes the death scenes are so funny- there is literally a scene where a box falls over a girl and her head comes off. Now how tf do you do that... As for the characters, what do you expect from a 4 episode long ""horror"" anime. Nothing much to say about anything else in the show. Obvious turn of events, obvious plot twists and an obvious ending. (But , the OP is good.)Having said all this doesn\'t undermine the fact that I enjoyed watching the show. I\'d not recommend this to people if they want quality content but if you want a little bit of entertainment and can handle all the gore , then go ahead.Overall 5/10 - Solely based on enjoyment that here.... What follows is a gruesome turn of events with kids getting smashed to bits and pieces, kids getting stabbed in the eye, kids getting their tongues cut off again and again and again. And Intestines. A lot of intestines.The genre of the show is horror but honestly I didn\'t feel any of that shit while watching it. If I had to name the genre, I\'d say - Gore, Comedy. Sometimes the death scenes are so funny- there is literally a scene where a box falls over a girl and her head comes off. Now how tf do you do that... As for the characters, what do you expect from a 4 episode long ""horror"" anime. Nothing much to say about anything else in the show. Obvious turn of events, obvious plot twists and an obvious ending. (But , the OP is good.)Having said all this doesn\'t undermine the fact that I enjoyed watching the show. I\'d not recommend this to people if they want quality content but if you want a little bit of entertainment and can handle all the gore , then go ahead.Overall 5/10 - Solely based on enjoyment', ""If you love the game and REALLY want more content, go ahead and watch it I guess. Just don't expect it to be that good.To be fair, they only had four episodes to work with. It's still pretty bad.There's blood, there's gore, and if you're a fan of the series, that's a good thing. It nailed that aspect of the franchise, but fumbled pretty much everything else. The characters don't get much new or interesting development. In general, they're less fleshed out and explored than they are in the game. That's understandable since it's only four episodes, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. "", 'Dont watch this Anime in the night while its stormy outside and your alone in your room!! (Well at least thats what I did.. and yes it was really creepy)I watched the Anime after I watched a lets play from the games, so i was actually pretty prepared. Even tho it was even more creepy because you knew what was about to happen.The Anime is creepy from the first seconds of the first episode, so if you already fell uncomfortable its not the best to keep watching it, because after that the hardcore horror stuff is about to happen. (just saying..)I watched the Anime about...three times, because even if it is creepy af it is still a good Anime with a good story behind it.(If you really like horror stuff watch the Anime with headphones to increase the creepiness :D) three times, because even if it is creepy af it is still a good Anime with a good story behind it.(If you really like horror stuff watch the Anime with headphones to increase the creepiness :D)', 'Corpse Party is an OVA adaptation of a video game with the same title.STORY:A story about a group of friends (and a teacher) stuck in a haunted school. First episode mainly involves Naomi & Seiko as they perform the usual horror shtick. They argue about something dumb, split up cause plot convenience and continue to make stupid mistake until something unfortunate happens. Episode 2-4 diverge from the first episode\'s structure by implementing mystery as the main driving force of the story. Though a decent mystery, it contains some irritating plot conveniences. (For example, having pages stuck until a certain ""convenient"" moment when the pages suddenly...becomes unstuck for no apparent reason.) Even with some plot convenience, the core of the mystery still remain understandable. Although I can\'t help but have a feeling that a lot of details were omitted. Not really a surprise since it\'s an adaptation of a game loaded with text. The story from episodes 2-4 tends to jump around various character to progress, and to it\'s credit, doing this actually helps character death remain unpredictable. The series ends with a cheap shock, it\'s done in bad taste and it sucked.CHARACTERS:Seiko - Mostly use as a plot device for Naomi\'s internal conflict. Her place within the conflict might be more believable if time is spent exploring her character. Instead we are left with vague characterization of her while wasting an episode applying cream on her ass. We never got to know much about her feelings for Naomi or her motivation for surviving.Naomi - The only character with a define character arc. Mostly dealing with her guilt from episode 1. She takes a backseat until the last two episode where her character arc starts. Her character arc is too short, with Naomi reaching a conclusion way sooner than expected. It didn\'t reach the potential it shows, mainly due to the lack of time dedicated to showing her struggles. She does have a unique conclusion which is quite refreshing.Satoshi - One of the two people who is in charge of progressing the mystery. There\'s not much about his character. Most drama centering around him is mainly about his sister Yuka. He is serviceable to the mystery. Though his desire to find his sister makes great tension for the story, but rather hard to stomach at times due to his stupidity.Yuka - Satoshi\'s sister. A plot device (an acceptable one) use for tension in episodes 2 & 3. Relationship between Satoshi & Yuka is well establish, well enough to understand Yuka\'s importance from Satoshi\'s perspective.Mayu - Her purpose is to die.Sakutaro - The story needed a psychotic guy to harm Yuka, so he fills the role. He had some interesting traits but remains ignored by the story, not giving him a chance to be more than a psychotic guy.Ayumi - The second person progressing the mystery. Unlike Satoshi, she has a clear personality, and more invested in the mystery. Her scenes are usually deeply involve with the mystery, any other establishment of her character is skimp quickly. She is still an acceptable character regardless.Kishinuma - Mostly tagging along Ayumi. He is just a helping hand in the early episodes. Though he gets his moments, he suffers the same problem as Naomi. The story didn\'t dedicate much time to him, leaving him with an anti-climatic character resolution.Yui-sensei - Her purpose is to die.Overall, characters aren\'t well handled. With such weak characters in a horror where people are constantly dying, they feel disposable to a certain extent. Relying on shock value can only make an audience feel startled and disgusted at best. The audience only have an emotional response (negative in this case) towards characters they care about. It gives value to a character death rather than feeling cheap. The lack of time is definitely to blame, four episodes clearly isn\'t enough to develop nine characters.VISUALS:Corpse party has generally pleasing backgrounds. Using traditional wood building aesthetics for the school. The use of underexpose lighting in contrast with the bright colors on important objects is quite effective in helping the scene to remain dark yet visible. However, the lack of variety is a problem. It\'s kinda boring to see the same hallway and classroom in almost every scene in the show. Character designs are good, with the exception of Satoshi and Kishinuma looking too similar to each other. It\'s hard to differentiate them. Their facial expression during intense moments are what sold the character designs for me. The animation is lackluster, but most shots focus on individual still composition rather than movement, so it won\'t be a huge bother. Though Corpse Party\'s cinematography might be a mix bag. This show loves dutch angles, may be a little too much. Some scene\'s pacing feel awkwardly dragged out. It may have been chosen to make the scene uneasy, but it comes off jarring rather than uneasy. Besides those complaints, I don\'t really have problem with anything else about the cinematography.SOUND:I don\'t really understand music much, but the OST is to my liking. The OST is also integrated to the show wonderfully, complimenting scenes greatly and not being overuse. The show while great with background music also understand the importance of quiet moments. Some scene are left with little sound to great effect especially for atmospheric reasons. Sound effects used mostly did their job. However, I feel more details should be added. For example, every foot steps sounds the same. No matter the position or material the characters step on. Sound mixing in some scenes from episode 1 needs adjustments. The OST and sound effects sometimes blend together, unable to hear some sound effect clearly. Voice acting is solid, maybe Satomi Arai could have been better. Her vocal performance sounds exactly like Shirai Kuroko, a little more subtle changes is appreciated.ENJOYMENT:Meh. 5/10OVERALL:Corpse Party is a horror with a somewhat decent story, but ultimately just another excuse for hyper gore. It is worth to watch if you want to see kids getting brutally murdered. I would not recommend this show for any other reasons.The game might be good. But that won\'t change my opinion on the anime. :P becomes unstuck for no apparent reason.) Even with some plot convenience, the core of the mystery still remain understandable.

But that won\'t change my opinion on the anime. :P', 'Ok just got back from finishing the game and decided to re-watch the anime after years from last seeing it and OH GOD!I actually thought this anime was really good when I originally saw it. Where did I go wrong. It literally took some plot points and pretty much every bad end in the game and shoved them together hoping for a good result.Seiko and Naomi who were my favourite characters were absolutely betrayed in this anime adaptation and all of their diologue and good moments were ruined with the super rushed nature of the anime. They even outright changed some of the scenes so...they wouldnt have to make more scenes to develop it like the game did. The emotional payoff that the game provided is completely gone in the anime. It felt like they entered Heavenly Host and left immedietly after. Probably because of it being only 4 episodes and the fact that I played the game very recently so it was like it was going super quickly.It was pretty insulting to see my favourite characters die just because the writers wanted to the be the edgiest they could. They basically dropped most of the mystery and story elements in favour of more blood and gore. They got some things right like a bit of Sachiko\'s story was told at least but only on the rare occasion did this happen. Honestly the entire anime felt like I was watching the game in 10 times the speed with chunks taken out for extra speedrun. Its just such a shame because with the right amount of time they could have easily adapted the game into anime form and done justice to the original story. They needed an absolute minimum of 12 episodes to pull this off. They were trying to shove a 15 hour long game into a 2 hour long OVA series. That fact alone tells you everything about this anime. Everything feels like you\'re constantly on the skip button so characters talk insanely quickly and events are just completely skipped when they just got started. It\'ll be like one moment ""Ok we\'ve finished the first one"" then one minute later its ""Ok we\'ve done the rest"" and completely skips the inbetween and the actual doing of the tasks. It really ruins all the story and effort put into the original as the game focused on slow build up and tense atmospheres. Both which are not present in the anime. Because its moving 10 times the speed it doesnt have the time or the care to build up a tense atmosphere for the horror it just wants to get to the deaths as quickly as possible without giving any context. I really dont know what they were trying to achieve with this anime adaptation. It pissed off the original fans of the game and it just gave the bad endings and deaths so it could become this meme for all those who say anime isnt for kids to use as evidence.The art style is fine and gets the job done. The expressions are one of the few things I can praise this series for if nothing else. They do give the sense of greif and misery.The voice acting is also good but they just managed to get their hands on the original cast for the game so not much to say on that front.I originally liked this anime when I first watched it but after playing the game and re-watching it I can clearly see they didnt care at all about telling an interesting story. They just wanted the biggest shock factor they could make out of this product.Overall if you havent played the game you probably wont mind the anime that much like I did at first but please to god do not re-watch it after finishing the game. Your experience will do a 180 very quickly and you\'ll quickly see how this could have been so much more.6/10 wouldnt recommend to people over the game.(Note: I originally gave it a 10 which is why its like that on my list as I dont like changing ratings after my first viewing, but I have no idea why I gave it such a rating in the first place.) they wouldnt have to make more scenes to develop it like the game did.

The only problem i had, was that there was not enough actual story shown. It decided that it was going to focus on all the guts and blood and creepy stuff instead of actually explaining what the hell was going on,...I found this disappointing.

Im not used to horror series being this detailed and disturbing (just how i like it :9) The serie intself is pretty recent so i guess it was to be expected. The only thing i didnt like is that everything ended with guts and the remains often seemed to kinda look the same no matter how they died.Sound: I personally likes the opening however i didn't think it suited the series very well. I was expecting something creepy and eerie...... and i didn't get that kinda feel from the opening. The music used to emphasize the thriller  moments however were great.Character: 7I kinda liked the characters. They all acted a lot more natural to someone in that situation, i mean if you just saw your best friend die in the most horrific way ever then your not exactly going to be chipper about it unless your mad....I loved that everyone reacted completely different to the situation they were in, this stopped it from being to repetitive.Enjoyment: 8I really love horror stories especially the kind with really deep storyline and even though this series storyline isn't the most complicated one it is completely shrouded in mystery and the characters have to put the puzzle pieces together themselves over time until you can see what's really going on.Overall: 7Great serie, awsome ending and amazing graphics planning to play the game soon I found this disappointing.

I can say this is defiantly one of the most disturbing things I have ever watched. It is very gory and the death scenes were very graphic and good animation. Even though it is disturbing to watch, it is a great short series to watch, especially if you love  horror and gore.What I liked about it was that it had great animation it was very smooth and the gore was very realistic, I had to cover my eyes during a few parts. Without the great animation it...defiantly wouldn't  have been as good. The characters and their diverse personalities defiantly added to the enjoyment of the series. Also the opening song is very nice and enjoyable to listen to, even though it seems a bit to happy for Corpse party.The things I didn't like about Corpse party was the length of it. I think it should have been made into a full series. It defiantly had potential to be something more with character back stories and developing the storyline and events further. The OVA is based on the psp game and there are 5 chapters , so the story gets crunched into only four episodes. Because of this I find that the story develops to quickly and it takes away from the fact they are trapped in a school with blood thirsty ghost and trying to keep themselves sane.Other then the fact that I found the story crunched and the potential of this discarded because it's not longer, there is nothing that I really dislike about it.

Because, if you are a hardcore horror fan like me, you are going to be SO disappointed if you read the reviews for this and see so many people deeming it ""best anime horror has to offer"", or, ""super scary."" The honest truth was... it just wasn\'t any of those things.Not to say it was necessarily BAD, but just if you go in to it immediately after reading other\'s thoughts on it (like I did) you WILL have heightened expectations and then...just be bummed when it... doesn\'t ever deliver.I watched it all in one afternoon. It was entertaining, and had a lot of entertaining gore. If you\'re a gore hound, or if you want to watch something about ghosts and don\'t mind a story with not a lot of meat to it, go for it! Just expect it\'s going to be a light, albeit gory, \'haunted house\' like ride and don\'t expect nothing more, RE: scares or surprising twists.To be honest, I really regret reading everyone else\'s reviews before I went in to this. I felt like I would have liked it a LOT more if my expectations weren\'t so heightened by them. OF COURSE, this is why I said this is directed at hardcore horror fans. Someone not in to the genre totally WILL find this scary and/or disturbing. But as someone that likes this genre, I just kind of... wasn\'t shocked (by neither the scares, gore, nor \'twist\' at the end.)But that\'s why I wanted to write this! As a \'reality check\' (or expectations check?) to anyone that loves horror, so they won\'t be disappointed like I was.As long as you don\'t have a lot of expectations going in, you will at least enjoy the ride, and it\'s a great afternoon waster at least. =)A final note: I feel like part of why it never delivered 100% for me, was it was just so condensed... when you take a whole game and smash it in to 4 episodes, you are going to naturally lose a lot of context regarding character development, atmosphere, etc, and it\'s going to not have a big impact. My honest impression of this anime after completion, is that it was OK but that I am now really interested in playing the game (or at least watching playthroughs) in the future. Honestly, there were so many scenes were I felt like I would have been more upset had I had more context. Especially regarding character deaths. I just constantly felt like I was on the VERGE of feeling something for the plot and characters, but never actually felt myself go over that final edge to finally being INVESTED.

And I think the thing holding me back was probably details and context left out.', ""This anime would be okay for anybody that enjoys a gore saw-like story. The storyline for the anime was absolutely dreadful, there were too many plot-holes, and although the story was understandable it would just jump from one scene and skip a lot of necessary information.The art however, fit the horror theme with dark and dreary lighting throughout the series. The art is something that this show could be commended on.The music and sound effects for the show fit the mood and make the show more suspenseful and creepy. The voice acting however, varied with some parts being very convincing while others were just mediocre.Character...development could have been better, if the writers had made the story go more in depth with the characters  it may have been possible to get more of an attachment to them.The show however is entertaining and may be a decent watch if you aren't expecting too much when going into it. The show is of course gory, and the sound effects for the gore are occasionally cringe worthy.Overall the series was sub-par, but considering it was only 4 episodes, that could be expected. I dont particularly recommend the series, but I wouldn't stop anybody who would want to see it. development could have been better, if the writers had made the story go more in depth with the characters  it may have been possible to get more of an attachment to them.The show however is entertaining and may be a decent watch if you aren't expecting too much when going into it.

I\'m going to do my best to avoid spoilers but if any crop up in my review, I will surround them in asterisks *like so*.So this is an adaptation of a visual novel- not a new concept on the anime scene at all. That makes it a shame that this adaptation was executed so poorly when it could have been much, much more.I think the absolute biggest flaw with this show is its length. 4 episodes. 4 episodes to get through the entire plot of a visual novel. Because of this...single issue, almost every other aspect of the show immediately plummets in quality.Was this meant to merely be a promo for the game? If so, then it should have been a single episode teaser similar to Persona 5: The Daybreakers. If the intent was to convey the whole plot, then allowing it to manifest as only 4 episodes was shooting the project in the kneecaps before it was even released.Story: 4This is what happens when you try to cram the plot of a visual novel with 9 primary characters into 4 episodes. You do the math. The story feels disjointed at many points simply because they have to jump from one plot point to the next, like a checklist to get through before the series is over. The actual premise of the series is great and the concepts are all there, but the execution of the story is decent at best.Art: 6Not much to say; it\'s an early 2000s anime and given the era it\'s from, the art looks pretty good. The gore gives you plenty to look at, and although gore can\'t be described as ""pleasant"" to look at, it\'s drawn in a way that\'s at least compelling to see and creates a reaction from the viewer.Sound: 8Just about the only thing the series\' length didn\'t ruin is the sound. The soundtrack is effective in setting the mood and does it duty well in making the viewer tense at all the right moments, as well as building up to impactful moments.Character: 3I bet you can tell what my critique on the characters is going to be, right? Here\'s the thing: you can\'t establish a group of 9 friends in 4 episodes. We learn very little about anyone making it hard to care for these people or care about what\'s happening to them. Their personalities are incredibly vague and at some points nonexistent. I JUST finished watching it and I can name maybe 3 of the people in the main friend group, and 1 other character outside of the friend group. *Some of them die just about as quickly as they\'re introduced, making it even more tedious to try and care or keep up.* A competent show will usually dedicate at least one episode to each main character to give them a moment to flesh them out, or at least an arc that they play a prominent role in. I honestly believe not a single character in this show gets a full arc or any semblance of realization to them. I don\'t feel like any of the characters experience any form of growth throughout the show, and some are shown to be downright deplorable and unlikable for no reason (or at least with no context since we\'re told nothing about these people). I found myself confusing many of the characters for one another for about half of the series because of how they bleed together. Goodness gracious, it\'s a mess.Enjoyment: 5The premise and concepts were gripping and compelling. I was interested in the story and I thought many aspects were clever. However, the abysmal execution of these concepts made me annoyed throughout the show, wishing it had been done better. My enjoyment was hindered by irritation and I finished the show feeling peeved, not satisfied.Overall: 5I think I\'m going to buy the visual novel when I get a chance to because I\'d love to experience this story in a medium where it is able to be executed with quality and where it is given the space to flesh out its ideas. If you\'re at all curious in the premise, just skip the anime and try out the visual novel.

This was a waste of my time. I've watched hundreds of horror/suspense movies and anime. This was without a doubt one of the dumbest things I've watched.First off, You should watch Corpse Party: Missing Footage, That adds about 1 minute of backstory and 10 minutes of grunting, screaming, crying and brutal gore.There really is little plot in this, I feel it could have been solved out in 2 episodes lasting 20 minutes each if that. It is interesting to see what happened, however, they never fully tell you why. You learn little bits and pieces and you need to put them together...to figure it out.Honestly if you want to waste 2 hours watching people get gored that's your business. I do not think this anime deserves this high of a score. writing more of a review on this is rather impossible because there is nothing, nothing you can critique more. Enjoy~ to figure it out.Honestly if you want to waste 2 hours watching people get gored that's your business.

Enjoy~"", ""Corpse Party was an OVA I discovered randomly looking through an anime database. I didn't hold much expectations about it, all I knew was what I had been told by friends before. This OVA being based on a game, and I had to watch out for extreme gore... I do also admit that I'm usually not a fan of gory animes and movies.. However, this anime made it onto my list of exceptions.. I will be writing a spoilerless review about Corpse Party..Mayu Suzumoto is a girl popular and much loved by her classmates aswell as teachers. However something has come up with her family,...and they have to move away.. Not wanting to lose the friendships she has made in her current school, her occult loving classmate Ayumi discovers a ritual online she figures the friends can hold to bid Mayu a last farewell and keep a part of her with them forever... they hold the ritual being called ''Sachiko Ever After'' but this is gonna turn out to be an event everyone will regret. Holding the ritual threw them into an alternate dimension.. a place that looks much like the very much knowledged school horror story from Kisaragi Gakuen being their current school.. This school was torn down and Kisaragi was built over it as lots of troubling events happened here in the past. Several children went missing to be discovered dead. To make matters worse, this place where the friends are stuck, being the much talked about torn down elementary school.. Heavenly Host seem to be unlike other elementary schools in many ways... Before they know it... The friends are gonna be fighting to stay alive, aswell as searching for a way home in a place where going back home seems impossible.. Friendships, kindness and Human survivial are tested at several ways in the OVA animation of corpse party.. Its a must watch.. its emotional, I admit I was crying at a point in the anime, it has the horror element, but its also extremely gory so please keep this in mind upon watching the anime.It has a good storyline.. but for those who played the original corpse party.. the anime is slightly modified in the OVA as compared to the games.. they made some major changes, the anime isn't entirely the same as the original adaptions... They also had to cut out on a couple of the events in the anime as compared to the real story of Corpse Party.... The story skipped a bit in this OVA, in overall making it seem a bit lacking. However, its only a four episodes anime, so including all keyfacts and events from the original story wouldn't be possible.. But its still a good animation that does the original games some justice... The OST was pretty good.. the background music and opening songs.. I have nothing to complain about here...While the anime in overall has a few openings here and there.. and as it skips a bit between the events, Nothing would be better than to see the real story unfold infront of your eyes during the gameplay.. Reading upon the original story would also do you well.. it wasn't a short game.... the original story of corpse party wouldn't do well without in the least 22 episodes of storyline, and overall developments.....Watch Corpse Party...

There is definitely no story in this anime, Everything is so rushed and it left many unsolved questions in the anime. So do not watch this anime if you want a good plot and story.Character (5/10)There is seriously no character development in this series. But the...character design were solid. That's what saved it from getting a low rating.Sound (8/10)I like the opening song of this anime. The BGM were also handled very well, It changes according to the atmosphere, I like it.Art (8/10)The designs in this anime is very solid. It isn't very bad, But the gore in this anime is very disturbing, but I am not very concerned about that.Enjoyment (3/10)Overall this show was not very enjoyable, There is many gore in it and it was very disturbing, The story was also very boring, So I definitely not recommend you to watch this anime.Overall (6/10) character design were solid.

Said -verse is only made up of an old school and the corpses/ghosts of other dead people that came before them. As the cast member slowly die off they try to come back to the real world....Lots of death and force tragedy happens.I kid you not, this is the majority of this little four episode OVA. The actual game has considerably more story, and story-wise, this OVA is an insult to that game.Art: 7/10Not particularly memorable, not particularly bad either. It was good enough to mess me up the first time watching it. So at least it did that well.Sound: 9/10Yeah, this was actually the best part of the anime. The music, opening, and ending themes were all really good. The voice work was spot on. The sound effects were bone-chillingly great.Character: 3/10Characterization? Oh yeah, that feature that makes a person in a show memorable. This little thing has none of it. Sorry, but the only characters that had an interesting dynamic played their part out in the first episode. Seiko was the most interesting girl, and even then I say that with a bit of hesitance. Even when a few characters descend into insanity, it is not memorable.Enjoyment: 2/10I guess if you like pointless gore and murder for the sake of gore and murder, here you go. For horror? Not quite, as this never pulls off a good scare (But the atmosphere is marvelous!). The use of fanservice was squicky and plain weird in placement, usually put during or just before a shot of severe death (Because we want to see the panties of an underage girl just seconds before she is slammed into a wall in a way that would make the late Dale Earnhardt cringe). I can't even think of a term to use for this section of the review.Overall: 4/10I'm still not even sure what to say about this. I waited months to actually post this review, and I still feel unsure about it. This isn't something I could recommend, mainly because it fails interestingly at appealing to any demographic.All in all, this little four episode ova is a disappointing waste of time.

This is my first review, so let me explain my ratings: Depending on the nature of the anime, different categories are weighted differently. Look to the bottom of my review for the overall score that I give if you don't want to bother with the long review.I only give a critical rating. My personal rating might be different, but for the purposes of getting my point across, it is a critique.Without further ado, let's get this review started!Story - 5 (30%): The actual story has a great theme to it. The revolved around the supernatural occurrence of the occult that Shinozaki Ayumi brought...upon the group of students that stayed behind one night. The actual execution of the theme explored, however, was not so great.The unfortunate fact that the anime ran for only 4 episodes meant that certain plot points such as character backgrounds and monologues found in the original source material were not properly explored or were non-existent which were vital to the story itself.So, as for rating this category, the story aspect of this anime receives an average score of “5”; the story was not bad, but it was not good either, thus an average rating of 5 I believe is appropriate.Character Development - 3 (30%): As stated in the story category, characters were not developed as much as the original source material. This is due to the fact that motivations and thought processes were seemingly all over the place as backgrounds and monologues were not properly explored or were not explored at all.Characters, such as Yuka, had dedicated scenes to their character development as events unfold around them over time. These characters are not plenty in number, but does provide reasons to the way they acted and why they were motivated to perform certain actions. However, main characters such as Naomi or Ayumi were not fully developed as much as Yuka. Thus, this fact significantly hurts the progression of the story.So, for the rating of this category, the character development aspect of this anime receives an unfortunate “3”; the main characters did not receive the spotlight they needed while the less important side characters received the development that the main characters needed the most.Plot Progression/Pacing - 2 (25%): This is where the anime suffered the most. Because the anime lasted for only 4 episodes, the story seemed to progress too quickly for the number of characters that were introduced.Important points, such as the child spirits and Sachiko’s development towards the end, were not explored to the extent that the original source material had done. This hindered both character development AND story development and thus, hindered the pacing as well. The story seemed to be all over the place as characters were killed off seemingly without reason.So, as for rating this category, the story aspect of this anime receives a poor score of “2”; it could be worse, but the pacing was so disorienting that a rating of 2, I believe, is appropriate.Representation/presentation of the genres and tropes provided and explored - 7 (10%): This category is were the anime shined the most. Some of the scenes depicting tragedy and horror were done exceptionally well, such as the flashback scene where the child spirit with a missing eye placed her memories within Ayumi’s mind. The way the flashback was delivered was well done as it really showed the horror of the scene through imagery and, most importantly, sound.Even though these were done well, certain scenes seemed to happen without necessity, harking back to the fact that characters died almost without reason. Scenes depicting these “random” deaths were too bloody and gory to have much impact on the gravity of the situation just to add shock value when the situation did not call for it.So, for the rating of this category, the representation of the horror aspect of this anime receives a generous score of “7”; even though the random deaths had shock value when they didn’t need it, the scenes where it did have an impact were done pretty well.Popularity and relevance towards the time period it was made in/made for - 3 (5%): This anime wasn’t particularly popular when it came out. Although the original source material gained quite a strong backing from fans alike, the OVA series did not seem to resonate well with dedicated fans to the series for a lot of the reasons made above.If the anime ran for at least 12 or 13 episodes, it could have been a much better experience as the anime would most likely have enough time to really delve deep into character backgrounds and really give sound explanations for why these events are unfolding and how the conflicts could be solved.So, as for rating this category, the relevancy and popularity aspects of this anime receive a low score of “3”; it suffered for its rushed pacing and bad execution of the true ending to the original source material.TL;DROverall Rating: 4(5 * 0.3) + (3 * 0.3) + (2 * 0.25) + (7 * 0.1) + (3 + 0.05) = CR1.5 + 0.9 + 0.5 + 0.7 + 0.015 = 3.6153.615 → 4Thank you for reading!

Have a nice day"", 'Alright this is the first time im doing a review so yeah .Basically , i though i was gonna expect a somewhat similar story to the Video Game/Visual Novel of the Series . So when i watched it . Hell i thought it was gonna be scary as fuck . Yeah , it was scary but not really what i expect it to be.Story: 6/10Yeah the story was apparently similar to the games (Obviously) but there were some twists which i find it either nice or bad. But , I was disappointed as they never showed some important parts from the original story...(The Games itself) which caused it to be fast-paced. And number of death scenes were lot . Basically a slaughterhouse show. So the Story is much more understandable if you ever played the gamesArt:8/10Alright i personally loved the Art , Especially loved the gore in it and i was pleased to see it was Uncensored . hey you dont get one of those every now and then. Animation was pretty well done. All that blood and gore.Sound: 7/10The voice acting was fairly done . Though some parts need to be improved at .

And it entertained me every time. Though the way they ended it of wasn't very good. It was depressing as hell and I had the feeling that there'd be a happy ending but no, I don't usually like sad and depressing endings to story's but the story was so good I can't hate it. I still hate that damn ending though "", ""So I decided to write a rather quick review for Corpse Party: Tortured Souls since I like Corpse Party and decided to waste my time.First things first, you must have played at least the original game for the PC or the definitive PSP remake, Corpse Party: Blood Covered to get some enjoyment out of it. (Go buy it on PSN if you're curious, support the localized release!) If you haven't done so, you would probably end up watching confused without any attachment to the characters whatsoever due to it's incredibly fast pacing. After all, they are cramming an 8-10 hour game into 4 episodes....The story is practically the same as the games and the first episode was pretty faithful to the first chapter aside from the ludicrously fast pacing. However, from episode two, a lot of significant changes were made to fit the story. The changes really bothered me, but that might just be me nitpicking. As a standalone anime, most of it would be somewhat incoherent as they skip a lot of major defining scenes from the game.Now the art and animation is really good. Highly faithful to the PSP version's artstyle. Just a word of warning: this anime is incredibly gory and not for the faint of heart. There's no censorship whatsoever and they went all out with the bloody details from the splattering viscera to the gouged out eyeballs. The game wasn't nearly as violent as this (sans the descriptions best left to the mind). There are a few herps and derps here and there, but really no animation studio is perfect.Voice acting is top notch and they got the voice actors from the PSP game to voice their respective characters. For the music, Mages practically just took the soundtrack from the game and slapped it on. No complaints here since I really enjoy Corpse Party's music. The squishy noises are quite good too despite how gross it sounds.Character development is what this adaptation completely lacking. If someone watched this without having first played the game, there's absolutely no attachment to any of the characters whatsoever. The pacing is what kills it. Many defining scenes from the game were cut off for the sake of time. I'd rather not go into detail because of spoilers, but I'm rather sure that someone who has played the game would know.Overall, I enjoyed this OVA as a Corpse Party fan. I like to think of it as one of the non-canonical alternate endings to Corpse Party, much akin to Corpse Party: Book of Shadows. That ending seriously just blew my mind. Still, I was a little disappointed with it. I felt it was basically just gore porn. I give it a 7/10.If I watched this as a standalone anime I'd probably give it a 5/10.

A group of student hear a rumer that an abandonded school building is haunted and decide to go and see if it actually is, and yup you guessed it, it actually is.  The students then get trapped inside and sepperated.  They then try to find a way to find the other...members of the group and to simply make it out of the building alive, o yeah the spirits that haunt this building are out for blood, and lots of it.Art- 8The art of the series is pretty well done and one of the best parts of the animation in my opinion is the lighting.  With how the darkness leaves you with an uneasy fealing and wondering what is around the next corner.Sound- 7The sound of the series went hand in hand with what was going on at any given time.  When someone was going through something that they really would not likeke to the bodily sound of what was happening just made the scene even more realistic and almost kind of personal, like you felt bad for the characters with what they afe going through.Characters- 5Speaking of characters they were grey and storyless.

Had enough of an initial hook to draw me in, and the plot arcs they managed to fit in were all the best.My only complaint is that there were a few too many ecchi/comedy moments for such a dark genre that made the mood confusing to follow and broke a bit of the immersion factor.All in all though, they did a great job when drawing up and animating! The graphics were mesmerizing! A++ ', ""CP:TS was outstanding. I loved everything from the gore to the art. It was absolutely gorgeous. I'm a freak for gore. I loved seeing all of it and flinching wasnt even in the question. I give this anime 10/10 from the story to the characters to the music and not to mention the HUGE plot twist. It blew my mind. It wasnt at all like the manga. But I still cant decide if i liked the plot twist or not. Over all I give this anime a perfect score and I'm pissed that its probably the shortest anime that I've ever seen. "", ""*Keep in mind, I've never played the game(s) before and this is solely based on the anime itself*   Now, to the review.Easily the Goriest bit of anime that I have ever seen.Normally, I can handle gore pretty well, but this show just made my blood run cold. Very detailed and graphic in all of the deaths.Anyway, Positives: Creepy atmosphere, gruesome deaths, gore, gore, did I mention gore, and also, gore. This show also had one of my favorite voice acting performances I've heard in a while: The voice of Sachiko Shinozaki, done by Ikue Ootani. Just beautifully done in my opinion.Negatives: Basic...story that I didn't really care about and you never really build attachments to any of the characters. other than that, nothing stood out to me as negative.Overall: Extremely graphic, but highly interesting.

It disturbed me more than some of the freakier hentai I\'ve seen even, which isn\'t much, granted, but it was enough to scar me for life, and that should really say something about Corpse Party.If you\'re a fan of Game of Thrones, Saw, and Horror in general, you will love this series, and you\'ll hate yourself for watching it afterwards.  Without giving too much story away, let\'s just say that no one...is safe, NO ONE, and you will see a lot of highly detailed gore, murder, blood and in general supernatural shenanigans.Quick breakdown of the anime in general:Story:The story is about a group of friends that are about to be split up by one of them going to a different school, so they preform a charm that will keep them together which involves tearing apart a paper doll and keeping the pieces.  After performing the charm, though, they\'re plunged into a hellish older version of their school populated mostly by the ghosts of children and a serial killer who killed them.  The story is very hard to predict and manages to send a lot of twists your way in just 4 episodes.  The show also has a Game of Thrones style attitude toward killing off its characters, so don\'t pick any favorites unless you want to get your heart broken.Art:The art in Corpse Party is actually pretty amazing.  A horror series like this needs to create a certain type of ambiance, and Corpse Party pulls off the dark, hellish atmosphere of the ghost school quite magnificently.  I should also point out that the gore, though very unpleasant to look at, is also rendered in a much higher detail than I usually see, and other effects, such as the creeping darkness, or the ubiquitous bloodstains, are very well done and all come together to create an excellent sinister atmosphere.Sound isn\'t my forte so I won\'t rate it (though I may in other series if it\'s particularly bad)Enjoyment:Wow, I don\'t know if ""enjoy"" is the right word for this series.  Does anyone enjoy a Dali painting?  No.  Can someone appreciate the artistic skill and creativity that went into it?  Yes, yes they can.  I mean, obviously if I\'m giving the series high ratings, I must have enjoyed it, right?  Even a few months after I saw it I\'m still not sure if I actually LIKED it, but it did leave an impact on me, and it\'s definitely a well made series.Overall:If you like animes with adorable little girls, terrifying little girls, tons of gore, and just horror in general, then you will ""like"" Corpse Party. is safe, NO ONE, and you will see a lot of highly detailed gore, murder, blood and in general supernatural shenanigans.Quick breakdown of the anime in general:Story:The story is about a group of friends that are about to be split up by one of them going to a different school, so they preform a charm that will keep them together which involves tearing apart a paper doll and keeping the pieces.

Sometimes, the faces can look a bit weird sometimes, but the detailed shots of the school compensate for that. It also looks cute, which can be very misleading, and in my opinion, misleading artstyles make a horror anime more exciting, because you wouldn't expect something bad to happen to cute characters.The characters have stereotypes,...like the little sister, or the overly happy highschool girl, but it influenced the way they reacted well enough that they were all unique in their own way.I really enjoyed the anime, despite it being so short, because the scenes are well made and there is quite a bit of character development.

The OP is great, catchy and actually pretty beautiful, and captures the creepy and chaotic nature of the show perfectly.2. The animation and art is solid.3. The voice acting is great and the VAs really managed some spine-chilling screams.4. This is a plus for...me personally- the gore was seriously brutal and shocking and left me feeling queasy and amazed at the brutality, which is perfect for a horror anime.But that is pretty much it for the good, now we have the bad- (also SPOILERS beyond this point)1. Rushed plot: The original games took time to explain the lore of Heavenly Host much more clearly. The struggle to escape the school also seemed much more drawn out and difficult in the game, whereas in the anime, most of the exploits were actually off screen and implied, making it seem like a joke to escape the school. Four twenty minute episodes was by far not enough to properly set up and execute this story, and the ending was also pretty confusing at first glance. The lack of choice elements and interactivity the games has also in my opinion make this iteration inferior to the games.2. Whilst the gore was handled well, something never shown as much in the games, this anime isn\'t particularly scary. The jump-scares were not really quick and shocking enough to make me jump, and half the time it was not even clear what the threat to the students was, diminishing tension.3. Characters had little development and inter-character relationships. So many of the deaths, whilst shocking, I was not particularly moved by.It may seem like in terms of numbers here, the positives outweigh the negatives, but in reality this anime is not that good. The plot is too weak and rushed and the characters paper thin, with horror elements lacking. I would recommend just playing the game instead (although not the one available on steam, which seems to have really weird character redesigns that don\'t look good- if you have a PSP or 3DS, go for that instead. Otherwise the Steam version is ok apart from the worse art style)If you have not played the game, this will just confuse you. If you have played the game, it will likely disappoint you. But I won\'t say not to watch it, if you want a short and gory horror anime, this may be what you are looking for, just don\'t expect the plot to be too deep- this is essentially just ""Saw- the anime"", it is gore pr0n is what I am saying. me personally- the gore was seriously brutal and shocking and left me feeling queasy and amazed at the brutality, which is perfect for a horror anime.But that is pretty much it for the good, now we have the bad- (also SPOILERS beyond this point)1.

For the most part, however, the horrors revealed themselves at an engaging pace and the story had enough layers to fill all four episodes.The characters are no more interesting than perfectly average, generic anime high schoolers; the horror genre does lend itself to shallow personalities more often than not, and in some ways the focus on the narrative/horror elements worked to Corpse Party\'s advantage.  Without anyone to care about and be invested in, however, the show\'s potential to be truly disturbing has nowhere to take root.  I cheered for the kawaii imouto and her reliable onii-chan out of a sense of obligation, and Eri Kitamura\'s performance contributed strongly.  Otherwise, they were faceless wretches, and while a strong cast of characters is obviously not a prerequisite for a good horror film/series - sometimes it\'s even frowned upon - I came to Corpse Party shortly after finishing the first season of Higurashi.  The dichotomy illustrates how important character development and audience investment are to the successful integration of violence/gore/""bad ends.""  Maybe Higurashi isn\'t quite as explicit or unadorned in its depiction of bloody violence (though not by much), but every thrust of a knife delivers much greater impact due to the web of plotlines and character depth on the receiving end.  Corpse Party is full of recipients and victims, but very few actors who give the torture meaning.I bring this up because Corpse Party has a strong reputation for being disturbing and ill-suited for the weak of heart.  The show is full of blood and gore, to be sure, but unless you are the type of viewer who is easily put off by rather conventionally animated intestines and eye-stabbing, any deeper unsettlement will pass right by.  I guess I should have expected something this straightforward from something called “Corpse Party,” and I shouldn’t complain since I did get the bloody horror anime I wanted.  Without sufficiently engaging characters and with a tale that sometimes feels thin, though, the series leans heavily on the brutality for its success, and the art isn’t terribly appealing.  The character designs are fairly bland and the style not especially pleasing to look at; it makes me wonder if the eyeballs would have popped more in a live-action adaptation.Corpse Party does have its failings, and however much onscreen killing there might be, I wouldn’t call it a masterpiece of horror anytime soon.  It is good fun, though, and short enough to take in quickly, so I would certainly recommend it to most horror fans. that was somehow unsatisfactory.

Story - 7 | Art - 8 | Sound - 9 | Character - 9 | Enjoyment - 9 |  Wow!! I really liked this anime, because how well thought it is! If you like gore (blood and cute characters) then you should watch Corpse Party. !Warning! This anime can make you crazy! This series is very good for people who likes lots of blood and watch people suffering. It really surprised me! It all starts with classmates that are very friendly and decided to do a charm to be together forever - even is death - but it...went wrong and they went to an horrefying elementary school. I was sad when I found out that this anime only had 4 episodes. And that is really a shame, because it was so good. Compared to the original game and the manga based on the game, the anime is so small. It miss out so good moments and deaths, I think that the manga Corpse Party:Blood Covered looks much more like the original game. So the anime missed a lot and isn't truly like the original story. Aside that, it has a good animation with gross things and it's really scary. The only bad part is the moments that it left behind, that's why I rated 7 on the story. The deaths are awesome and the ending is amazing, but it makes you think about it. Hope you like! went wrong and they went to an horrefying elementary school.

I got sad when someone I liked in the series, well, passes away.Overall, I give it a 10/10, people may disagree, but I sure love it. :D Now, the story is meh, not bad, not good, but I still like it.Art is amazing, the guts, the blood, the backdrops, everything is spot onThe sound is also yet amazing, blades chopping heads, the cracking of floor boards, the voice actors, the Yandere style voice they have, it's also very good.I gave the character a score of 9, I gave it this score because in the moment, they were nice characters, while they lasted.

As I have played the original game it was adapted from I went into it with great expectations, possibly too high.I can honestly say, if I had gone into it without playing the game first and therefore having previous knowledge of the story, I would have most likely gotten lost as it missed out large chunks of information that gave answers to the backstory. Because of this, and mainly this I was disappointed with the outcome.However saying all this, if you are one who doesn't mind having a...few questions left unanswered, and you like harrowing stories of murder, insanity and gore corpse party is a gripping anime that is a reasonable way to spend your time. few questions left unanswered, and you like harrowing stories of murder, insanity and gore corpse party is a gripping anime that is a reasonable way to spend your time."", 'Oh boy, this anime brings back memories.If you\'ve heard of this anime, you must have heard of its gore.This anime is notorious for its gore.So, how do you think a 12-year old girl like me could find this? Well, lemme give you the short story.This anime is originally based of of the games, which are a mix of rpg-horror and visual novel, especially for the later games. And well, I was watching PewDiePie one late night, summer vacation.He was playing one of the corpse party games, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows.Now I actually ended up watching this anime when I was 10, NOT A GOOD...IDEA.Now, Pewds was trying to make a decision on trying to save this girl that was bound up.She was bandaged and tied by ropes, if the character (Aka Pewds) made the wrong move, a giant bucket of nails and screws would fall on the poor girl\'s face.Of course, Pewds does it incorrectly. I am then treated to some lovely writing describing how the bucket smashed the girl\'s face and how screws and nails pierced through her mouth and stuck out of her cheeks. Scarred for life.This effected me very emotionally, when it shouldn\'t have really, but since I was ten it made sense.(By the way, the games go far deeper than the anime does, so thankfully you won\'t see a girl\'s face get smashed with a bucket of nails and screws,YOU\'LL SEE MUCH WORSE.Anyway, dumb ol me, a couple months later, still being haunted by that experience, my intelligent brain decides to watch the anime because apparently that will make you face your fears.ANOTHER BIG MISTAKE.Scarred even more, then a year later, I show it to my best friend and scar her for life, my friend has seen to much gore anime, Blood C doesn\'t even faze her, I\'M SORRY BFF!Anyway...yeah that was the short version, but now you have a grasp of my situation, I am actually writing this review 2 years after I watched this anime, but do not worry, it\'s fresh in my mind and it will haunt me forever.So Corpse Party is shocking to pretty much anyone who would watch it, and life-scarring to any stupid 10 year old that would watch it too. People often hate on this anime for it\'s bad development, and that the only horror it has is gore, but you have to say, for 4 episodes and an OVA, this anime is not forgotten easily.Even my current self, I cringe every time I hear Corpse Party because of this anime, but I am also very intrigued. I would just be chilling in the local Game Stop when I hear on the monitors that they are making a remastered Corpse Party game for the 3Ds, I internally scream.I ""hate"" Corpse Party for what it is, I have no idea who the hell would come up with something so messed up, BUT I WANT TO BUY THAT 3DS GAME! Its pretty much a love-hate for me.You have to watch it to see for yourself, you know my experience, go make yours, so you can brag about it with your friends.Thanks for reading!

Now I am not one who usually writes reviews, but since this seems to usually get poor reviews I felt like putting in my relatively short 2 cents in. Here we go:Okay, so first of all I wouldn't consider Corpse Party to be scary, but instead I would consider this more to be a gore intensive horror, and boy do they not hold back. This has probably been the most disturbing anime's that I have ever seen, with each episode filled with detailed and bloody gore all throughout, and so I must warn it is...not for the weak stomached.In regards to plot, I would say that it may be lacking a tad bit more than I would have liked, however I would be confident in saying that this was most likely due to there being only 4 episodes. Now I have not played the game but I have heard that the OVA series skipped over much of it, and if there had been more episodes we would have likely been able to see more character and plot development. What I was impressed by was the ability of the writers to create mystery with some twists with such a short series. They slowly start to give you bits and pieces and at the very end is where you finally understand, which keeps you intrigued and interested throughout the entire series.One thing I would like to mention is regarding character choices. I have heard many people complain that the characters are stupid as they would make stupid decisions many, many times. Now I do agree in some cases however I would just like to point out that it may be a choice that someone would make when they are scared, emotionally unstable, and in that situation. I think this is something to think about when watching the anime.Overall i really enjoyed this anime and think that for people who enjoy gore and a little mystery is a must watch, So don't let the poor MAL score deter you! not for the weak stomached.In regards to plot, I would say that it may be lacking a tad bit more than I would have liked, however I would be confident in saying that this was most likely due to there being only 4 episodes.

The end is very good, but I felt that something was missing. The...characters were incredibly well built, they look like they are real.

Let me start off by saying though, the overall concept and the sound design are MAGNIFICENT. I mean really... that music and sound effects were easily the most impressive and eeriest part of this whole anime. I loved the energy and the no holding-back of it all. This show is ROUGH, I mean the bloodiest/goriest anime I\'ve seen yet. And I love that. The only reason I really don\'t give this anime a perfect score is the character writing aspect of it. Maybe because it\'s so short, so they had to rush into things more, I\'m...not sure. But we learn a whole lot about the school and environment they are in, but absolutely nothing about the initial 9 characters who are experiencing the entire thing. When they are killed off, it\'s scary and horrifying but not really...sad? They appear to be likable characters, we just know so little about them, therefore it keeps us at a distance. I personally love anime best when I feel completely sucked in and almost hypnotized by what\'s going on. I didn\'t get that here, because I had no personal connection to any of these characters whatsoever, and that makes a big difference. It didn\'t give us enough time to make any relation to the 9, really all we knew about them is that they were best friends. That\'s all, and while it\'s sweet and enough to get a story started, it wasn\'t enough to finish it. Though the ending was also INCREDIBLE. I was worried for a moment towards the end, because it almost begins to feel a bit cheesy when they (really trying not to spoil) free the evil spirit, but then we still end with a big, bloody BANG. And it was superb.ADDITION: if you haven\'t watched the series yet, I highly recommend watching the 11 minute ""Missing Footage"" OVA first, it doesn\'t solve all the problems listed above, but certainly does help with that lack of character development I was talking about.

The art is fairly good but at times, it appears to show that the human body is only made up of guts. The soundtrack is amazing and sets up the mood to the quick paced, action filled mystery horror Corpse party is. The characters are below average in terms of common sense, and have sub par human intelligence, especially Satoshi who would leave his sister with a complete stranger and go inside a haunted building rather than stay outside to wait with her....The plot though flawed with apparent loopholes is rather good with twists and turns right up until the last episode, though it doesn't really allow us to take in the story with the little screen time it has. But at times, we have to ignore the fact that even by going by the anime's own rules, it fails to explain certain things, like the re entrance of Kishinuma at the right time and place. Overall Corpse Party minding that the characters lack common sense, its a must watch for those with a fetish for blood, gore and cheap thrills.

Not only will it give you a slightly altered outcome, it'll scare you a heck of a lot more (which I assume is what you want if you're fishing in the horror genre).The anime itself is fine, but it's honestly...really cool to know about the RPG before watching the anime. As I said, though, the anime is good. I like to recommend rainy day anime to watch, and this is definitely one of them. Better yet: a rainy night. I'd say the voice acting is one of the better things about this anime. The screams that come out of it are nightmare inducing. Other than that, the story is awesome, although you get more of it through playing the actual game.

Emulate the PSP port or buy the 2008 PC port on Steam. This OVA is not worth your time.This ""adaptation"" rushes through the entire game\'s plot just to get straight to the gore and boob-groping fanservice (some of which isn\'t even in the games?), completely taking out all development the characters go through, blurring their connections with each other, and taking away from any actual artistic merit or message the games...have. Corpse Party has a very hopeful message and a very strong theme of friendship and this OVA has none of that.It was already pretty distressing that they extended the prologue to take up half the first episode, just to shorten the entire actual first chapter (which is already the shortest chapter in the game, frankly; but in the game, it is still longer than the prologue. Which is not the case here.) into a rushed mess with none of the development from the game that made me care about any of the characters, all because they just wanted to get into the eroguro (which I\'m sure is where most their budget went, because the animation is fucking ugly as sin) and poorly animated lesbian boob-groping; however, the next 3 episodes rush through the series in even more infuriating ways that I genuinely do not have the patience to get into.The soundtrack is pretty good, but that\'s solely because a good amount of it is taken straight from the games.

It was dark. It was visceral. It was overall a bloody good time.While the imagery itself is sometimes gruesome, the sound design is what really makes it cringeworthy. All of the squishing, all of the crunching, all of the screaming, it’s nicely concocted over top of an eerie-sounding ambiance.Ultimately, Bougyakusareta Tamashii no Jukyou isn’t a great series, but it delivers a type of horror we don’t often see in the west, and...it does so in a way that makes just enough sense to keep you engaged throughout.For that, it earns a solid 7/10 it does so in a way that makes just enough sense to keep you engaged throughout.For that, it earns a solid 7/10', ""Let me set the record straight before I dive into this nonsensical garbage, the reason I so thoroughly dislike this is not due to the gore present, in fact this is nowhere near as gory as many awful edgy 80's OVA's were. Second I did not play any of the terrible looking games, that look like any other cheaply made RPG maker games that flood the indie Anime game market. Regardless, an Anime should be judged on its own merits as a standalone product, if you need millions of gaps to be filled in by an entirely different product that is not the answer and...should never be promoted or accepted.So, the basic premise is that these cardboard characters are at their school late at night, doing some sort of farewell party for one of their friends, one character gets the idea to perform some stupid ritual, after this, shit hits the fan and now they are in a haunted Elementary school in some other dimension or some utter bullshit, and basically they have to survive all the threats they face, while attempting to maintain their sanity in the process. Oh yeah, there is also some crappy mystery they have to solve while they are there in order to get out.This all sounds nice and dandy, until you are hit with the sudden realization that these characters as a collective have the intelligence of a half-eaten potato. The sheer mental retardation on display is so utterly breathtaking that I stopped the Anime at various points to ponder if whoever wrote this truly understood what they were making their characters do. If I had to take a wild stab in the dark, whoever wrote this had an idea for how these characters were going to meet their demise, they were so focused on that aspect, and since they also cannot write for shit, forgot the very important part of, well how do the characters get themselves into that situation? Is it because of some unfortunate events that bestow upon them?, aka wrong place at the wrong time?, or how bout some really cunning and intelligent enemies?, no, the answer to all of that is a no. The characters meet their demise all because they make the most idiotic possible decisions alive that pretty much guarantee that their chance of survival is zero percent. The writing basically boils down to, we need this character to be all alone so they can be killed, and the way we go about that is we will make them separate from a group for practically no reason because writing skills are something the Japanese don't learn apparently. Rinse and repeat, and that is the exact summary of this Anime.If you want glorious examples, here they are for you to enjoy. Dipshit brother character realizes they are in a rather spooky place, he has the fortune of being right next to his younger sister when he starts exploring said spooky place. So instead of trying to arm himself or really do anything that would be beneficial to both of them, he instead finds a creepy looking ghost girl, who turns out to be the main antagonist,....clearly you need 200 IQ to put that one together. Instead of running away from creepy ghost looking girl, he allows her to stay with them, and when his younger sister who he promised to protect, needs to urinate, he tells her to be with the creepy looking ghost girl and to urinate away from his supervision while he goes wondering off by himself. Of course this backfires immediately, who would have thought? Resulting essentially in a horrible demise of the young girl, to top it off, he actually meets another guy before all this happens, and these two teenagers with their big boy brains decide not to venture off as a group where there are strength in numbers and to have emotional support available, nope lets split up, which of course unsurprisingly leads to the demise of the other guy as he succumbs to insanity, clearly these characters were just allergic to the idea of sticking together and all the advantages that might bring, especially when they are in an environment they have never seen before.Every other aspect of this Anime is also an abomination, there are gaping plot holes everywhere, which I would assume the crappy game probably attempted to explained, but here is just glossed over with no care. Sections of the story are just skipped, such as when blonde guy and blue haired girl (yes I did not remember their names, nether should you) were searching for objects to appease/put souls to rest, you are shown one entire sequence of them saving a young boy's soul when the girl is able to give him his tongue back, after that we cut to some other stupid characters, but once we get back to them, well they happened to find all the other tongues/objects they were looking for, of which we saw none of, so yeah just an entire section of plot skipped because time constraint. As for the plot itself, it is incredibly dull and crap in comparison to some of the greats that Japanese Horror has put out over the years, this clearly comes off as well, a crappy overrated mediocre RPG Maker horror game plot that only gained relevance because crappy overrated mediocre youtubers let's played them.The art and animation is okay, pretty much any modern Anime is going to have better art and animation than all time great blunders such as Twinkle Nora Rock and most of Idea's Factory's catalog. However, the actual gore itself is lazily done, with comical looking blood splatters that look like they were done in Microsoft Paint. The gore which is the main animation highlight falls flat on its face, there was much better and more detailed gore in alot of gory 80's OVA's, so check those out if you are into them for some reason. The art design looks okay but every female main character having practically  the same looking eyes reeks of cheapness and lack of any care or effort.In conclusion, if you think this is amazing then you are what is wrong with Anime. Just joking, don't take that seriously, but what I will say in all seriousness is that this is an example of a mediocre product gaining popularity due to help from outside influences, garnering attention and positive reactions as a result even when it flat out doesn't deserve it. This is a bottom of the barrel in terms of quality, people with influence such as let's players on Youtube should focus on lesser known high quality Anime games and shows as opposed to utter trash like this, and as a result indirectly promoting it. should never be promoted or accepted.So, the basic premise is that these cardboard characters are at their school late at night, doing some sort of farewell party for one of their friends, one character gets the idea to perform some stupid ritual, after this, shit hits the fan and now they are in a haunted Elementary school in some other dimension or some utter bullshit, and basically they have to survive all the threats they face, while attempting to maintain their sanity in the process. Oh yeah, there is also some crappy mystery they have to solve while they are there in order to get out.This all sounds nice and dandy, until you are hit with the sudden realization that these characters as a collective have the intelligence of a half-eaten potato. The sheer mental retardation on display is so utterly breathtaking that I stopped the Anime at various points to ponder if whoever wrote this truly understood what they were making their characters do. If I had to take a wild stab in the dark, whoever wrote this had an idea for how these characters were going to meet their demise, they were so focused on that aspect, and since they also cannot write for shit, forgot the very important part of, well how do the characters get themselves into that situation? Is it because of some unfortunate events that bestow upon them?, aka wrong place at the wrong time?, or how bout some really cunning and intelligent enemies?, no, the answer to all of that is a no. The characters meet their demise all because they make the most idiotic possible decisions alive that pretty much guarantee that their chance of survival is zero percent. The writing basically boils down to, we need this character to be all alone so they can be killed, and the way we go about that is we will make them separate from a group for practically no reason because writing skills are something the Japanese don't learn apparently. Rinse and repeat, and that is the exact summary of this Anime.If you want glorious examples, here they are for you to enjoy. Dipshit brother character realizes they are in a rather spooky place, he has the fortune of being right next to his younger sister when he starts exploring said spooky place. So instead of trying to arm himself or really do anything that would be beneficial to both of them, he instead finds a creepy looking ghost girl, who turns out to be the main antagonist,....clearly you need 200 IQ to put that one together. Instead of running away from creepy ghost looking girl, he allows her to stay with them, and when his younger sister who he promised to protect, needs to urinate, he tells her to be with the creepy looking ghost girl and to urinate away from his supervision while he goes wondering off by himself.

Just gore. A cheap form of horror. Nothing smart was done. Nothing was unsettling. Hell I don't think this can even be considered a horror it's so bad.The only thing unsettling about the show was how unrealistically gory the death scenes were. Like seriously, it's pathetic.There was barley any shadows or anything in the art, probably due to laziness. It was just...poorly adapted. The only thing I actually liked about this shitshow was the opening. That was actually okayHow can any horror fan like this? poorly adapted.

The art is good, and the gore is rendered very well. The sound is another bonus point, with plenty of squishing noises to suffice.-The consWhile you could say the anime is basically spot-on for following the actual storyline, it ruins itself by trying to cater too much to its audience. There are plenty of needless panty shots, and if that's your thing, then sure go...ahead. However, personally, I find that flashing teenage girls' panties-whilst their friends (and themselves) are getting brutally murdered, cheapens the horror.OVERALL, if you have played the game already-don't watch the anime. If you want a short gorefest, go ahead and watch. If you're looking for something serious, don't waste your time. ahead.

I like conceptual horror fine, but random teenagers getting killed in nasty ways is not typically my jam if there isn't something interesting to back it up, like with Danganronpa for instance.I saw this one with a few friends who were obsessed with it, and to its credit, it filled the bill serviceably. Corpse Party is decently animated, mercifully brief, and has enough of the squeamish gore, the type of stuff happening to eyes or vulnerable body parts that make you clutch yourself and squirm, to tide over any gaggle of bored teenagers looking for...something mature and scary to get each other good and spooked up.That said, without wishing to spoil the thematic core here is really nothing special, which means you don't leave the show with any lasting fear of universal problems represented via spooky slasher spirits. The lack of depth to the horror makes it feel a bit juvenile, and the interchangeably underdeveloped characters make it easy to lose your investment and root against them (or make a fun little drinking game around repetitive dialogue).I'm not trying to ruin your fun if you like this, but let's just say anyone who isn't already super into it by the title and bloody preview images alone won't find much else to win them over. something mature and scary to get each other good and spooked up.That said, without wishing to spoil the thematic core here is really nothing special, which means you don't leave the show with any lasting fear of universal problems represented via spooky slasher spirits.

In this first episode we get no explanation why are they there which is ok but fucking annoying. The characters are just so so so stupid. First of all. The girl hangs herself and her friend is looking at her while she is fucking dying and saying how she will help her. She goes for a fucking bucket while she dies. How stupid do you need to be to do this? She could've literally just lifted her up. But anyways in the second episode a sister of Satoshi (generic fucking name) goes to pee....They are outside the school. She decides it's good idea to go pee near the forest with a fucking dead child next to her. Offcourse she comes back but her brother is already inside where he gets attacked. He tries to go out but the door is fucking locked for no reason. Really terrible anime. I watched 2 episodes and I want to cry. I'm going to complete it because I should watch bad anime to understand what makes anime good. Do I recommend this? FUCKING NOT! Please do not waste 1 hour and 40 minutes watching this fucking garbage.Ok, I just completed the third episode and I need to say that this episode was pretty good. Characters are still stupid as fuck. First of all, Shinozaki is falling and Kishinuma is standing next to her like a fucking retard. Later he reveals that he loves her but couldn't he just catch her back then. It's common sense to catch a falling lady. Anyways when Shinozaki is about to come back to the world he fucking refuses to go with her. Like does he fucking expect that she won't be scared etc? If there would be a frightened girl with me and she would want to go save others I would fucking go with her. Even if I would've been scared as fuck. But anyway he doesn't go. Shinozaki then finds Yuka who gets brutally fucking tortured. Shinozaki then gets attacked by some ugly bastard (haha) and some the fuck how Kishinuma safes her. Like how the fuck did he get there. We literally saw how the portal closed he had zero chance to get there. After that Shinozaki runs away. She hides in a room where Satoshi finds her. After that, we see Kishinuma with half of his face in blood coming into the screaming to them to run away. Then he gets scissors pierced through his fucking stomach and face. Well, I will say it was pretty gory but still not that good. Oh and Yuka pissed herself back then which I don't really get because in episode 2 she went to take a pee. And she also stored her panties in an old cabinet.Just finished 4th episode. Well, pretty good one we get everything explained as we should. But still, the characters are so fucking dumb. Naomi just randomly shouts to Seiko when she clearly saw she is fucking dead and she got her tongue cut out. Well, I'm giving this 3/10.

A story that makes you feel hope love and horror, throgh the eyes of an incredibly well written cast of characters. That is how I would describe the Corpse Party game. The anime adaptation however, is quite possibly the worst piece of media I have ever experienced, and it brings shame to one of the greatest horror games ever made. The story is way to short to do anything interesting, or even give the characters any development. This leaves the story nonsensical, and the let me stress, the characters in this adaptaition are barely cardboard cut outs of the characters they...are based on. are based on.', ""Corpse Party is a franchise that is very important to me. I played Blood Covered when I was ten (yeah, I was WAY too young to be getting into this stuff) and found out what anime was through the games. I still adore the games, they're some of my favorite games. Corpse Party Tortured Souls was my first anime, besides Sailor Moon and Pokemon and other childhood anime. It's the anime that got me into anime, but... it's not very good? Amazing I'm such a big anime fan when THIS is the first thing I watched.This is not going to be a spoiler-free review for...the anime and game, because I will be pointing out the difference between the two. Although Blood Covered is still a great stand-alone game, but the franchise itself has a very complex, long story, but when adapting it into anime, they turned it into a 4-episode OVA... This could've been great, had they made it longer, and actually followed the goddamn story, but they clearly didn't care about the story. They just wanted to make some gory, edgy bullshit. This anime is known for being shocking and gory, but that doesn't make it good.This anime is super fast-paced, they condensed the whole game into 4 episodes, less than an episode per chapter. Instead of you uncovering all the bits and pieces of the lore on your own, it gets info-dumped at the end. Instead of feeling the suspense of discovering the mysteries of Heavenly Host and the Sachiko Ever After Charm, you just... watch teenagers get brutally murdered. This anime doesn't care about the story or any of the characters and their development or backstories. Hell, the characters' backstories are only really mentioned in the special, Missing Footage. With the games, you get to know the characters and their home lives, so when they die, you feel bad for them, because you're emotionally attached to them. In the anime, I wouldn't have cared watching them die if it weren't for the fact I was already attached to them from playing the game.In the game, four of the main characters died, Seiko, Mayu, Morishige and Ms. Yu. These deaths all have a place in the story and make sense. Seiko's death acts as character development for Naomi and also puts despair into the characters and the player, with the most cheerful character dying. Mayu's death gave us more insight into Morishige's character, showing how reliant he was on her and how despite his stoic nature, on the inside he was unhinged. Mayu's death directly causes Morishige's. Morishige commits suicide after realizing he had taken pictures and touched her corpse. Ms. Yu's death is foreshadowed early on, with her stating she's willing to die to save her students, which she does. She sacrificed herself to save the kids. These deaths all make sense. The anime, however, kills almost everyone in nonsensical ways for nonsensical reasons.The first two deaths stay relatively the same, just not as effective since the aftermath and the effect of their death isn't explored as much. It doesn't really show Naomi's mental distress and self-blaming. Once a character dies, they're forgotten. the anime doesn't realize or utilize what makes Seiko's death so emotional. Naomi just gets over it.And Morishige's reaction to Mayu's death is done so poorly. Rather than feeling so disgusted with himself and so alone now that Mayu, the only person he cares about, is gone that he kills himself, he just... goes crazy? He chases after Yuka, which also happens in the game, but it's before he finds out about Mayu's death and is to show that Yuka is scared of him and that he has lost his mind to some extent. Morishige is harmless in that chase scene. If you get caught, he asked you why you're running and the chase continues. He's a creepy guy, but you're still supposed to feel bad for him. In the anime, he tried to murder Yuka during the chase scene. Now instead of being a character you can feel bad for, he's just a silly villain. He's as bad as Kizami. Speaking of which, he dies by being stabbed in the neck by Kizami, who 'saves' Yuka, and later tortures her to death. We'll get back to the torture stuff in a second, but anyways, having someone murder Morishige because he 'went crazy', eliminates any sympathy you have for him. Rather than a tragic story of a socially awkward kid committing suicide after his only friend died, it's just crazy dude gets stabbed by another crazy dude.Oh God, and Ms. Yu's death. her death was foreshadowed a lot. She ultimately sacrifices herself to save her students and help them escape. In the anime, however, her head gets decapitated by a board while she's in the middle of a conversation with Ayumi. It's all for shock value. it's so sudden it makes you gasp and get grossed out by the gore and Ayumi's screams, but besides that there's no emotional response, because the deaths in this anime aren't emotional, they're purely for shock value.Back to Yuka's death. I feel like Yuka's death was just an excuse to have a torture scene, or to give Corpse Party fans who hate Yuka the opportunity to watch her die. Not much to say about it, it didn't piss me off as much, it was just cheap. Now for the other characters that they killed off only in the anime. Yoshiki was my favorite character, and watching him try to protect Ayumi, his crush, and both of them ultimately surviving in the end was satisfying, even if Ayumi was kind of whiny and annoying sometimes. In the anime, however, they just killed Yoshiki last minute, for no reason. In the anime, he saved Yuka (who ended up dying anyway) and sacrificed himself so the others could escape but... that was Ms. Yu's job. But oh, they decapitated her for shock value so now Yoshiki has to take her place! Ayumi acts as a damsel in distress through certain parts of the story, with her getting possessed and crying. A lot. You play as Yoshiki and save her, so both of them making it out alive was a great outcome for them, but instead, they had to use Yoshiki as the sacrifice because they threw Ms. Yu in the trash. And it's not even accurate to his character. In the game, he didn't want to go back to the school to save everyone else, since he and Ayumi were already safe, showing that he can be a bit selfish, but the anime doens't care about the characters, they just want more gore.Now onto the last death, Satoshi. Satoshi is supposed to be considered the main character but he's my least favorite. I thought he was boring in the game. Yoshiki would've been a better protag in my opinion, even though Satoshi, Yoshiki, Ayumi, and Naomi all kind of share that role. Anyways, at the end of the anime, Satoshi goes home with Ayumi and Naomi, the only characters left, and when they get back... only his arms returns? Then the anime ends. What. Why. You just really had to throw in one more character death, didn't you? The original game had such a sad ending, what the fuck is this?God I just ranted for so long. Anyways as for more minor things like art and sound, I like the opening but don't really remember any of the other OST. The games have an amazing OST. The opening is sung by Asami Imai, Ayumi's voice actor, just like many of the songs from the game, so it fits right in with the game's soundtrack. And the art... ugh. The art style is very basic. It looks like they tried to follow the game's art style, which looks like a basic anime style, but has enough quirks to make it recognizable, and botched it. Also, everything is so dark and grainy. I know they're in a dark, haunted school but come on. It's so dark I can barely tell what's going on.Anyways, if you wanna get into Corpse Party, just play the games and skip this anime. There's really no point in watching, it doesn't add anything to the story, just painfully waters it down. the anime and game, because I will be pointing out the difference between the two.

I know they're in a dark, haunted school but come on. It's so dark I can barely tell what's going on.Anyways, if you wanna get into Corpse Party, just play the games and skip this anime. There's really no point in watching, it doesn't add anything to the story, just painfully waters it down."", ""I thought I was going to enjoy an anime based off of the Corpse Party games, but what I got was literal disappointment. I love all the Corpse Party Games and Manga, Corpse Party :Tortured Souls absolutely failed as an anime. So much info and details are missing, its like the producers didn't even try. They didn't even put in most of the characters. I'm very sad and disappointed... If you're gonna watch this anime, play the games first and see what I mean.I didn't like this anime for obvious reasons: lack of information and character. Corpse Party: Tortured Souls, is like a very low...quality horror movie. I will admit, Corpse Party, (NOT Tortured Souls) has a very good soundtrack. I think Team Gris Gris did a good job on the games and music. quality horror movie. I will admit, Corpse Party, (NOT Tortured Souls) has a very good soundtrack.

There is surprisingly some quality mystery included in the story too. I think the story was the best part, it's a horror anime so they mostly focus on the gore, but I'd give it a high 9 at how thought out is was.(for a horror anime) Some parts might be a little confusing, so you have to focus on the details, but for the most part it's understandable. Haha, I also think 90% of the lower reviews are because of favorite characters being killed off....Might shed a few tears here and there. But, even if it's frustrating, it's not bad. Over all a 7 because it's decent. Might shed a few tears here and there. But, even if it's frustrating, it's not bad.

It doesn't pretend to more than that, so at least it's not pretencious.Since it's also very short, it's runtime doesn't let it to build up to much, but to the show's regard, it doesn't feel rushed or dragged out.

They can range from a fun and action-packed ride (like Akiba's Trip: The Animation) to a forgettable piece of mediocrity (like Stand My Heroes: Piece of Truth). And horror anime, well, they're even more iffy. So when you set out to make a horror anime based on a videogame, the odds are already stacked against you. Those of you reading those of you reading this review have probably also noticed the rather small episode count this show has, even though the game it is supposedly adapting takes hours upon hours to complete, and has multiple well-crafted endings. All...of the aforementioned details led to an anime that, well, let's just say, dropped the ball in just about every way. This show was really hard for me to get through, and now I think its time to go over exactly why.Visuals: The visuals for CPTS are. . . alright, I suppose. The character designs are very generic, but since most of the show takes place in almost total darkness, it probably doesn't matter much anyway. Speaking of visuals, I should probably address the massive amounts of gore and violence in this show. I'm not one of those people who really like or dislike gore, but I still feel like it could have been used more effectively, which leads right into the next category.Horror: Horror tends to be subjective, so keep that in mind for the duration of this section. In my opinion, Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is not even a remotely scary anime. It falls into the same trap that a majority of the SAW movies fall into, which is using excessive amounts of blood, guts, and bodily violence to freak out the viewer. And that, in my eyes is scraping the bottom of the horror barrel. I really don't think any lower form of horror exists, and this show's frequent use of such horror is one of the main reasons I dislike this anime so much.Characters: As I mentioned before, some corners will inevitably be cut when adapting a multihour game into a 4 episode anime. One major corner, in this case, ended up being virtually all character development. The characters are at best, underdeveloped, and at worst, terribly written. The characters are in fact probably one of the worst aspects of this show.Overall Thoughts: Corpse Party: Tortured Souls is not only a disappointment to videogame-to-anime adaptations and horror anime everywhere, but also a disappointment tot the horror genre as a whole.Final Score: 4 of the aforementioned details led to an anime that, well, let's just say, dropped the ball in just about every way.

The game was incredible with the character development, the story line, the plot, the suspense; everything combined to make it an amazing story and game.This anime/OVA series as I would call it, did not live up to the standards that were set by the game. The reason behind what happens would make no sense to someone who has not played the game or at least watched someone else play the game. You would be extremely confused and turned off right away as the entire series of Corpse Party: Tortured Souls...is gore, blood and guts. So if you are not familiar with the game\'s story or meaningless gore and killing, this will not be an enjoyable series to watch.Art: (9)Despite the gore, the art is definitely very well done. Very well drawn and unfortunately, the gore is drawn ""well"" as well. I definitely enjoyed the art style of this series as it was one of the best qualities of the anime.Sound: (7)The opening song definitely is one of my favorite songs for an anime opening as it sets the mood for what is about to come in the series. The background music throughout gives the atmospheric vibe that they want you to be in during this time. Anxious, suspenseful and nervous. One of the better aspects of this anime series.Characters: (4)Characters were developed so well within the game that you knew the personalities of almost every single main character by heart. This anime just assumes that you have played the game and decided to not develop any of the characters at all throughout the four episode series. Mostly, because there is just no time to do so.You have no personal connection to these characters if you have not played the game so you really don\'t feel anything when someone ends up dying in the end.Enjoyment: (7)Since I have played the game previously, I knew the characters enough to feel attachment to them and to be upset when someone would die. Although, even though Corpse Party is a horror based game, the gore was definitely completely overdone for me. I had to stop watching a few times because it just didn\'t make any sense why they were making it as violent as they did in this anime.Overall: (6)I do not know if I would watch it again. I think if you\'re a fan of the game and of the game series, you might want to watch this series at least once as it is only four episodes long and does not follow the true end of the game.I enjoyed it as it is part of the series and I really enjoy the Corpse Party games but I would never just tell someone to watch this for enjoyment. is gore, blood and guts.

I was intrigued at first by the setup and was eagerly watching. My problem is not that it isn\'t scary, you can always get cheap scares by using jump scares, my problem with the show was that there was no suspense, there is no build-up, nothing that creates anticipation for a reveal, it fell completely flat.Sound is a very important aspect of any visual medium, especially in...the horror genre where you could use the power of silence, good sound effects, and music to create anticipation.For a show that has a very interesting setup, the characters are too forgettable and annoying at times to watch, which made the entire experience worse. They do not make rational decisions and yes I understand this could be a reflection of their frightened mind at the time and their young age but, they seem pretty calm while talking to a ghost, even after it reveals itself as a ghost. One of them goes insane out of nowhere, his transition or his motives weren\'t shown.The show has gore, guts and mindless killing but, that isn\'t scary, it quickly became a bit of a drag and quite predictable except for the ending of the series which I wasn\'t expecting. I was so bored by then and thought that it was going to transport the rest of the characters back and their friends are all going to be waiting for them on the other side. It caught me off guard.

Luckily it was only 4 episodes long, although each one lasts half an hour.Phew. This is the kind of anime you would have recommended to your sixth-grader friends as a dare. Only if you actually had any anime friends as a sixth grader.It\'s known for being creepy and particularly gory. Too bad it\'s not the former. I remember watching the first episode when I was much younger, and it scared me shitless. However, I never seemed to watch it any further. When I was older, I tried again several...times, but stopped out of boredom.Now I have finally watched all the episodes!Unbelievably stupid. That\'s what the anime should be called: ""Corpse Party: Stupid People Do Stupid Things and Die"". Although the anime is not scary in any way because it\'s way too tryhard and just throws everything at you without building tension (it pretty much ignores all the rules of creating a competent horror series), it was still very hilarious watching these stupid characters die. They really do have an IQ lower than teens from the worst horror slasher. It\'s just unbelievable. Totally incomprehensible actions and ridiculous, absurd dialogue. But that\'s what makes it so funny.In the second episode they try to build up some kind of plot, but it falls completely flat because they tried to squeeze a game (the anime is based on a visual novel) with several parts and storylines into four episodes. That\'s why NOTHING makes sense. There are also way too many characters who all look the same and whose names I could never remember. They all have as much personality as a blank piece of paper and can be summed up in one-word-descriptions.Story: incomprehensible, full of plotholes, rushed, impactless.Characters: inhuman, stupid, flat, annoying, disagreeable.Animation: holy! I hate this art style! Just extremely bland and uninspiring. They did a good job with the atmosphere of the old school building where it all takes place, but the character design is terribly boring, as everyone looks the same. Then the most important thing for me: the gore! Was that good at least? No! Unfortunately, not. Guts were way too pink, and everything just looked so.... Fake and unrealistic.Music/Sound: I actually liked the OP, it established the atmosphere and setting well. The ED was generic and quickly forgotten. The sound design was quite alright. I feel like they went a bit overboard with the ""squishy"" sounds of the intestines though, as well as all the cracking sounds for the bones. But it sounded disgusting, so I guess it did the job. Music was unimpressive, but punctuated scenes appropriately. The voice acting was surprisingly good as far as the screaming is concerned. Extra points for the maniacal laughter of people who went insane. Other than that, the voice of the little girl who is supposed to be in middle school but sounds and acts like a three-year-old got on my nerves. Really annoying.Unfortunately, the horror of this horror anime fell absolutely flat, as did the gore aspect. I\'m sometimes quite sensitive to gore, but nothing here moved me.

While I watched this little OVA that long ago as well, Corpse Party: Tortured Souls (CP: TS) has remained firmly in my memory as one of the greatest works of gore to come out of Japan. That being said, CP: TS is in effect a retelling of Corpse Party: Blood Covered (CP: BC). Let me take you back to the height of CP from 2008 to 2014.Corpse Party's peakIn 2008, Makoto Kedōin, creator of Corpse Party since 1996 was ready to release his commercial...copy of Corpse Party in Japan; later receiving a worldwide release in 2011. In this imminent growth of his domain, he began making manga and other media to expand upon the universe; one of these was a Manga by the name of Corpse Party: Musume. Apart from being set in the same universe, Corpse Party: Musume takes the characters he created and twist their roles. For example, Yoshiki turns from this active hero archetype to this creep that scares Ayumi and so on. That being said, the scene was set for CP: TS to tell its own rendition of Corpse Party.Tortured SoulsSo what about this anime, Well apart from the fact that this story is a brief retelling of Corpse Party Blood Covered, CP: TS must condense a 10-hour game into just 2; Dose it succeed? Well Yes and No. Yes because it depicts Corpse Party as we've never seen it before. The animation on par with other gory anime at the time like 'Another' really immerses the watcher into the world of Heavenly Host.Why no?The shortcomings of CP: TS are in the abbreviated style of storytelling. While Chapters 1 and 2 were easily condensed into the first 2 episodes, the remaining story is rushed and lacks context. Likewise, the Characters, while supported by the supplement of the games do not get the chance to flesh out by themselves here. That being said, there is a way to get the most enjoyment out of watching CP: TS.RecommendationWhat I wish to convey here is CP: TS is best enjoyed AFTER completing the main game. Here in 2021, there is a multitude of ways to play CP: BC including a recent release on PS4 and Nintendo Switch. If you're on the fence about this series, hold off on it until you've really experienced the Corpse Party story; You'll find more enjoyment out of CP: TS when you treat it as a supplement to the games.

That's all I have to say for now, thanks for reading."", ""Story: 4Okay, the story is heavily rushed and there are so many plot holes. I'm not going to give any spoiler about this and i think this anime would be better made in 1 cour (12 eps) instead of 4.

I appreciated Asread for the animation. You can clearly see the blood coming out and you can also see the guts coming out clearly. Though my problem is that too dark. You can...barely see anything on it.Sound: 9Love the OP. Somehow, it fitted the anime so much and i gotta give the credits to the seiyuu. They tried so hard to make it believable like scream hysterically. They put a lot of souls into it.Character: 4Well, some characters are good and some of them are annoying. That's all i can say.Enjoyment: 6Kinda enjoyed the show but as i mentioned before, boring characters, dark scenery, plot holes and everything makes you confuse.Overall: 6If you're fan of horror anime, i recommend you to watch this.

And also my review will be short.STORY — 1/10Script of this anime is a fucking masterpiece. It\'s a total mess. It doesn\'t even have a ""flow"" of a story, You just ate one story-twist after another without any sense-filler-background. And of course you won\'t understand half of events of anime.ART — 5/10Characters, gore, meat and all other stuff looks OK. Not perfect but not poorly bad. So why just 5/10? Because of damn darkness. Darkness, darkness, darkness. 75% of anime will be in total darkness.SOUND — 7/10Sound is OK too. A few actors don\'t...try enough but it\'s still OK.CHARACTERS — 1/10Remember story? Yeah, same shit. Total mess. They\'re all incredibly stupid idiots. They did some stuff without any thinking \'bout it. Becoming spontaneous hysterical without reasons. Split up with other chars without reasons. Especially I love that onii-chan who don\'t even care \'bout his imouto — he left her with deadly scary ghost when she wants to pee. And right after that he LEAVES them and CLOSE the door after himself.ENJOYMENT — 3/10Why 3 and not 1? Because this anime is so incredibly stupid that it becomes even funnyEven if you love gore and violence (like me) I strongly recommend to ignore this piece of animation.

Voice-Acting, music and animation are all top-notch.The characters and story however are not as good.This show feels like fan-service for people who have played the game.Not in the sense of half naked characters running around the screen every 2 seconds, but more so it feels this show was created to let people who have played the games, see the gory scenes in a better quality than the pixelated game-version.I go into more details why I feel this way in the Story part of the review.If you have not played the games but want to watch this show, I recommend playing the game first. I am not 100% sure (like I said I have not played the games) but I assume (and hope), the whole thing makes more sense if you have played the games.Story: 4/10A group of friends together with their teacher and one of the friends little sister are performing a charm which is said to help people stay together for ever. This does not work out quite the way they expected and so the group finds itself in a cursed middle school where they not only have to find a way back hope but also try and stay same while experiencing a lot of hardships.Sounds really interesting, however the execution is not good.This show would have benefited a lot from a longer runtime. If they had made a whole season of 12 episodes, this could have been an amazing, scary and interesting show. The first Episode feels more like a second, so adding an actual first Ep. and cutting down the runtime from 30 to 20 minutes would already give 6 Episodes, then adding the plot-holes and skipped scenes and there you go a nice 12 Episode long anime.Unfortunately all we get are 4, 30 Minutes long OVA Episodes.This forced the creators to rush things and give next to no explanations on anything.Therefore story is riddled with plot-holes,characters change their whole personality from one scene to the next and the error during the execution of the charm is hardly even explained to the point where even at the end when they have to do it ""right"" it\'s still not clear to the viewer whether or not they actually did it right that time, or not.(I am talking about the amount of times they have to say the phrase not the dude who, you know what...)Some characters seem do ""disappear"" at some point just to turn back up later, and then ""disappear"" again a couple minutes later. Making you wonder why they even came back in the first place.Not to mention the stupid actions of some of the characters.It\'s a confusing mess.But at least it is somewhat decently explained how the whole curse started.Art: 8/10For a show which story-wise feels like a fan-service show, the animations are unexpectedly high and nice to look at.The gory scenes look nice, and while there are a few scenes that look a bit comedic (even tho they are supposed to be gory and terrifying) the whole show looks really solid.A pleasant surprise.Sound: 9/10The sound is phenomenal.The OP is really nice to listen to while still making you feel a bit uneasy. The ending is beautiful and calming, so if you were scared by the episode it help really helps to relax again.The voice-acting is great too.Characters: 4/10Not the most interesting bunch of people, but I guess a series like this does not need the most complex characters or Character-development to work. However, the stupidity of some of them is at times a bit much.Enjoyment: 5/10I watched this a couple years back for the first time and found this show amazingly entertaining.However after re-watching it I realize I was more fascinated by the amount of gore and death that anything else.After re-watching and paying attention to the show as a whole, the flaws are striking, and the enjoyment-factor drops significantly.All things considered, this show is best consumed mindlessly.As long as you watch it for the visuals and music, without paying attention to the plot or characters it is really enjoyable.In that case I would probably rate it an 8 out of 10, but nowadays I do like to pay attention to everything, and therefore this show is a lot less enjoyable.

A warning to users before watching this, if you aren’t used to gore then don’t watch this please. I have watched many movies/shows with tons of gore and it still unsettles me when I watch something so gory like this anime. Overall the story is very short, group of friends perform ritual, teleports to spirit world and experience all kinds of horror and ultimately death. *Spoiler Alert* only 2 of the group makes it out. The characters were not very developed as it had to fit the short plot line but the...sound was good as they were detailed and made it very clear to what was happening in those censored scenes. Not a very good anime to enjoy based off a game in my opinion but i do applaud it for keeping true to the horror theme. It is unfortunate to what happens in the end overall as the ending is dark and of course not everyone makes it but hey the story did its job and carried out what needed to be carried out. A good horror series to see is Another which has a solid story line, characters and keeps it theme under horror. Corpse Party can be considered as a downgraded short version of Another but the gore I feel is more intense but the story is not as good. In Another, you still get to feel the same exhilarating feel of a horror plot line and mystery but the gore is a bit gentler and not as horrific as Corpse Party. Corpse Party really focuses on sound effects which makes it more unsettling to watch when viewing censored scenes. You could also say Corpse Party was a bit more messed up than other horror series as it involves elementary school children doing the scaring and not the usual mid-teens to adults age group. sound was good as they were detailed and made it very clear to what was happening in those censored scenes.

In general I don't have a problem with horror animes but this one almost made me want to throw up. Whenever the killer or a ghost kills somebody, they have to do it in the most unpleasant way as possible. I did not enjoy it at all and will probably never rewatch this anime. I also feel like the art style doesn't fit in with the story. I feel like the art is off of a shojo anime or something. But overall this anime I regret watching this disturbing anime and I suggest...you to not watch it if you already haven't. you to not watch it if you already haven't."", '\'Corpse Party: Tortured Souls\' is a predictable horror, mystery anime. It\'s labeled as a mystery but lacks that very thing. Right from the beginning in episode one, viewers are able to predict how the story is going to play out and what the twists will be causing viewers to lose their fascination and become bored.I cannot say if the show lacks horror or not, but it definitely did not spook in any shape or form. However, it is a Japanese show and their perception of horror may very well differ from mine. Japanese horror is based on their folklore whereas, America\'s perception of horror...is based on gore.Furthermore, if a show is going to lack a well-written storyline it should at the very least have interesting characters. Sadly, much to the dismay of viewers,  the characters in this show lack any depth. They are 2-dimensional with no backstory or ties to make them believable or interesting. Viewers are not sitting there watching and thinking ""Oh no, I don\'t want them to die!"" because, in reality, it doesn\'t matter if they die or not because they feel no emotional connection. Perhaps there could be the argument made that because the characters are young that if they are shown being put through drastic or gory measures then that could be disturbing, but personally I would prefer to have believable characters who are put into the real world of horror. is based on gore.Furthermore, if a show is going to lack a well-written storyline it should at the very least have interesting characters.

Why are there so many AMVs of this anime when there is so much potential in the games to make a GMV of???? Hell, what about a MMV (Manga music video)??????? Sometimes I forget that this anime exists and when I do I get upset about the fact that THIS anime is more popular in circles I am in than the games.At least they tried. That is all I can really say.Also this goes foe the games too but I REALLY hate Satoshi....He is a bland and boring character with no personality yet somehow has a harem that includes his own little sister for some reason.

The animation was good, although the plot of the story was not so strong.With only 4 episodes, there was never a moment that I felt that it had a story with a purpose.

If there were few more episodes, maybe the story could have been well executed, but unfortunately there wasn't.I personally liked Corpse Party, especially because of...its gore, rather than the horror.

It is an adaptation of the game, but is worse than the game. It's only 4 episodes long so it basically speedruns the story to get to one ending. I understand only adapting one ending, but they should've given it more than 4 episodes, maybe around at least 12. So while the story for the anime version is around a 5, the game's version is around a 8.

Another major problem is that it focuses more on just killing as many people as possible, even most of the ones who canonically survive in the games. Honestly I think this anime would have done a LOT better if it was able to unravel the story through more episodes.Hell, it could...have made for a great full-length anime, with OVA's exploring the 'different routes' and side stories of Book of Shadows, the Sachiko Birthday spin-off, and with a second season following the events of Blood Drive.So while I didn't enjoy the anime that much, it does make for great anime crack videos on youtube.

And most elements of Corpse Party are not executed well. Not even the characters (pun intended).Another piece of media Corpse Party tries to mimic is The Ring. If you have watched this movie or regularly watched horror movies in the past, Corpse Party will leave you unsatisfied. Because when the credits roll you will have this nagging feeling that you somehow experienced the conclusion before.At the end, Corpse Party is a slasher trying to be creepy, but ending up boring and nonsensical. Neither the journey nor the destination are worthwhile, but since you only need to invest 4 episodes the losses aren't too heavy. However, there was one memorable scene in which Satoshi sends his little sister to a field full of corpses where she can finally pee. But since he is a responsible older brother concerned for the safety of his little sister in the middle of the murder school he lets the random ghost the two just encountered go with her. All while telling her with a smile that he will be waiting inside. Hilarious. like watching someone playing a horror game. \u200bI think this concept could work, but only if executed well.

Episode 1 of Parasyte had more creative deaths than this.Also why the hell is ""yuka"" act and look like a 6 year old shes legit fucking 14 LMAO they do the worst job ever.

The anime butchers the anime is almost every way. The plot is chopped up, rearranged, and stuffed into 4 episodes. The characters are brought down to mindless clowns who I was glad got picked off so fast. The ending was so fucking absurd and silly like something fucking South Park would do with Kenny for a joke. But the gore in the anime is a step up from the game and is alot more detailed. Ill give praise where its due the music and voice work was pretty good...with good animation. If your looking for mindless murder like horror movies of old, give it a watch but I highly recommend the game. with good animation.

I had nightmares for weeks afterward (I realized years later I probably just am not a fan of horror/gore) and would get anxious anytime I thought about it. It\'s been almost ten years since I first watched it though and now I\'m more okay with saying it\'s not bad. As much as it sort of scarred me and made me not really want to get into anime, after seeing more anime over the years (some utter garbage) and having gotten past the ""trauma"" (terrible word...for it but I can\'t think of anything better atm) of watching this when I could not handle it, I think this anime is not bad.The music is pretty decent as well, it does a great job as a horror anime (I am sort of a pussy when it comes to horror, but it did a good job at keeping me anxious throughout the majority of it), and if that\'s your thing then I\'d say give it a go.

Also this review is more for people that already played the game or seen gameplay but you can still read if you want———————————-Oh man, let’s start with the characters yaaaaayyyyyOkay so Naomi is normal to how she was in the game. One thing you might find Annoying tho is how she snapped at seiko. I get it. She does it in the game too but in the game she didn’t snap as hard as she...did here. It’s weird how fast she snapped at her and just starts talking fast it almost feels outta place kinda. Again, I get it she snapped at her in game I just don’t like the way she snapped at her here. You also might not like how slow she was when it came to saving seiko. She kinda just pauses after she grappled the bucket like girl wtf save your fucking friend!! Unlike the game she just felt really slow there.Seiko, ayumi, yoshiki, Mayu, morishige, naho, mrs yui, and yuuya are normal to how they were in the game. So there’s not much to say about them.Satoshi am gonna rip tho. I wanna say am surprised I really do. Cause in the game he leaves yuka in a whole other school building (I don’t really remember if he did tho cause it’s been awhile since I played the game but I still wanna point it out because they was warned and still didn’t listen)Basically:Sachiko leads satoshi and Yuka outside after satoshi asked if there was a way out. He lets yuka go to the bathroom out there but told her to not go out in the woods. Yuka asks if sachiko could go with her and satoshi just lets a ghost go out with her little sister and not say anything?? Not only that BUT HE GOES BACK IN THE SCHOOL??? And got surprised when he heard yuka screaming outside??I wanna remind you that before all of this, morishige told both satoshi and yuka that there are ghosts in the school that attack people so they should be careful and you mean to tell me that these two dopes got surprised when the ghosts did what morishige said they were gonna do?? Really??The only thing I really like about this anime is what they did to yuka. I hate yuka so much so when they added that kill scene with her it was soooo satisfying. And they get som points for that——————————-Now let’s move on my comment with the pacingI get it’s only 4 episodes but god damn can we please speed it down a little?? Everyone dies so damn fast with mrs Yui’s being the fastest. There’s also these weird out of place time jumps and skips like for example:When yuuya kills morishige and yuka screams, yuuya’s skin is on and he’s fine. But when it cuts back with them, half of yuuya’ s skin is offEven tho all the episodes together are an hour it really didn’t feel like no hour with how fast everything goes———————————Overall this is not worth watching. Especially if you haven’t seen the game. It’s very rushed and out of place but if you still wanna watch it here be my guest: https://youtu.be/2vN5R2HtmBMJust don’t expect to be blessed with something special did here. It’s weird how fast she snapped at her and just starts talking fast it almost feels outta place kinda. Again, I get it she snapped at her in game I just don’t like the way she snapped at her here. You also might not like how slow she was when it came to saving seiko. She kinda just pauses after she grappled the bucket like girl wtf save your fucking friend!! Unlike the game she just felt really slow there.Seiko, ayumi, yoshiki, Mayu, morishige, naho, mrs yui, and yuuya are normal to how they were in the game. So there’s not much to say about them.Satoshi am gonna rip tho. I wanna say am surprised I really do. Cause in the game he leaves yuka in a whole other school building (I don’t really remember if he did tho cause it’s been awhile since I played the game but I still wanna point it out because they was warned and still didn’t listen)Basically:Sachiko leads satoshi and Yuka outside after satoshi asked if there was a way out. He lets yuka go to the bathroom out there but told her to not go out in the woods. Yuka asks if sachiko could go with her and satoshi just lets a ghost go out with her little sister and not say anything?? Not only that BUT HE GOES BACK IN THE SCHOOL??? And got surprised when he heard yuka screaming outside??I wanna remind you that before all of this, morishige told both satoshi and yuka that there are ghosts in the school that attack people so they should be careful and you mean to tell me that these two dopes got surprised when the ghosts did what morishige said they were gonna do?? Really??The only thing I really like about this anime is what they did to yuka. I hate yuka so much so when they added that kill scene with her it was soooo satisfying. And they get som points for that——————————-Now let’s move on my comment with the pacingI get it’s only 4 episodes but god damn can we please speed it down a little?? Everyone dies so damn fast with mrs Yui’s being the fastest. There’s also these weird out of place time jumps and skips like for example:When yuuya kills morishige and yuka screams, yuuya’s skin is on and he’s fine. But when it cuts back with them, half of yuuya’ s skin is offEven tho all the episodes together are an hour it really didn’t feel like no hour with how fast everything goes———————————Overall this is not worth watching. Especially if you haven’t seen the game.

It does a good job of making the characters' deaths meaningful.The downside to this show is that it is truly meant for people who have played the games, so the story feels a bit tangled and can be a bit confusing for those who haven't played the games. This is particularly true since there are nine characters and it is a struggle to keep track of who is who and what has happened to each one of them.That said, I am quite fond of this show and I think it has one of the best ending scenes I've seen.Needless...to say, this show is quite gory and dark, so people who don't like horror won't enjoy this one. to say, this show is quite gory and dark, so people who don't like horror won't enjoy this one."", 'kill or be killed and find tongues thats all there was to it, it was pretty brutal thoughthe characters were stupid and many of them couldve survived if they werent idiotsthe story was lacking at times and i think its kind of a waste of time but if you have it and love blood and panties like the author does it seems cause there was way too many panties scenes in this anime then go ahead and watch thiswhere i would like to give credit is the murder scenes that were well done and the animation was pretty good when its from 2013 ', 'after watching this show corpse party it feels like a knife cutting my shoulder and my hands feel shaky because of the bad things i see was not only blood in this show is making me feel very uncomfortable and i will not recommend you watching this. i find this from somewhere in youtube and the game was not fun at all there is no multiplayer is just a creepy boring girl following after you to stab you in the back which i can feel it. the show may look ugly to you and for me is like it is scary for me to sleep...alone which i cannot sleep after watching this show. this anime game version you find it but is not free to play alone which i cannot sleep after watching this show. this anime game version you find it but is not free to play', ""Corpse Party - My reviewCorpse Party - My reviewI would like to talk a little about the anime Corpse Party and leave my review and opinion about the anime since my favorite genre is horror, I always like to analyze the work well and then give my opinion, so here goes:This anime is good, the horror scenes and the sound design are great, but the animation and characters are simple to average and some things in the scenes are weak in the sense of logic. However, the horror scenes are very good and the anime really gives the sensation of scaring and causing strangeness and...bizarreness.ANIMATION STUDIO: asread.

The anime was created from the game which is a 2D game, there isn't much to expect as it is a great story but some elements that the plot delivers are interesting, watch and enjoy the bloodshed on your screen.VISUAL/ART: I didn't like it that much, but if you take the game into consideration it's ok. The anime is from 2013 but has similar art to animes from the mid-2004/2006 years... The anime fulfills its proposal of having a lot of brutality and the strongest point of all of the anime is this and for me the best thing about it . Other than that there's nothing very relevant, it's an average art.SOUNDPLASTY: congratulations, the anime's sounds and soundtrack are its greatest strengths, along with the death scenes and the setting and atmosphere of fear and agony that the anime manages to convey is surreal.

The list can go on forever but Corpse Party : Tortured Souls has a little something that sets it apart from the rest. This is probably the most f***ked up anime I\'ve seen (I said anime; Ive seen some other messed up stuff). They left no stone left unturned and it didn\'t really help that I was watching it at like 1 am in the morning.[Plot : 7/10] For the first 12 or 13 minutes I thought that this was super cliche and...boring and nothing exciting was happening. One girl has a crush on one of the guys. A teacher ends up breaking up the fun etc. A group of students telling ghost stories in an abandoned building sounds very original right? Everything took a turn for the worse when all of the supernatural events started happening. At first the plot feels really boring but as the story progresses the there\'s a lot of good plot twists to keep the watcher watching. The plot isn\'t really the best part of this anime.

However as the story progresses the inner feelings of the characters come out and you see how they begin to change when confronted with despair.[Art 9/10] The art was really really good.

Its really graphic though so I wouldn\'t recommend this if you cant stand blood or the sight of someone getting splattered all over a wall.

This OVA series lasts 4 episodes, each episode running approximately 30 minutes in length. And with the runtime of a single film, this is not a series that should be passed up.The story of Corpse Party is your normal horror story, but with some mystery mixed in to give things a bit more flavor. This is a good thing because if it wasn't for the mystery part of it, the horror part would just be an excuse to watch people be brutally murdered in glorious 720p HD. And while I'd normally...prefer more story with my anime, this series still managed to satisfy me because it kept me entertained for two whole hours and actually managed to make me jump once or twice, something most horror series have trouble doing because they're so predictable. And while I wouldn't necessarily say that Corpse Party isn't predictable at times, it at least tries to keep you guessing at to who'll die next and in what way. The only true negative I saw however, was that its video game roots were clear at times.The art design of Corpse Party fits very well with its horror theme. Most colors were muted so that darker colors such as green, red, and white stuck out far more than others. At the same time, the art was almost constantly highly detailed. The production spared no expense making this series look beautiful. The gore is also draw with quite the attention to detail. They pretty much had everything including the kitchen sink. Eyeballs being ripped from sockets, shiny pink intestines with trails of blood running off of them, fists punching through heads, hearts, brains, decomposing flesh, and of course, no corpse would be complete without maggots. This kind of detail is rare to see, and I can only really think of a few examples that have gone that far.Corpse Party features an amazing sound design that really speaks volumes to its horror lineage. Creaking floorboards, a clock striking midnight, the sounds of body parts being ripped off, other gore related sounds, spooky voices, evil laughter, etc. It's all there and does not disappoint. The soundtrack also goes nicely with the series speaking to both the horror and mystery of it. Need a horror cue? It's there. Need something to spice up a mystery scene? No problem. Now, that's not to say the music is perfect. It's just fitting and works nicely. Since there's no dub, I obviously watched a subbed version of it. The acting, as far as I'm able to tell, is quite good(Though the quality of the subs I used was questionable at times.). The actors convey the horror quite nicely with screams, moans, laughing, anger, etc.Corpse Party features no fewer than 15 characters, but only 11 of them are prominent. Nine of which are the actual cast of protagonists. Well, actually, after a while it becomes hard to call some of them protagonists. They at least stand out from one another during their on-screen time. However, I found it kind of hard to really care for any of the characters, in part due to the shows relatively short length and the fact that most of the characters don't get any development whatsoever. Again, mostly due to the short run time. Brief bits of character development show what could have been promising characters, but it is otherwise short lived and just about nothing comes of it. Moral of the story: You probably won't get attached to any of the characters. And if you do get attached to one, you might want to say some prayers or whatever it is you decide to do for their soul just in case.Overall, it wasn't a bad series at all. It's enjoyable and horror fans will probably get a kick out of the gore and scares, while mystery fans should be pleased with the mystery solving portion of it. However, the series really could have benefited from a longer running length and more character development. Possibly even more of a story could've helped as well, but the basic framework of the story held up on its own well enough. So I definitely recommend this series to anyone with a strong stomach. If you don't have a strong stomach... you might want to keep a bucket or trash bin on hand. prefer more story with my anime, this series still managed to satisfy me because it kept me entertained for two whole hours and actually managed to make me jump once or twice, something most horror series have trouble doing because they're so predictable.

The violence is too upfront about itself and you soon find the plot gives no expectations about anyone surviving. Everybody is so obviously doomed from the get go.The good part of it is the story behind the curse, or rather, the place created by it.

Kaijuu Girls Kuro: Ultra Kaijuu Gijinka Keikaku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37586/Kaijuu_Girls_Kuro__Ultra_Kaijuu_Gijinka_Keikaku,"['I picked this movie out, at random, basically on a whim, when I was browsing Hidive’s film library. I had zero knowledge of it, or expectations going in. After about ten minutes in I was truly baffled, and went off to figure out what in the world I’d gotten myself into.15 minutes later, after taking down some notes on a nearby post-it, I had a rough idea of things.Kaiju Girls Black is a feature film anime sequel to the Kaiju Girls anime series, which I had not watched prior to screening this film, while I played Minecraft; now I understood, at least in part, why...I was so confused. This is the kind of movie that it helps to have gone into with some base level of connection to the franchise. Basically a movie made for the fans.In short, Kaiju Girls is a Gijinka (think anthropomorphic) series in which various Kaiju (from Ultraman? I think, based off reading some wiki articles and watching a YouTube explanation vid) take the form of cute, kawaii, moe anime girls (most likely in an effort to sell merch).Now, lots of anime is only made to promote LN’s or Blu-Rays, or sell Toys, so I’m not one to really judge things out of the gate. Transformers, a series made to sell toys, has now had 6 feature films, which have, according to a quick google search, about $4.8 billion in total box office. Plus they probably did also sell a lot of toys too, but I’ll not get into that. What I’m saying is, I’m not going to wholly discount this movie because it may or may not have been just a toy commercial.With that being said… I bet you expect me to now say the movie was absolute garbage and trash it, but you’d be surprised, because this wasn’t that bad a film. It lacked much substance, and so will this review. It certainly wasn’t amazing; but I got a few giggles, and occasional chortle, out of it, the animation was clean, it was delightfully self-aware, the voice acting was well done, and the characters were pretty decent to look at in terms of originality (and cuteness). Given that this was probably being marketed at middle school – high school kids (and all the otaku as well), I think that says a lot considering I’m well out of those demographics (though I suppose I am an otaku).So I guess what I’m trying to say is that this movie succeeded in making me curious enough about the franchise that I’m now putting the original anime into my ptw list with all the other stuff… there’s quite a bit in there now, but I’m gradually getting through it. I was so confused. This is the kind of movie that it helps to have gone into with some base level of connection to the franchise.

I think, based off reading some wiki articles and watching a YouTube explanation vid) take the form of cute, kawaii, moe anime girls (most likely in an effort to sell merch).Now, lots of anime is only made to promote LN’s or Blu-Rays, or sell Toys, so I’m not one to really judge things out of the gate. Transformers, a series made to sell toys, has now had 6 feature films, which have, according to a quick google search, about $4.8 billion in total box office. Plus they probably did also sell a lot of toys too, but I’ll not get into that. What I’m saying is, I’m not going to wholly discount this movie because it may or may not have been just a toy commercial.With that being said… I bet you expect me to now say the movie was absolute garbage and trash it, but you’d be surprised, because this wasn’t that bad a film. It lacked much substance, and so will this review. It certainly wasn’t amazing; but I got a few giggles, and occasional chortle, out of it, the animation was clean, it was delightfully self-aware, the voice acting was well done, and the characters were pretty decent to look at in terms of originality (and cuteness). Given that this was probably being marketed at middle school – high school kids (and all the otaku as well), I think that says a lot considering I’m well out of those demographics (though I suppose I am an otaku).So I guess what I’m trying to say is that this movie succeeded in making me curious enough about the franchise that I’m now putting the original anime into my ptw list with all the other stuff… there’s quite a bit in there now, but I’m gradually getting through it.']"
Kagewani: Shou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32682/Kagewani__Shou,"['Kagewani: Shou is the second season of Kagewani series. I would recommend watching it after you finish the first season because some parts could be a little bit confusing if you jump directly into the second one. And for you who already watched the first season and enjoyed it, you must definitely watch the second one too, because it’s amazing.The episodes are pretty much all connected together and the plot is really exciting and easy to follow because it mostly revolves around Banba and his fight with Kagewani. The origin of Kagewani is also explained and there are some interesting new characters and new types...of monsters as well. Some of the old characters will also appear but in a new light. The animation is beautiful and unique and the storyline is chilling and tense. The show ended on a massive cliffhanger, so hopefully there will be a season three. of monsters as well.

The show ended on a massive cliffhanger, so hopefully there will be a season three.', 'Kagewani: Shou (Act II) is the second season to Kagewani which continues the interesting story which tells an intriguing narrative of the main character Sousuke Banba a genetic engineer and his investigations of surreal monsters in Japan. Kagewani: Shou continues after season one where Sousuke Banba constantly battles for equilibrium with the powerful Kagewani. Kagewani: Shou continues to use comic-like animation and suspenseful ambiance music that perfectly captures mise-en-scene, to create a thrillingly, interesting show that will leave you hooked and craving for more as the plot thickens. Although, the episodes are only roughly seven minutes and fifty seconds long it crams a lot of...drama, events, narrative progression and action per episode.What makes Kagewani: Shou a must watch anime show is the artistic portrayal of the characters and their involvement with the narrative and each other. The animation is unlike anything from other anime, it honestly looks and feels like a living and breathing coloured story straight from a Manga printing press. It also portrays the shows narrative to the ultimate climax at the end which deadly fight scenes and addictive dialogue. The music and sounds continue to feel like they were specifically chosen for their duty to create suspense, and giving that feeling of danger by sucking you into the story. Giving you feel you are there with the characters themselves, as they traverse the next chapter of the story.The only downsides are one, the show will most certainly leave you craving more. and two (once again) the season is too short.

A must see for the anime obsessed.', ""Kagewani Shou is one of those typical sequels that tried doing something different and new, but in that process it lost sight of what was actually good about the original and became bad as a result of this. If you liked the original Kagewani, then you will most likely not enjoy Kagewani Shou, because it went on a completely different route than its predecessor.The original Kagewani was a collection of short horror stories that were only loosely tied together by the central recurring characters of Banba and Kimura. In comparison to this Kagewani Shou tried to have a story, a controlled narrative and a...basic plot, which directly follows the ending of the original anime. This wouldn't be a problem by itself, but the sad fact is that the story that the writers of this anime came up is bland, generic and full of predictable clichés that you will see coming from a mile away if you are experienced in the genre. Worst of all, Kagewani Shou is more of a supernatural thriller than a horror anime, which is all the more reason you will not like it, if you were a fan of the first one.The fact that the original Kagewani didn't have much of a central story was something that actually worked greatly to its advantage in combination with the 8 minute episode limit in creating a mysterious and creepy atmosphere. Unfortunately Kagewani Shou is neither creepy nor mysterious. The reason it is not mysterious is because it tried too hard to be scientific and explain its monsters (even though it was not necessary), and like all dark monsters that are brought into the daylight, they too have lost their aura of mystery, because the audience was given too much information about them. And the reason the anime is not creepy (aside 1-2 episodes) is because most of the episodes are centered on characters who have supernatural powers (read: not normal, vulnerable humans) and as a result of this, the creepiness factor is completely lost because the characters can effortlessly fight back and destroy the monsters. In short, there is no real tension in this anime, which would be essential.In regards to the characters, this anime introduces two new recurring characters. One of them is an evil corporate executive whose sole purpose is to make Kimura (who already belongs to the same character archetype) look less evil by being even more evil than him. The other one is a ninja girl who might as well have come out of Naruto, because she behaves like a typical shounen character and can effortlessly eliminate all the supernatural creatures with just a swing of her katana. Neither of these two characters brought anything positive to the story, in fact they only brought it down with their presence. Aside from this, the relationship of the characters is also quite juvenile and makes little sense, for example Banba trusts and allies with Kimura for most of this season despite his betrayal at the end of season 1, while Ninja girl tries to kill Banba for no valid reason, then the next time they meet they are allies all of a sudden.The only things I can praise about this anime are its music and art. The music is very good at hyping up the shitty episodes and it is also similar to the soundtrack of the previous season. This season fortunately kept the unique aesthetics of the original anime (which is quite good looking), and on top of that, the animation itself improved a lot compared to the previous season.Overall this was a sequel that shouldn't even have been made, as it is worse than the original in all the important aspects. They didn't need to create anything new, they should have just done the same as season 1, but better and with more improvements.  I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone who liked the first Kagewani as a horror at all, instead I would recommend it to people who enjoy fast trainwrecks, because that is what Kagewani Shou is. The anime also ends on a cliff-hanger that is clearly setting up for a third season, but I'm genuinely hoping that their sales will trash and the studio abandons future Kagewani projects. basic plot, which directly follows the ending of the original anime.

The first season was a set of short horror stories tied together by certain characters. With the second one, there is a confusing story line.They tried to squeeze in 20 minuets worth of story into only 7 minutes. As you can imagine, it became very clear that they did not know what to do with it.The art and sound were okay, with the 'squelching' noise being the most clear. I liked the touch of binuaral here and there as characters voices shifted from ear to ear. One complaint I have...about sound is that I feel that they rely too heavily on it. The 'jump scares' rely purely on noise, as they are very predictable. While I understand that sound is there to submerge the watcher in the video, I feel like it was over-used here. They should've focused on making a more unpredictable jump scare, if that's what they were going for.In conclusion, I believe that the first series was better and more enjoyable :) about sound is that I feel that they rely too heavily on it.
